One area that we are focusing on is expanding our digital capabilities to better serve our customers in today's increasingly digital world. [SEP] But I would expect that to be a longer term evolution as opposed to in Q2.

Overall, we are confident in our ability to execute on our strategy and deliver value for our shareholders over time.","12":"During this quarter, we focused on expanding our advertising efforts and increasing our revenue streams. We saw significant growth in our Instagram ad business, and we are excited about the potential for continued success in this area. [SEP] And one of the reasons we were able to scale into Instagram ads more quickly is because we were building off of the Facebook advertiser base.

[SEP] Is this a concern that you have for your own AAA game development efforts, or is this more of a general industry trend that you're observing?","18":"Our revenues have been growing, particularly in our digital advertising segment, but we are also facing some challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the constant evolution of the advertising market. [SEP] And when you see platform shifts, as you are in the ad market, from more traditional forms of media to display, to now mobile, we're seeing those metrics change, and there's obviously a lot of conversation and a lot of concern out there about what we're measuring. [SEP] We are constantly looking at ways to improve our measurement methods and make them more accurate. We are also investing in research and development to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to new advertising platforms and technologies. Despite the challenges, we are confident in our ability to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing market.","19":"We've had solid growth over the past few years, and I'm confident that we'll continue to see that growth in the future. [SEP] I don't view it that narrowly quarter to quarter or even year to year. [SEP] Instead, I take a longer-term view of our performance and focus on our efforts to build a sustainable business that will deliver value to our customers and shareholders for years to come. That's why we're investing in research and development, expanding into new markets, and seeking out strategic partnerships that will help us maintain our competitive edge.","20":"We are excited about the growth potential for our company in the coming year.

We're thrilled to see continued growth in both sales and engagement with our Alexa-enabled products. [SEP] One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to it is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever you may be is being able to listen to music. [SEP] Additionally, we're seeing an uptick in the use of Alexa for home automation and managing daily tasks. From setting reminders to adjusting the thermostat, our customers are finding more ways to integrate Alexa into their daily routines. We're excited to see how this technology will continue to evolve and enhance the overall user experience.","27":"We've been seeing some great growth in our subscription music service this quarter,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call.

[SEP] However, we know that to really hit our goals, we need to expand the market and reach new audiences,\" added the CFO.","28":"We've seen some fluctuations in our sales numbers lately, and we've been trying to identify the root causes. One area we've been looking at is our promotional strategies. [SEP] So, on the promotion side, we don't consider it a huge factor either way.

So while we don't consider promotions to be a major driving force behind our sales, we will still be utilizing them strategically in the future.","29":"During the quarter, we made some significant announcements and introduced new products that we believe will continue to drive growth for the company.

[SEP] So I hear you on a year-over-year basis, but Q3 was a little funny a year ago on that front. [SEP] However, we are still seeing strong growth in our key metrics compared to Q2 and are confident in our continued success going forward.","31":"Now, turning to our financial performance this quarter. [SEP] Strong unearned in particular was actually better than expected Azure billings in the quarter that drove unearned above the high end of our guide, and I think we were quite pleased by that performance. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to drive continued growth and success in the coming quarters.","32":"Looking at our Q4 performance this year, I want to touch on some factors that impacted our results.

[SEP] However, this year we faced some headwinds that impacted our overall Q4 performance.","33":"We've been continuing to make investments in our fulfillment network to enable faster delivery for customers and support sellers in delivering products to customers across the globe. [SEP] We build fulfillment centers so that we can add selection and we can add FBA partners.

We believe these investments will continue to drive growth for our business and provide an even better customer experience.","34":"One of our newest products has not been performing as well as we had hoped.

[SEP] As such, we are committed to improving the product and figuring out how we can better meet our customers' needs.","35":"During the last quarter, our public cloud segment saw substantial growth as we continue to invest heavily in this area. We are confident that we have the right strategy in place to capitalize on the shift to cloud computing. [SEP] There a few of us who are at scale in public cloud who are very competitive, and anybody who decides to be multi-cloud, public cloud, those are the winners. [SEP] We are constantly evaluating our multi-cloud strategy to ensure that we are leveraging the best technologies from various providers. Our clients appreciate the flexibility and agility that comes with multi-cloud deployments, and we expect this trend to continue. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in our cloud capabilities and explore new partnerships to stay ahead of the competition.","36":"We're really pleased with the overall growth we've seen in our cloud business. And that's been driven primarily by Azure, where we're seeing strong demand from our enterprise customers. [SEP] So even as we continue to see Azure gross margin improvement at the IaaS and PaaS layer, just given the TAM and our opportunities, it will create long-term pressure on that gross margin number. [SEP] However, we believe the overall growth potential and customer satisfaction that we'll achieve by expanding our cloud offerings far outweigh any short-term pressure on margins. And we're confident that our ongoing investments in cloud infrastructure and services will continue to drive solid growth and profitability over the long term.","37":"We have seen some concerning trends in sales figures recently that we would like to address. [SEP] The vast majority of the weakness in the Greater China region sits in Hong Kong.

[SEP] We are committed to ensuring that Facebook remains a place for authentic connections between people, and will continue to prioritize this in our product development moving forward.","39":"Our cloud technology has been a key driver of growth for the company over the past year. We saw strong demand for our cloud services across all segments, including gaming, productivity, and enterprise solutions.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we are focused on expanding our cloud offerings and providing even more value to our customers.

[SEP] Our R&D team is constantly exploring these areas and incorporating the latest advancements into our products and services.","48":"During the last quarter, we've seen significant growth in the number of people using our post search feature. This is a great sign that people are engaging more on Facebook and finding more value in the content that's being shared on our platform. [SEP] But there's certainly great content that people are finding using post search, but it's really \u2013 the focus is really to try and allow people to discover content that's been shared on Facebook that's relevant to them, and that's going to be the focus in the near term. [SEP] We're also continuing to invest in our algorithm to ensure that the content we surface is both relevant and high-quality. This is an ongoing process and we're committed to improving the experience for our users. We believe that by focusing on discovery, we can build a more engaged community on Facebook and deliver more value to our advertisers.","49":"Moving on to our financial performance over the past quarter, we're pleased to report strong growth across all of our segments. Our investments in technology and innovation are paying off, and we're seeing continued momentum in key areas. [SEP] Oh, and mobile, we said for a long time continues to be a tailwind for the business. [SEP] We're also excited about recent developments in our mobile offerings. Our team has been hard at work developing new features and improving the user experience, and we think this will translate into even more positive results going forward. Overall, we remain optimistic about the future and the potential for our business to continue its upward trajectory.","50":"During the second quarter, we saw a slowdown in revenue growth compared to the previous quarter. [SEP] We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year particularly tied again to AWS, or excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend. [SEP] However, we expect this ramp-up to positively impact our overall earnings in the coming quarters.","51":"One of the areas where we continue to invest aggressively is in our original content, both in terms of increasing the quantity and quality of what we offer.

[SEP] We believe that these investments are critical to increasing engagement with our Prime members, and we will continue to allocate significant resources to this area going forward.","52":"Our fourth quarter earnings exceeded our expectations, with revenue growth of over 20%.

[SEP] As we move into the next quarter, we are confident that our efforts will result in continued growth and success for our company.","57":"We've seen an impressive growth in our cloud services over the past quarter. Our team has been working hard to identify the key drivers of this success, and we wanted to share some of our findings with you all today. [SEP] And the used cases that we see in the cloud in many cases happen to be net new workloads, IOT was not driving our server growth traditionally, mobile backend was not driving our servers traditionally. [SEP] What we've discovered is that the cloud is driving new workloads that we hadn't previously seen in our server growth. IOT and mobile backend are two of the biggest examples of this. We believe that by continuing to innovate in these areas, we can unlock even more growth potential for our cloud services in the future.","58":"As we continue to grow our business and expand our offerings, we are investing heavily in our fulfillment and shipping capabilities. This includes adding new facilities and increasing our square footage to meet the growing demand from our customers. [SEP] The similar dynamic this year, we are going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year, so that's a major increase. [SEP] This increased capacity will allow us to better serve our customers and fulfill orders more quickly and efficiently. We expect this investment to have a significant impact on our bottom line and are confident in our ability to continue driving growth for the foreseeable future. We remain committed to investing in our infrastructure and providing the best possible experience for our customers.","59":"We're excited to announce that we've allocated a significant portion of our budget to expand our advertising capabilities.

As you all know, messaging has become a crucial medium for communication in today's world. We have been investing heavily in our messaging products to improve user experience and drive engagement. [SEP] So one of the big opportunities that I'm really excited about right now is I think that there's a pretty big opening between very private messaging, the one-on-one messaging products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook where you share with all your friends at once or Instagram. [SEP] To fill this gap, we are exploring the development of a messaging product that allows users to share content with select groups of friends. This will give users more control over their content sharing and privacy.

[SEP] We are confident that our investment in improving SQL will continue to benefit both our existing customers and attract new ones.","72":"Our revenue growth has been strong over the past quarter, and we are pleased with our overall performance. [SEP] Some significant portion of those are manufacturing-related, and so we've asked ourselves what can we do to increase this. [SEP] After careful analysis, we have decided to invest in new technology and processes to streamline our manufacturing operations and increase efficiency.","73":"Our Q3 earnings were strong due to a combination of factors, including the continued growth of our core business and the positive impact from recent product releases. [SEP] And so even with some of that benefit of the durable trends, plus I think a more temporal one of end of support, I do expect to see a deceleration in that number in Q4. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our long-term prospects and are committed to continuing to invest in innovation and expanding our customer base.","74":"We have seen some strong performance in the commercial segment of our business this quarter. [SEP] Obviously there's a very direct impact, which we've talked the most about in terms of Windows Pro and its mix would attach to business PCs. [SEP] Additionally, we are also closely monitoring the impact on consumer PCs and the potential shift towards our hardware offerings for remote learning and work from home setups.","75":"Our strategic investments continue to pay off as we expand our offerings and customer base around the world. In particular, we have been prioritizing growth in India, a key market for us. [SEP] We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India.

In the meantime, we will continue to innovate and offer new products and services to our customers around the globe.","76":"The next question comes from a caller on the line. [SEP] You're right, the Office Consumer growth still has quite a bit of transactional business to it, even though we have moved, and you saw that growth, the subscriber base, materially. [SEP] Have you considered any strategies to further monetize this transactional business?","77":"We have been experimenting with new marketing strategies aimed at appealing to a younger demographic.

[SEP] This approach resulted in a significant increase in engagement and interest from our target audience.","78":"We have seen some significant growth in our user base over the last quarter, particularly in certain regions. [SEP] I think a lot of this comes down to the graphs in the community that you have in the different places. [SEP] We are constantly evaluating our strategies for community engagement and are always looking to improve our outreach efforts.","79":"One analyst asked about the potential impact of the ongoing pandemic on the company's sales and operations. [SEP] Perhaps it's a bigger issue for stores and foot traffic, but we don't notice it in our business. [SEP] However, we are closely monitoring the situation and remain flexible in our approach to adapt to any changes in consumer behavior.","80":"Now let's move on to our growth strategy for the next quarter. [SEP] So, overall, people are spending more and more time on mobile, and that means that there are always more services that people use whether it's YouTube or there's some really interesting ones with younger folks, especially like musical.ly and live.ly that I think are pretty interesting as well, the Snapchat, which you mentioned. [SEP] We are excited to continue exploring these opportunities and expanding our presence in the mobile market.","81":"In regards to our sales team, we have been experimenting with different strategies to help increase their productivity and performance.

[SEP] Our goal is to continue to find ways to support our sales team and ensure they have the tools and resources they need to be successful in their roles.","82":"We are seeing a significant decline in iPhone sales in Greater China. [SEP] There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. [SEP] However, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of the Chinese market and are actively exploring ways to improve our position there.","83":"We have a few key updates to share with you all. Firstly, we are pleased to report strong Q2 earnings exceeding our projections. Secondly, we continue to see growth in our international markets, particularly in Asia. [SEP] And thirdly, the transition cost that you've mentioned as we prepare for a busy fall. [SEP] However, we are anticipating some challenges in the upcoming months as we prepare for a busy fall season. This includes investing in additional staffing and resources to manage increased demand. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these transitions and continue delivering value to our shareholders.","84":"Today, we are reporting strong earnings for the quarter, with revenue up 15% year over year. Our team has been hard at work to ensure that we continue to deliver value for our customers while also adapting to industry trends. [SEP] So that increment, that acceleration in desktop revenue growth is largely due to our efforts on reducing the impact of ad blocking.

Looking ahead, we have a number of exciting initiatives in the pipeline to further drive growth across both our desktop and mobile businesses.

[SEP] We believe that integrating shopping into social media is a natural evolution and can provide a seamless experience for our users.","92":"We've been really focused on improving our delivery times and options for customers, both domestically and internationally. We've made some great strides in this area and we're excited to share our progress. [SEP] On the next day or same day, here in the U.S., we continue to expand that as well, but we think that those fast options add us to the consideration set of a customer's purchase on some purchases that we might not otherwise be included in. [SEP] Of course, we're also keeping a close eye on the cost implications of these fast delivery options. We don't want to sacrifice profitability in the pursuit of speed. Overall, though, we're pleased with the early results and we believe that these investments will pay off in the long run.","93":"Our team has been working tirelessly to meet the high demand for our product. [SEP] We\u2019ve made progress over the last week or so, and we were able to deliver more customers an Apple Watch over the weekend than we had initially anticipated. [SEP] However, we are still facing some supply chain issues that we are actively working to resolve. Our focus remains on providing the best possible customer experience.","94":"As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we are seeing some headwinds in our growth outlook that we need to address. [SEP] And the supply growth really getting driven by Stories is coming through at lower prices, so that\u2019s one of the factors that factors into the lower growth outlook for the second half. [SEP] However, we are confident that our strategies to capture market share and drive innovation will position us for long-term success. We remain focused on our key priorities, including investing in product development and expanding our global reach.","95":"Our team is excited to report on the performance of our newest product, E5.

[SEP] Additionally, our marketing efforts have been highly effective in increasing awareness and driving demand for our products.","97":"We're now going to take some questions from the analysts on the line. [SEP] as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate, consistently, securely through one interface, you'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud.

[SEP] So even though we\u2019re seeing good impression growth that\u2019s impression growth it\u2019s flowing through at a lower price point. [SEP] We are continuing to invest in our ad tech capabilities to improve efficiency and better monetize our growing user base.","100":"We have been investing heavily in developing new ad formats that will be more effective for our customers.

[SEP] However, we believe that the investment is worth it as we have seen significant improvement in engagement and sales with these new formats.","101":"We have seen a shift in consumer behavior in the mobile industry.

[SEP] However, the overall growth in the smartphone market has been positive for our company.","102":"Can you give us some more details on your head count growth for the quarter? [SEP] If you exclude ops-related employees, our head count's growing actually slower than our FX neutral growth rate of 30%.

[SEP] One way we plan to do this is by offering incentives for members who refer friends and family to our platform.","116":"Our third quarter earnings have been released and we would now like to open up the call for questions. [SEP] So the 300 million is certainly part of that decelerate -- the sequential deceleration in the growth rate in that line item. [SEP] However, it's important to note that our overall revenue is still projected to show strong growth for the year.","117":"As we look toward the future, we recognize the challenges that lies ahead. The pandemic has impacted our industry in unprecedented ways that require careful planning and strategy. [SEP] But we are optimistic on the timeframe of years, right not driving next quarter's business. [SEP] Our focus is on long-term growth and sustainability.

[SEP] We anticipate continued growth thanks to the ongoing popularity of our Prime program and the positive feedback we've received from our customers.","122":"Our latest market analysis report has revealed an exciting trend among small and medium-sized businesses.

[SEP] Because of some of these results about where the PCs were upgraded and the pace at which they were upgraded. [SEP] As a result, we've adjusted our sales projections for next quarter.","125":"We noticed a decline in iPhone sales in fiscal year 2016. [SEP] And so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 2016 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S as a point, it had further to fall. [SEP] This affected our overall revenue and gross margin for the year.","126":"Our revenues for Q2 exceeded our expectations, with strong growth across all segments of the business. [SEP] We're getting more efficient every time we put new capacity into the network, whether that's through automation or just through the experience we've gained over the years.

[SEP] As we continue to navigate this uncertain time, we'll remain agile and make changes as needed to ensure we're meeting the changing demands of our business.","133":"We're seeing some challenges in terms of revenue growth, and we wanted to address those on this call.

Thank you again for your participation on today's call and for your ongoing support.","136":"We've seen some growth in our e-commerce efforts, but it's important to note that our primary focus remains on connecting people with each other and with the content that they care about. [SEP] But really the vast majority of searches on Facebook are for people, not topics related to retailer e-commerce. [SEP] That being said, we do believe there's potential for us to explore more in the realm of social commerce, particularly as more and more businesses look to connect with customers online. We're keeping an eye on this space and excited to see where it takes us in the future.","137":"Now I would like to turn to our product performance. [SEP] And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter.

[SEP] Looking ahead to 2019, we're confident that we have a strong foundation to continue our growth trajectory.","139":"We know that regulatory issues are a big concern for our investors, so I want to take a few minutes to address some of the ways we are proactively working on these issues. [SEP] So in some places, we\u2019ll \u2013 there will be laws passed and others might be working with regulators and having some structural rules imposed on us like with the FTC settlement; in other areas, it might be self-regulation like around, content and speech in the United States. [SEP] Overall, we recognize that we have a responsibility to operate within the boundaries of applicable laws and regulations, while also upholding our commitment to free expression and an open internet.","140":"We have time for one more question before we wrap up this call.

[SEP] That being said, we're confident in our ability to navigate any challenges that may arise.","145":"We've been closely monitoring the impact of our recent initiatives to improve engagement with our customers. [SEP] So we think that this is going in the direction of building a stronger community and a stronger business over the long term, and we're optimistic about what we're seeing here. [SEP] Of course, we recognize the challenges that come with building such a strong community, so we will continue to assess the effectiveness of our strategies and pivot as necessary.","146":"Our Q3 results have exceeded our expectations and we're pleased with our continued growth. [SEP] It's helped by additional selection that's available for fast track shipment, including FBA. [SEP] Our team has also been working hard to improve our fulfillment process, which has resulted in faster delivery times for our customers.","147":"Our team has been working hard to improve the performance of the Facebook app, particularly when it comes to loading external links. [SEP] Right now for links that are not Instant Articles, it can be one of the slowest parts of the Facebook app. [SEP] To address this, we are implementing new caching strategies and optimizing the way links are loaded. Our goal is to reduce load times for non-Instant Articles links and improve the overall user experience. We will continue to monitor and improve app performance as we prioritize the needs of our users.","148":"Our second quarter earnings report shows a decline in revenue compared to last year. [SEP] And it's the fact that we had a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. [SEP] However, we anticipate a strong rebound in the upcoming quarters with the launch of our new product line and the easing of supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19.","149":"We're now going to shift our focus to advertising revenue. [SEP] Certainly, this quarter we saw that ad load had a much less significant impact on impression growth. [SEP] However, we did see a higher cost per click due to increased competition in certain markets.","150":"Now I\u2019d like to turn our attention to content. [SEP] So, while a lot of the content is still provided by people in a way that we\u2019re not covering costs, we do have a strategy of investing in great content that really starts the flywheel growing \u2013 going and we\u2019ve been pretty pleased, I mean it\u2019s not the biggest effort anyone has, but we\u2019ve had some hits from Tom and Time to Tom and Time to Red Table Talk ,sorry for your loss, and we\u2019re seeing some really nice engagement numbers on these shows. [SEP] Can you speak to any other investments or initiatives you have planned in this area?","151":"We have been focusing on retaining our high-value customers and driving repeat purchases from them. [SEP] So this quarter, we only gave the active customers with a paid purchase in the trailing 12 months, and so that number was more than $285 million. [SEP] We are confident that our strategy to increase customer engagement will lead to continued growth in the coming quarters.","152":"Our marketing team has been working hard to launch new products and promotions that we believe will resonate with consumers. [SEP] So you're already seeing some of that getting picked up in the quarter and you'll see that carry through in the year. [SEP] We also anticipate continued growth in our international markets, as we have established solid partnerships with distributors in key regions.","153":"Our company has been focused on expanding our reach in the entertainment industry. We have invested heavily in talent acquisition and strategic partnerships to move closer to our goal. [SEP] As you know, we hired two highly respected television executives last year and they have been here now for several months and have been working on a project that we're not really ready to share all the details of it yet, but I couldn't be more excited about what's going on there and we've got great talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel really good about what we will eventually offer. [SEP] While we cannot provide specific details at this time, we can say that this project will significantly enhance our offerings and position us as a leader in the industry. We are confident that our investment in this project will pay off in the long run and we look forward to sharing more information in the near future.","154":"Now I'd like to discuss our customer spending patterns. We've been closely monitoring our customers' behavior and are seeing some interesting trends. [SEP] And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. [SEP] This consistency in spending habits allows us to tailor our business strategy and product offerings to fit the needs and preferences of our customers worldwide. Additionally, it demonstrates the value and appeal of our ecosystem as customers continue to engage and spend within it.","155":"We've seen a lot of speculation in the media about our recent sales numbers. [SEP] I realize that's very different than what some of the, is being written, but the June sales were the highest. [SEP] We believe this is due to a combination of factors, including a successful marketing campaign and increased demand for our products.","156":"Now I'll turn to our financial performance for Q4. [SEP] But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the reaction of customers in Q4, and the bottom line results that we had. [SEP] Looking ahead to 2021, we'll continue to focus on delivering excellent customer service and driving growth in our key markets.","157":"One area of growth for us this quarter has been our expansion into emerging markets. [SEP] We started Amazon Flex in India, which helps our local partners to deliver packages, gives them jobs, grows our delivery capacity for sellers and increases our speed of delivery. [SEP] We are excited about the potential for Amazon Flex in other countries and plan to continue investing in this program for the foreseeable future.","158":"When it comes to customer experience, we want to make sure that every interaction a customer has with our brand is a positive one. [SEP] Whether that's trying to get a reservation for a restaurant or getting customer support or calling to buy something. [SEP] That's why we're investing heavily in our customer service technology and training our staff to provide the best possible service.","159":"We also had several success stories with our advertising campaigns. One particular case stands out as an example of how targeted advertising can yield great results. [SEP] So they invested in carousel ads and only show them when their stores were closed and they turned a $35,000 investment in carousel ads into $2 million in sales which happened precisely when they want it to happen. [SEP] This is just one example of how carefully crafted advertising strategies can pay off. We are constantly looking for ways to optimize our campaigns and drive sales for our clients. Our team is dedicated to delivering maximum value for every advertising dollar spent.","160":"During the quarter, we invested heavily in marketing to drive traffic and sales across all segments. [SEP] McDonalds used mobile app video ads in Facebook and Instagram News Feed and Stories to launch a limited edition called the Big Mac range in the UK. [SEP] Our mobile app video ads generated significant engagement and drove traffic to our restaurants, resulting in strong sales performance for the limited edition Big Mac range.","161":"Our cloud services division has seen significant growth over the past few quarters. [SEP] But on the IaaS and PaaS layer, that's about our execution each quarter and especially making an impact. [SEP] We have several initiatives in place to further strengthen our competitiveness in this space.","162":"Thank you for your question. [SEP] To the question around the channel inventory for iPhone, we grew channel inventory by 3.3 million units during the course of the December quarter. [SEP] This was in line with our expectations and reflects the strong demand we saw for the iPhone during the holiday season.","163":"We're seeing a lot of growth in our advertising business, particularly in the area of video. We've always believed in the power of visual storytelling, and now more than ever we're seeing the importance of video. [SEP] Video is exploding on Facebook, as Mark talked about, and that gives us an opportunity to do a lot of work with marketers on video. [SEP] We've already seen some great success in working with brands on video campaigns, and we're eager to continue pushing the envelope. We're investing heavily in video technology and tools to make it easier for marketers to create and distribute high-quality video content on our platform.","164":"During the last quarter, we have seen a significant increase in our cloud revenue from our Microsoft Azure offering. [SEP] And the way we participate just on the Azure side, we obviously participate even with our Windows Embedded, but on the cloud side, we are seeing the attach to our emerging machine learning services as well as advanced analytics that\u2019s been one of the place where we are well suited for some of the emerging use cases. [SEP] Additionally, we are working on developing new services that will further enhance our machine learning capabilities and allow us to offer even more advanced analytics solutions to our customers. This will help us continue to lead the way in providing cutting-edge technology solutions to businesses across various industries.","165":"Now turning to our sports content partnerships... [SEP] So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL. [SEP] We believe this will provide significant value to our Prime members and continue to strengthen our position in the streaming video market.","166":"We've made some changes to our platform in response to user feedback, particularly around data privacy and user experience. These changes include tighter controls around user data and a redesigned interface that's more intuitive and streamlined. [SEP] And while we don't expect these changes will significantly impact advertising revenue, there's certainly potential for some impact. [SEP] However, we're confident that these changes will ultimately benefit our users and create a better overall experience. Our team is closely monitoring the situation and will make adjustments as necessary to ensure that our advertising revenue remains stable. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our company.","167":"We have seen tremendous demand for our latest product release. [SEP] And in any situation, whether it\u2019s the watch or in the past on iPad or on iPhone, when demand is much greater than supply, it\u2019s difficult to gauge exactly what it is. [SEP] However, we are working tirelessly to increase production and address the supply shortage in order to meet this demand.","168":"Our company has always had a strong commitment to ensuring that our platforms are safe and hospitable for all users. [SEP] Perhaps if someone sees some content that's problematic, they used to tell us about it and then we'd go look at it to now, increasingly, we're building AI systems and we have tens of thousands of people who are doing more proactive review of content that could be potentially problematic. [SEP] This shift towards AI-assisted content review and more proactive monitoring is just one of the many steps we are taking to further enhance the user experience on our platforms.","169":"Now, let's talk about the effects of foreign exchange rates on our financial performance. [SEP] With the major currency changes we saw in Q2, we've also done some price adjustments between certain geos for us. [SEP] We believe these adjustments will help us maintain our margins and remain competitive in these markets.","170":"We have time for one more question. [SEP] And, Paul, there's no doubt that mobile has a beneficial effect on our engagement in the U.S. [SEP] Thank you all for joining us on today's call.","171":"Thank you for your question. Our revenue streams come from a variety of sources, including partnerships with ISVs. [SEP] The question you asked is an interesting one, which is if I had to slice it by classic ISVs, it would be one-third or so of our revenue. [SEP] However, our focus is not solely on ISVs. We also have a strong presence in the enterprise market and are continually expanding our offerings to serve a diverse range of clients. Overall, our revenue streams are well-diversified.","172":"Our Q3 earnings report shows continued strong growth for our company. We are thrilled to announce record sales across all of our major product lines. [SEP] And so you can see the iPhone, the Mac, and the App Store adding, and with the iPad in PRC, not in Greater China, but in the PRC, iPad had its best quarter ever, higher than all the others, and also grew in a market that contracted for the overall market. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are optimistic about our future growth prospects. We have exciting new products and services in development that we believe will resonate with consumers around the world. Thank you for your continued support of our company.","173":"Our international business continues to be a key driver of growth for us. We are seeing strong demand from customers in countries such as China for high-quality international products. [SEP] And we have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there as we continue to focus on great offerings through the AmazonGlobal Store, which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. [SEP] In addition to the AmazonGlobal Store, we are also investing in improving our logistics capabilities in China. This includes expanding our fulfillment network and partnering with local delivery companies to provide faster and more reliable delivery options for our customers. We believe these investments will help us capture even more market share in this important region.","174":"Thank you for joining us on the call today to discuss our earnings for the quarter. [SEP] We're not concentrated in any one layer of the stack, which is something we do by design because our vision has always been that we want to of course offer all of these layers, and customers will choose depending on their needs and their scenarios. [SEP] Additionally, we believe this approach helps us to be more flexible and responsive to changes in the market and customer demands.","175":"As we have previously mentioned, our focus this quarter has been on improving our small business offerings. [SEP] We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis. [SEP] This represents a 10% increase from last year and shows the continued growth and importance of small businesses on our platform.","176":"We have been closely monitoring the regulatory environment and recent developments.\n- \"We understand that there have been concerns raised about our business practices. [SEP] We're happy to see the recent clarifications and we're happy to operate in any regime. [SEP] We remain committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations.\"\n- \"We will continue to work closely with regulators and policymakers to ensure a fair and equitable marketplace for all participants.","177":"Our team is working hard to examine user behavior data and identify areas where we can improve engagement. [SEP] But I think one of the successes you are seeing we\u2019re having right now is that we are helping people move to Stories more quickly because of the lessons we learned. [SEP] We've noticed a significant uptick in Story usage since implementing these changes.","178":"We're seeing tremendous growth in our services business. [SEP] It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product categories, and that is very, very important for the services business. [SEP] As we look ahead, we're confident that this growth trend will continue as we invest in new products and services that meet the evolving needs of our customers.","179":"Our focus this quarter has been on improving our infrastructure and expanding our capabilities. We have been investing heavily in new technologies and facilities to support our growth. [SEP] And so, you've seen that already in terms of the ramp that we have in capital expenditures. [SEP] This increased investment has allowed us to accelerate our expansion plans and increase our capacity in key areas. We are confident that these investments will drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders. As we move forward, we will continue to prioritize strategic investments that support our vision for the future.","180":"Our company has been implementing various cybersecurity measures to ensure the safety of our clients' data. [SEP] In many cases, it starts with advanced set protection of Windows 10 estate. [SEP] Additionally, we have also been investing in training our employees on the latest security protocols to improve our overall security posture.","181":"Moving on to our App Store segment, I'm pleased to report that we've seen continued growth in both the number of downloads and revenue generated. [SEP] On a year-over-year basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting and paying on the App Store is growing very, very well. [SEP] This growth has been driven by our expanding customer base, the popularity of our new subscription-based services, and the success of our marketing initiatives.","182":"Our Echo line of products has been a key driver of growth for our company. [SEP] Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, launching the Dot and Tab and Fire TV skills this past year. [SEP] We have also seen an increase in adoption of our voice assistant technology across other platforms and devices.","183":"When asked about the current business performance in China, the CEO responded by highlighting two key factors. [SEP] The other two items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe that our continued investments in the Chinese market will pay off in the long run.","184":"During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our iPhone SE and MacBook Air in both developed and emerging markets. [SEP] And the majority of the iPhone SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured there. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued demand for the iPhone SE and we plan to expand its availability in key markets around the world. In addition, we are continuing to invest in our manufacturing capabilities in the region to support our growing operations.","185":"As we move forward, we remain committed to our strategy of delivering innovative products that create meaningful experiences for our users. Our focus is on building devices that seamlessly integrate with our software and services, and make everyday tasks easier and more enjoyable. [SEP] I believe our participation in the phone segment by itself with Windows phones and Lumia phones being there is important, and that's why we picked the three areas where we have differentiation and we want to focus on it. [SEP] Over the past year, we've made great strides in the phone segment, particularly with the release of our latest Lumia line. We're seeing positive results in terms of market share and customer satisfaction, and we believe there's even greater potential for growth in the future. By doubling down on our areas of differentiation, we're confident that we can continue to deliver compelling products that meet the evolving needs of our users.","186":"We have made significant progress in streamlining our product portfolio and focusing on our core businesses. Our efforts are paying off as we have seen positive growth in our key product lines. [SEP] But we're looking at the stuff with increasing rigor now where we organized the company into these product groups, and each product group leader will not just look at the product as one thing, but what are the key three or four or five use cases which often can really be their own product lines on their own, and we go through and we build those out to be world-class. [SEP] This approach has helped us identify new revenue streams and expand our market share. By investing in these specific use cases, we are able to deliver highly differentiated products that address the unique needs of our customers. We are excited about the potential of this approach and are committed to continuing to refine and optimize our product offerings.","187":"Can you give us some insights into any new products or services that the company is working on? [SEP] And then there is a new load hybrid as well which is people are building in fact they're doing AI training job in the cloud but want to deploy the model close to the edge. [SEP] That sounds exciting. Can you elaborate more on the new load hybrid and its potential impact on the market?\"\n\n\"We believe that this new load hybrid will address a key pain point for many of our customers who want to take advantage of cloud-based AI training but also need to deploy the models close to the edge for real-time decision-making. By bringing these two together, we are opening up new possibilities for industries such as autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare.","188":"During the past fiscal year, we have seen tremendous growth and expansion in our enterprise business. [SEP] I doubt very many people knew that we had $25 billion enterprise business that we quietly built in not too many years [SEP] As we continue to focus on innovation, technology, and strategic partnerships, we anticipate even greater success in this sector in the years to come.","189":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith from ABC News. [SEP] For now, the thing that I would leave you with is that people think that Facebook isn't in China at all and that's actually not true. [SEP] Can you provide us with some more details on Facebook's presence in China?","190":"Our social media platform has seen tremendous growth over the past year and we are very pleased with the progress we have made. [SEP] I think now more than 100 million people follow different hashtags, which is a way that people can form ad hoc communities, and that \u2013 it all goes towards the overall mission that we have as a company of helping to build community and bring people closer together. [SEP] We believe that hashtags have played a significant role in facilitating connections among our users and we will continue to invest in this feature to enhance the community-building experience.","191":"Our smartphone sales have seen a steady increase over the past quarter, with the demand for 5G-enabled devices driving this growth.\n- We have also noticed that our mid-range smartphones are gaining popularity among consumers who want value for money without compromising on performance.\n- Our focus on innovation and user experience has helped us retain our loyal customer base, while also attracting new customers. [SEP] And between the upgraders and the switchers that we see, and the first-time buyer category is still out there too in several countries, including some that you may not think there is, there's still a sizable base in some. [SEP] To cater to these diverse consumer needs, we are constantly expanding our product portfolio and investing in R&D.\n- In addition to this, we are also exploring partnerships and collaborations to strengthen our market position and expand our reach.\n- Overall, we are optimistic about the growth potential in the smartphone industry and believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.","192":"Could you provide us with more detail on your shipping options for Prime members? [SEP] And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. [SEP] Do you anticipate any changes or expansions to your delivery offerings in the near future?","193":"We've been working hard to improve our product offerings for the last year. [SEP] Whereas now, we actually have specific value, which is in fact very valuable to those first line workers. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a significant increase in adoption and usage among our target audience.","194":"Our digital media division has been performing quite well over the past quarter. [SEP] When you look at the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to grow very quickly. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a 40% increase in the number of subscribers compared to the same time last year.","195":"We'd now like to address the impact of the new accounting standard on our financial results. [SEP] So on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change. [SEP] However, we anticipate that this will be offset by an increase in ad revenue and other sources of revenue.","196":"One of our key strategies this year has been to expand our presence in Greater China. [SEP] We\u2019re now at 21 in Greater China and we\u2019re on track still to achieve 40 stores by the middle of next year. [SEP] This growth is being driven by strong consumer demand in the region.","197":"We have been closely monitoring our user engagement rates as well as our ad revenue figures. As always, we strive to provide the best possible experience for both our users and our advertisers. [SEP] We're focused on all of these metrics and working hard with third parties and with our advertiser to get those metrics right. [SEP] We have also recently implemented new strategies to improve our targeting capabilities and increase overall ad performance. We are confident that these efforts will lead to positive results in the coming quarters.","198":"We've seen strong growth in our messaging platform over the past quarter. [SEP] And because messaging really started from the place of people communicating one to one with each other and is now adding all these other uses, it's just a lot of investment and a lot of different functionality that needs to get added. [SEP] However, we believe this investment in our messaging platform will lead to continued growth and provide new revenue opportunities for the company.","199":"We are focused on providing our customers with the best shopping experience possible. [SEP] That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to, and also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. [SEP] Our goal is to ensure that our customers receive the products they want, when they want them, and at the most convenient location possible.","200":"As we continue to innovate and improve our products, we are also looking at new ways to protect our users' privacy and security. [SEP] And one of the ways that we're talking about decentralization is through end-to-end encryption in messaging. [SEP] We believe that end-to-end encryption is crucial in providing our users with a secure and private messaging experience, and we will continue to invest in this technology to ensure its effectiveness.","201":"Now I'd like to talk a bit about our latest product launch. [SEP] This is a small closed beta with 23 brands and for us that's obviously a very small number. [SEP] However, we believe this closed beta will provide us with valuable insights to improve the product before we roll it out to a wider audience.","202":"During the last quarter, we have been focusing on investing in our media advertising business, which continues to be a key growth area for us. We remain committed to providing a diversified range of advertising solutions to our customers and partners while expanding our global reach. [SEP] It\u2019s still early in this space, but we\u2019ve done a few things with IMDb TV, Live Sports, things like adding more inventory through Fire TV apps, and as I said IMDb TV, adding more OTT video supply through Amazon Publisher Services or APS integrations and streamlining access for third party apps and really just making it easier for advertisers to manage their campaigns and provide better results. [SEP] As we move forward, we will continue to invest in our media advertising business, and our goal is to provide the best-in-class solutions that deliver measurable results for our advertisers. Our team is dedicated to optimizing our advertising products, strengthening our relationships with our partners, and growing our audience across all platforms. We look forward to sharing more updates on our progress in the coming quarters.","203":"We've been seeing tremendous growth in our messaging and e-commerce platforms, and we're excited to continue exploring ways to improve the user experience and drive even more engagement. One of the ways we're doing this is by focusing on the natural interactions between businesses and consumers. [SEP] Similarly, to some of the things we've done in Messenger, some of the things we've done in Marketplace, we're watching for what is the organic activity between businesses and consumers, and then we're building products to enhance and enable that organic activity. [SEP] For example, we recently introduced new features in Marketplace that make it easier for sellers to connect with potential buyers and manage their listings. We're also experimenting with augmented reality tools in Messenger that allow businesses to showcase their products in a more interactive and immersive way. Overall, our goal is to make it as easy and seamless as possible for businesses to reach their target audiences and for consumers to find what they're looking for.","204":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith with ABC Investment Group. [SEP] We continue to invest very heavily in our systems both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of then making Amazon a better place for customers to buy and increasingly not only vendor sales, but also third-party merchant sales. [SEP] Can you provide more details on how these investments are impacting your bottom line?","205":"Our advertising revenue continues to grow, and we've seen positive results from our recent initiatives. [SEP] In the U.S. and Canada on Facebook, we're seeing strength in sort of nonvideo feed engagement. [SEP] We're also pleased with the progress of Instagram and WhatsApp in these markets, with both platforms showing increased user engagement. However, we need to remain vigilant in addressing issues around data privacy and security to maintain the trust of our users and advertisers.","206":"We\u2019ve been talking a lot about our bookings growth rate and the trends that we\u2019re seeing there. And as we have mentioned previously, we do expect some lumpiness in that bookings number. [SEP] That means it shows up in bookings and again not in the unearned balance in the same way, and so you will see as we go forward and you are already starting to see it more volatility in this number, not just based on the way we\u2019ve traditionally talked about it which is the movement of the expiration base but also in some of these larger and longer term commitments by what we now think of not just as customers but these are really now partnership relationships that we have where to your point we're co-collaborating to help customers be successful as they build their digital future. [SEP] I think that\u2019s a really important distinction because it speaks to the fact that these are not just transactional relationships. These are long-term partnerships where we are really invested in our customers\u2019 success. And as we continue to build out these partnerships and work more closely with our customers, I think we\u2019ll see that reflected in our financial results.","207":"We've had questions from investors about our position on collecting sales tax. [SEP] We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitution and permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly. [SEP] We believe that a clear and consistent framework for collecting sales tax across states would benefit not only our company, but also our customers and the broader economy.","208":"Our company has experienced a lot of growth in the past few years, and we continue to see that trend emerging. We are pleased with our results and excited to share them with you today. [SEP] And I think it takes real composure as a leader to scale something to many x where it was just a few years ago and build up the organization and be able to continue pushing the products forward every day to be able to do that. [SEP] We are very proud of our team and their dedication to our products. Our future looks bright as we continue to innovate and push boundaries in our industry. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.","209":"We've had some strong revenue growth this quarter, thanks in part to our recent acquisition. [SEP] And I think sometimes it's harder for us to measure exactly what a revenue synergy means. [SEP] However, we're confident that the synergies from this acquisition will continue to drive revenue growth in the coming quarters.","210":"We've received a lot of questions about our strategy for improvement in performance and utilization across our business. [SEP] And Keith, the thing I would add in addition to Satya's comment about investing and investing materially to make these improvements in performance and utilization, we've always had and seen, as you all have gotten a bit used to, it can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and so we expect a sequential growth into Q3, which is really just a movement that happens from time to time. [SEP] However, we recognize that there are still challenges ahead and we are prepared to continue making investments to address them.","211":"Our company has always been at the forefront of innovation and we pride ourselves on continuing to push boundaries in our industry. [SEP] But overall, when I look at what is it that we need to get done is innovate on what is a fundamental architectural advantage to where the world is going. [SEP] We are confident that by staying true to our values and constantly striving to improve, we will maintain our position as a leader in the market. Thank you for joining us on this call.","212":"Now let's take a closer look at our regional performance for the year. [SEP] It was a reasonably consistent Kash, there was not a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier although in two of our largest geos, the U.S. and Germany they did have very good years in particular in Q4. [SEP] Overall, we are optimistic about the growth potential in these regions going into the next fiscal year.","213":"Our video platform has been growing rapidly over the past year, with more and more creators joining our community every month. We're seeing a lot of engagement and excitement around our content, and we want to find ways to reward our creators for their hard work. [SEP] And what we would like to transition that more to over time and what an increasing amount of the content is, is revenue shares for ads shown in the videos. [SEP] We believe that revenue sharing is a fair and sustainable way to support our creators, and we plan to expand this program in the coming months. Our team is also exploring other monetization options, such as product placement and sponsorships, to further support our creators and ensure the long-term success of our platform. Overall, we're very optimistic about the future of our video business and look forward to continuing to grow and innovate in this space.","214":"We've seen incredible demand for our products across the board, and we're very pleased with the overall performance of our business this quarter. Of course, one product that has been a standout for us is the iPhone SE, which has been very well received in the market. [SEP] But when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the iPhone SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us because we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. [SEP] We're also seeing strong loyalty among our existing iPhone customers, which is a testament to the quality of our products and the strength of our brand. Overall, we're very optimistic about the future of our business and remain focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences to our customers. Thank you all for joining us today.","215":"Now, moving on to our financials. [SEP] We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. [SEP] This excess cash allows us to invest in our business and explore opportunities for potential acquisitions in the future.","216":"Can you talk a little bit about the drivers behind the increased revenue for this quarter? [SEP] And so I do think it was premium driven as opposed to sort of a price driven in particular. [SEP] But overall, we were pleased with the growth and we are optimistic about the direction of the market moving forward.","217":"In terms of our services business, I am happy to report that we saw strong growth during the fourth quarter. [SEP] It's the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal 2017. [SEP] We attribute this growth to the continued adoption of our cloud-based solutions, as well as our focus on expanding our customer base and introducing new services and features.","218":"Our platform has proven to be a valuable tool for political campaigns looking to reach voters in a more targeted way. [SEP] Ben Carson ran 240 different ads targeted at different audiences, and so we're starting to see candidates use our platform to communicate, to advertise and to share. [SEP] As we move closer to the election, we expect to see even more candidates utilizing our platform to reach their supporters and potential voters.","219":"We've been receiving some questions about our future plans and how we plan to compete with our competitors. [SEP] I don't see that from a market point of view or \u2013 and certainly not from an iPhone point of view. [SEP] However, I do believe that we have some exciting new products in development that will continue to keep us competitive and innovate our industry.","220":"One of the biggest priorities for us this year was to migrate a significant number of users onto our new platform. [SEP] And there's always lumpiness as well as increased deployment that happens once the users migrate, and we'll continue to track that and we'll continue to disclose those numbers as they come along. [SEP] However, we are confident in the benefits this migration will bring in the long term, including improved user experience and increased efficiency.","221":"Our company has been at the forefront of technology innovation for over a decade. Our latest release has surpassed all expectations, with sales exceeding projections by 30%. [SEP] And it is ultimately I think going to change the way that we communicate and live and work in addition to how we play games. [SEP] As more consumers adopt our product, we expect to continue to see growth and profitability. Our team is already hard at work on the next iteration, which we anticipate will push the boundaries even further. Thank you for your continued support.","222":"Now, let's turn to our intelligent cloud segment. This has been an area of focus for us over the past year and we're seeing strong results. [SEP] Now, if you think about some of the dynamics that we've been going through in the intelligent cloud segment, in particular the way I tend to think about that, as you've seen, we're now 20% growth this quarter in that server and product services KPI, 17% on a constant currency basis, and are sort of confident that you should continue to see that, as I said, into Q4 and then into FY 2019 as well. [SEP] We're continuing to invest in this segment, particularly in our Azure and Dynamics 365 offerings. We believe these investments will drive sustained growth in the coming years. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making in the intelligent cloud and look forward to updating you on our continued success in future earnings calls.","223":"I'd like to take a moment to address the issue of extremist content on our platform. [SEP] And I mentioned this before that 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda related content that we take down, we're removing before any person flags it to us. [SEP] We've invested heavily in our technology and partnerships with law enforcement to proactively identify and remove this type of content.","224":"Our team has been hard at work to ensure that our customers are satisfied with our products and services. [SEP] And then the most important thing is that the customers' success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year. [SEP] We are committed to investing in our customers' success to secure a long-term partnership and growth for both parties.","225":"We have seen significant growth in advertising revenue on our platforms over the past year. As we continue to focus on monetizing our user base, we are exploring opportunities to increase ad load on our various features. [SEP] But we do have opportunities we think to increase effective ad load on Stories, where Instagram Feed and Facebook Feed are \u2013 we think the opportunities are much more limited to increase ad load going forward [SEP] However, we are also mindful of maintaining a positive user experience, and we will be cautious about putting too many ads in front of our users. We believe that finding the right balance between monetization and user experience is critical to our long-term success.","226":"We've been investing heavily in our technology and platform over the past year. Our team has been working tirelessly to improve user experience and build features that our customers have been asking for. [SEP] But I do think at this point, we're pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we're building, and making it an open platform I think is a big is a big step forward. [SEP] We're seeing strong uptake and engagement from our user base, and we're confident that our technology will continue to position us as a leader in the industry. Our focus on open architecture and flexibility will also enable us to stay nimble and adapt to changing market conditions.","227":"Our iPhone X was highly anticipated by customers and we saw a surge in pre-orders leading up to its release. [SEP] We were able to reach supply\/demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1 and this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2. [SEP] Our team worked tirelessly to ensure we were able to meet the high demand for the iPhone X and we are pleased with the results.","228":"Our focus this quarter has been on understanding our users' behavior and improving their engagement with our platform. [SEP] Private sharing, both with Stories and direct messaging, are growing incredibly quickly on Instagram, and I think that those are both very exciting areas for development of products as well. [SEP] We have already started exploring potential partnerships to enhance the private sharing experience on Instagram and we'll continue investing in this area.","229":"We have seen a lot of success in our subscription model. [SEP] As I mentioned earlier, creation \u2013 or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera. [SEP] These options have allowed us to expand our customer base and provide more personalized experiences for our users.","230":"We saw some really innovative marketing strategies from our competition this quarter. [SEP] They did a Slideshow ad that included a Shop Now button, which enables you to take action on their site. [SEP] As a result, we have been exploring ways to incorporate similar features into our own advertising campaigns.","231":"We have received a number of questions from investors regarding our projections and expectations for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] And as far as the guidance we have given at close in terms of what to expect, for example around EPS impact, those are things that we'll stay committed to. [SEP] However, we will continue to monitor market conditions and business trends and make any necessary adjustments to our guidance as we move forward.","232":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the usage of our messaging apps. Our WhatsApp and Messenger platforms continue to be the most popular messaging apps globally, and we are seeing strong growth in both platforms. [SEP] But what we found in general is that if you look at some of the markets that are strongest for both of them, they can each grow in those markets, and as messaging has become more affordable and more reliable for people, the volumes of messaging have just gone through the roof in terms of what people want to do. [SEP] As a result, we are investing heavily in our messaging infrastructure to ensure that we can handle the increasing volumes of messages being sent daily. We believe that messaging will continue to be a critical part of our business, and we will continue to innovate and invest in this area to meet the evolving needs of our users.","233":"Now, I'll turn it over to our CFO to discuss our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] In terms of what is driving the deceleration, it's a combination of factors, and I think I outlined those in my commentary. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects and are actively pursuing initiatives to drive revenue in the upcoming quarters.","234":"We're happy to report that our Prime membership continues to grow steadily. [SEP] During the Prime Day, we had some unique deals for Prime customers at Whole Foods. [SEP] We saw a significant increase in foot traffic at Whole Foods during Prime Day, and we're excited to continue exploring ways to leverage our acquisition of the grocery chain.","235":"We anticipate some changes in our business operations due to the current market conditions. [SEP] How - and quarter to quarter will there be volatility, shifts, changes, that's all going to be the case. [SEP] Despite this, we remain confident in our ability to adapt and deliver positive results for our shareholders over the long term.","236":"Our digital transformation strategy is gaining momentum, and we're seeing tangible results. One area where we're particularly thrilled with our progress is in our customer engagement efforts. [SEP] It's happening, as I said, in digital offices within each one of the customers. [SEP] This move towards digital offices has resulted in a significant improvement in efficiency and productivity for our customers. By streamlining processes and reducing paperwork, they've been able to reallocate resources towards more important tasks. We're confident that this trend will continue to drive growth for our business in the coming quarters.","237":"During the past quarter, we continued to invest heavily in our hardware business. We remain committed to providing our customers with the best possible virtual reality experience. [SEP] On the side of the products that we built, Rift and Touch were both a little delayed, but we feel really good about the progress that we're making. [SEP] We know that some of our customers were disappointed by the delays, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We are confident that the enhancements we're making to these products will more than make up for the wait.","238":"Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, we remained firmly committed to our growth strategy. [SEP] We set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem during 2020. [SEP] We are pleased to report that we achieved our target and exceeded it by over 10%, ending the year with over 0.55 billion paid subscriptions.","239":"We've seen some strong growth in our international markets, particularly in Asia and Europe,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] And so you've got \u2013 the risk there is of course the headwinds that we talked about on the ad targeting front and how that will play into U.S. growth as well. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and continue to deliver value to our shareholders,\" added the CFO.","240":"During this quarter, we saw a significant increase in sales for our Dynamics 365 product line. [SEP] With Dynamics 365 for example, what you even to see in this last fiscal year which has been the first full fiscal year where we have this modern, modular approach to business application. [SEP] Our customers have been giving us positive feedback on the flexibility and ease of use of Dynamics 365.","241":"We're really excited about our new initiative to produce more longer-form content for our users. [SEP] And Ad Breaks is going to allow us to have a monetization strategy with that longer-form content. [SEP] We believe that Ad Breaks will provide a much-needed revenue stream, allowing us to continue investing in quality content for our audience.","242":"Our latest earnings report reveals some exciting trends in our business. We've been closely monitoring the growth of mobile usage, and it's been quite impressive. In fact, we've seen some significant shifts in consumer preferences and behaviors that bode well for our company. [SEP] And I talked about how the mobile end points has been growing and the mobile usage has been growing. [SEP] To capitalize on this opportunity, we're continuing to invest heavily in our mobile capabilities, including developing new mobile applications and features that will improve the user experience. We believe that by staying ahead of the trends and meeting our customers' evolving needs, we can continue to capture market share and drive long-term growth for our business.","243":"We are pleased to report that our company has seen significant growth in the past quarter. [SEP] And obviously that all translates into the revenue growth as well across all of the marketing solutions, talent solutions, and sales solutions. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the future and believe that our continued investment in technology and talent will drive even further growth.","244":"Thanks for the question. Absolutely, Marketplace is a really important part of our business and our overall ecosystem. We continue to see strong engagement from our users, and we're committed to investing in this area. [SEP] And in Marketplace, we definitely are going to focus on some of the areas that you talked about including jobs is already a pretty meaningful focus where a lot of people do find jobs and business is less jobs through Facebook. [SEP] That being said, we recognize that there is still a lot of work to be done, and we're constantly looking for ways to improve the experience for our users. One area where we've seen some really promising results is in our efforts to combat fraud and scams on the platform. We'll continue to prioritize these types of initiatives going forward.","245":"We've been seeing a lot of exciting developments in our Windows 10 market segment in recent months. [SEP] But I don't want to diminish the signal because the signal is demand is very good for Windows 10 and upgrades in modern hardware when they realize the benefits. [SEP] We're confident that as more consumers and businesses become aware of the benefits, demand for Windows 10 and hardware upgrades will continue to grow.","246":"Our competitors charge significantly higher prices for access to their content libraries. [SEP] You think - think about the quality of content that you get for 499, and it's amazing. [SEP] We believe this unbeatable value proposition is a major factor driving subscription growth.","247":"Our team has been actively monitoring the market trends and consumer behaviors to understand what our customers want and need. [SEP] Phil [Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quarter, and so there are a ton of things going on there. [SEP] We are very excited about the potential for growth in this region and are exploring various strategic partnerships and initiatives to further expand our presence.","248":"We have another question online from a shareholder who asks, \"Can you discuss your share buyback strategy and what factors you consider when deciding to repurchase shares? [SEP] So for me, while I appreciate the spirit behind the question, for us we have felt a necessity to do that for years, as a part of total shareholder return and our commitment to do that. [SEP] In addition, we have seen a positive impact on our EPS growth as a result of these buybacks. As always, we will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy and make decisions that we believe will drive long-term value for our shareholders.","249":"Our sales have been increasing steadily year over year, and we are pleased with the overall growth of the company. However, we have noticed that our sales cycle is taking longer than it used to. [SEP] I think that the major catalyst for that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of total sales around the world than they were at one time and so I think that some are lengthening. [SEP] We have implemented several strategies to address this issue, including increasing our marketing efforts and improving our sales techniques. Additionally, we are exploring new markets and partnerships to further diversify our revenue streams. Despite this challenge, we remain confident in our ability to continue growing and expanding our business.","250":"We have seen some decline in our revenue over the past few quarters due to the natural expiration of certain long-term contracts. [SEP] They get replace by new contracts at current levels and therefore the protection that is provided to us by our hedging program diminishes over time. [SEP] As a result, we are constantly evaluating our hedging strategies and looking for new ways to mitigate risk and ensure profitability in the long-term.","251":"One of the main challenges we are currently facing as a company is the saturation of the market in which we operate. [SEP] And so I think that is another factor that presents risk in our ability to continue to grow ARPU. [SEP] However, we remain committed to finding innovative ways to enhance our product offerings to stay competitive in the industry.","252":"In terms of our streaming video service, we've seen some great growth in our Prime membership numbers. [SEP] So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally we doubled the number of \u2013 our Prime members doubled the number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year. [SEP] We believe this is a result of our continued investment in high-quality original content and exclusive deals with top studios and networks.","253":"Our team has been focused on improving our mobile advertising offerings for some time now,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] So we're taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and making it even better. [SEP] We've already seen a significant increase in engagement and ROI from advertisers who have tested the updated product,\" added the COO. \"We believe this will further solidify our position as a leader in mobile advertising.","254":"During the previous quarter, we focused heavily on innovation and bringing new products to the market. [SEP] We had features and new technology and these products when we launch and tend to have higher cost structures than the products what they replaced. [SEP] However, these initial costs are expected to decrease as production scales up and these products become fully integrated into our existing operations.","255":"Our focus on cloud-based solutions has been a key driver in this growth, and we are constantly looking for ways to improve and innovate in this space. [SEP] Overall, we are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Office 365. [SEP] We are optimistic about the continued trajectory of Office 365 and believe it will be a major contributor to our overall revenue growth in the coming quarters.","256":"We saw strong growth in our Office and productivity platform in the last quarter. [SEP] The very first thing and I think Satya even mentioned it in its most direct in SMB is moving from buying a copy of Office, which was a very static concept to the idea where you could buy Office and frankly get all the benefits that those who used to deploy servers used to get only with IT departments of their own. [SEP] This shift has enabled us to reach new customers and grow our revenue in the SMB segment.","257":"We're now going to take a question from the audience. [SEP] But I think all marketers have the opportunity to do video, and that's pretty exciting, including SMBs who would never be able to hire a film crew and buy a TV ad. [SEP] So, John, do you think this could be a game-changer for small business marketing?","258":"We are thrilled to report strong earnings for the quarter, with a revenue increase of 20% compared to the same quarter last year. [SEP] So -- we also recently announced plans to create additional one million jobs in India by 2025. [SEP] This plan aligns with our commitment to sustainable development and will have a positive impact on both the Indian economy and our business growth.","259":"During the call, the company announced exciting news regarding upcoming services that will be available to our customers. [SEP] The other three services, the card is launching in August, the gaming service and the video service are starting in the fall. [SEP] We anticipate that these new services will drive significant growth and revenue in the coming quarters. Our team is working hard to ensure a smooth launch and we look forward to providing more updates as we get closer to release dates.","260":"Now moving on to our financial performance. I'd first like to discuss our Q1 revenue. Overall, we saw a strong quarter with total revenue reaching $10.2 billion. [SEP] So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is \u2013 the other revenue is, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are anticipating continued growth in other revenue as we expand our offerings and explore new opportunities. We will provide updates on our progress during future earnings calls. Thank you.","261":"Our Q2 earnings have been outstanding, and we are pleased to share them with you today. Our team has continued to remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives, and these results demonstrate the progress we have made. [SEP] Yes, as you noted in the press release or the 8-K, we had an absolute step-up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 billion. [SEP] Our revenue growth in Q2 was driven primarily by strong sales in our core businesses, as well as successful cost management strategies. We are confident that we will continue to build on this success in the coming quarters and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today.","262":"We've seen strong sales growth in our Apple ecosystem products this quarter. [SEP] A lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem, even though they might not currently use all the different products. [SEP] Our user research shows that customers appreciate the convenience and integration that comes from using multiple Apple products.","263":"In terms of our growth strategy, we believe that investing in technology is critical to our success. We're also looking to expand our reach in new markets and improve our customer service offerings. [SEP] We're continuing to invest in a number of key areas, hiring engineers to drive the three, five, and 10-year priorities. [SEP] While these investments may impact our short-term profitability, we believe they will yield significant benefits in the long run. We're already seeing positive results from our engineering hires, and we're confident that these investments will position us for even greater success in the years to come.","264":"During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our cloud services and Office 365 subscription-based productivity suite. [SEP] As I said in my remarks, I am very optimistic about what Windows 10 means for our customers, partners and Microsoft. [SEP] We've continued to invest in our gaming ecosystem, and are excited about the upcoming release of the Xbox Series X console. Overall, we're confident in our ability to drive growth across our key businesses.","265":"We are seeing a significant shift in the marketplace towards cloud computing. [SEP] And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10. [SEP] Our latest offering aims to make this transition even smoother for our clients, providing advanced security and data backup features.","266":"Can you speak to the supply chain situation for your different product segments? Are there any areas of concern or potential bottlenecks? [SEP] And what I would say is I think there we feel good about the supply in the Commercial segment and the Premium Consumer segment, which is where the vast majority of our revenue is in OEM. [SEP] However, we are keeping a close eye on the availability of certain materials and components, particularly in the aftermarket and accessories segments. We anticipate potential challenges in those areas but are working proactively to mitigate any supply chain disruptions.","267":"Moving on to our regional performance. While we delivered strong growth in the U.S. and Canada, we remained challenged in our European and rest of world markets. [SEP] Obviously, it's probably, everybody realizes this, but the big disparity between the U.S.-Canada growth rates versus the other regions like Europe and the rest of world are the currency headwinds, which had a very significant impact to the year-over-year advertising growth rates in those regions. [SEP] However, we continue to focus on diversifying our revenue streams and investing in local content to drive growth in those regions. We are confident in our ability to navigate these currency headwinds while also capitalizing on the numerous growth opportunities in our business.","268":"Our focus on user experience has been the driving force behind the success of App Store. [SEP] If you start with the user, what the App Store provides people is the best and safest place for users to get apps. [SEP] In the past quarter, App Store generated a record-breaking revenue of $22 billion, reflecting the trust and loyalty of our users towards our platform.","269":"Our commitment to innovation and improving our products has been a major focus for the company over the past year. [SEP] A good example of this is in fact even the rewrite of complete revamp I would say of Dynamics. [SEP] We believe that these improvements to Dynamics will better serve our customers and help drive growth for the company in the future.","270":"Our advertising strategy has been evolving constantly in response to changes in the market and technology. Over the past year, we've seen a shift in user behavior with more people spending time on social media and messaging apps. [SEP] We've had I think a lot of success moving advertisers to where people already are. [SEP] We believe this shift represents a key opportunity for us to drive revenue growth by monetizing these platforms. By moving advertisers to where people already are, we can better target our advertising and deliver more relevant content to users. We're confident that this strategy will continue to drive success in the future.","271":"Our Office 365 platform has been a key driver of our growth this quarter, with over 50% of our enterprise customers now using the product. We've seen increased demand for cloud-based solutions as more organizations transition to remote work models. [SEP] So when somebody moves to Office 365, their graph, their people, their relationships with other people inside the organization, their work artifacts all move to the cloud. [SEP] This migration to the cloud has also opened up opportunities for us to provide additional services, such as advanced analytics and machine learning. As more customers adopt our Office 365 platform, we expect to see continued growth in this area. We remain committed to investing in our cloud offerings to provide the best possible experience for our customers.","272":"Our team has been working hard to improve our ad solutions for small businesses. We believe that by providing more transparency and measurement capabilities, we can better serve our customers and help them grow their businesses. [SEP] From a small business perspective, being able to close the loop on ads and transactions, we think, is just going to make it so that it's more valuable to have a presence on our services, and buying ads is going to be more valuable. [SEP] In addition to improving our ad products, we are also investing in tools and resources to help small businesses succeed on our platform. For example, we recently launched a small business resource center that provides tips and best practices for using our advertising tools. We are committed to helping our customers succeed and believe that these efforts will drive long-term value for our business.","273":"During the quarter, the airline launched several new flight routes and added new aircraft to their fleet. [SEP] They had a goal of promoting their new flight routes, including one from Mumbai to Beijing, and their new aircraft. [SEP] As a result of their efforts, they were able to increase their market share in the Asia-Pacific region and experienced a 15% increase in overall revenue.","274":"We've seen significant growth in our various business lines over the past year. [SEP] What's I think interesting and strong about our potential business growth is that we're able to do this across these services. [SEP] Our continued investment in technology and innovation has allowed us to remain competitive in the market and expand our offerings.","275":"Our strategy for expanding into this new market has been progressing steadily over the last few quarters. We have been investing heavily in new resources, including hiring additional staff, developing new products, and building relationships with local suppliers. [SEP] And so we are still insignificantly in the build mode there, and so don't think of the penetration as anywhere near sort of a mature penetration. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about the potential for growth in this market. Our research indicates that there is still a large untapped opportunity for our products, and we will continue to invest in this region to capture that potential. We expect to see continued growth in the coming quarters as we ramp up our efforts and further establish our presence in this market.","276":"During this quarter, our focus has been on strengthening our commitment to privacy and data protection. [SEP] So we are investing a lot in privacy related to building the products and also working on complying with the FTC settlement. [SEP] In addition to this, we have also been closely monitoring the emerging regulations surrounding privacy and are committed to staying compliant with them.","277":"Now turning to our financial results for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] When you look at our revenue guidance, we are guiding to a sequential decline between 26% and 30%. [SEP] This decline is primarily due to a decrease in demand for our products and services in certain markets.","278":"We are thrilled to report our recent marketing campaign's success, which utilized a multichannel approach to reach our target audience. [SEP] They had a 16.5% lift in ad recall and then Nielsen\u2019s study showed a nearly 20% incremental reach on Facebook versus TV. [SEP] This data reinforces our belief in the effectiveness of social media advertising and encourages us to continue diversifying our ad spend.","279":"As we look to the future, there are a lot of exciting opportunities for growth in our industry. However, there are also some challenges that we need to address in order to capitalize on these opportunities. [SEP] And this impedance is something that I've always dreamt of how do we go forward. [SEP] I believe that addressing this impedance will be key to our success in the coming years, and I'm excited to work with our team to find innovative solutions. With the right approach, I'm confident that we can overcome this obstacle and continue to thrive as a company.","280":"We've had some questions about how we're thinking about the macro environment and specifically inflation and supply chain constraints. [SEP] However, I think you can tell from the numbers that Luca is talking about just on the currency side and that's before thinking through the affect that price increases can sometimes have on the business over a period of time, it's clear that the economic piece is large. [SEP] That said, we're confident in our ability to navigate through these challenges and continue to drive strong performance.","281":"So, looking ahead to the fourth quarter and the holiday season, what is your outlook on sales and revenue? [SEP] What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. [SEP] Our marketing team has been hard at work preparing for the busiest shopping time of the year and we've seen positive early indicators from our pre-holiday promotions.","282":"Now let's talk about our pricing strategy and margins for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] I would say the margins \u2013 our margins expectations are that we will price competitively and continue to pass along pricing reductions to customers both in the form of absolute price reductions and also in the form of new products that will in effect cannibalize the old ones. [SEP] We anticipate this approach will lead to a slight dip in short-term profits, but will ultimately solidify our position as a cost-conscious and innovative leader in the market.","283":"When asked about the growth potential of AWS, the company's CEO responded [SEP] It's not only dependent on us, it's also dependent on the companies that are adopting Amazon, so there's a - or excuse me, AWS. [SEP] But we certainly believe that our continued investment in AWS, and the increasing demand for cloud services in general, positions us well for continued growth in this area.","284":"We've been testing this new feature in a few select markets over the past few months. [SEP] And similarly, based on the feedback that we're getting, I would expect that we'll be rolling that out pretty widely across the world soon as well. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to monitor user engagement and feedback as we roll out this feature globally.","285":"Our international expansion efforts have been successful, particularly in China where we continue to see strong growth. [SEP] This is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese-language pages. [SEP] We are constantly looking for ways to improve the customer experience and expand our global reach, and this offer has been very well-received by our Chinese customers.","286":"We're now going to open the call up to questions from analysts. The first question comes from John Smith at ABC Bank. John, please go ahead.\"\n\n\"Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I had a question about the transformation you just mentioned. Could you give us some more detail on what's driving that, and what kind of progress you're making? [SEP] Overall, the approach we have taken for multiple years now is to transform everything that we do inside the company, whether it\u2019s the product creation, how we\u2019re organized in the R&D, how we think about breaking down any silos and category definitions we may have had in the past, how we think about even marketing and the marketing approach, and then of course even with the go to market, and this transformation is ongoing. [SEP] Sure, John. Thanks for the question. This transformation is really driven by a few things. First, we're seeing a lot of disruption in our industry, with new competitors emerging and customer needs evolving rapidly. We need to be agile and flexible to respond to those challenges.\"\n\n\"Second, we believe there are a lot of opportunities to improve the way we operate internally, and to create a more cohesive and collaborative culture across the company. That's why we're breaking down silos and rethinking how we approach everything from R&D to marketing.\"\n\n\"Third, we want to be more customer-focused in everything we do. By transforming our approach, we believe we can better understand what our customers need and how best to serve them. It's an ongoing process, but we're already seeing some positive results in terms of innovation, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.","287":"Our website traffic has seen consistent growth over the past quarter. [SEP] I think we have been and continue to be a great place for people to browse and discover. [SEP] We are exploring new partnerships and initiatives to enhance the browsing experience for our customers.","288":"Our strategy has always been to offer a premium console alongside a more affordable option to increase our market share. [SEP] because we always wanted that halo effect of the premium console driving even the lower-end console, because that creates the sockets for gaming for us. [SEP] And, we've seen that the success of our premium console has indeed driven sales of our lower-end console, which is great news for us.","289":"When discussing our iPhone sales for the quarter, I also want to address the pricing of our devices. [SEP] And we've tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone but may have a more limited budget. [SEP] We believe that everyone should have access to the best technology, and we will continue to work towards making our products more accessible to a wider audience.","290":"We have received a lot of inquiries from investors and analysts about the potential for more advertising in our Video product. [SEP] On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose not to do that right now. [SEP] Our focus right now is on improving the user experience and increasing engagement, and we believe that flooding our Video product with ads would be counterproductive to those goals.","291":"Our sales for this quarter have exceeded expectations. [SEP] We think we have \u2013 we're attractive both to customers and to sellers and we like our position. [SEP] We are constantly looking for ways to improve our platform and enhance the experience for both our customers and sellers.","292":"During the last quarter, we launched a new product line hoping to attract a wider audience and diversify our revenue streams. [SEP] And we got a lot of feedback from people saying that's not what they wanted. [SEP] As a result, we decided to pivot our strategy and focus on developing a more targeted solution that addresses our customers' specific needs.","293":"In order to improve our delivery times and efficiency, we've made several investments in our infrastructure. [SEP] It's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network. [SEP] The result has been a significant reduction in shipping times and an increase in customer satisfaction.","294":"Our advertising revenue grew by 25% year-over-year, driven by increased engagement across our platforms and growth in the number of advertisers. [SEP] And so as we work on rolling out more Ad Breaks, and we are rolling out slowly, we're really focused on finding ways to help marketers measure the right things, and that's a very important focus for the company going forward. [SEP] We're also continuing to invest in improving the user experience, balancing the needs of advertisers with providing value to our community.","295":"We noticed a slight fluctuation in our revenue this quarter. Can you explain what may have caused this? [SEP] There\u2019s a couple of things, but in general it is almost always mix shift. [SEP] Can you provide some specific examples of mix shift impacting our earnings this quarter?","296":"In Q2, we made some significant updates to our platform to better serve our publisher partners. We added new features for ad targeting and improved our reporting capabilities. [SEP] What we're hearing from publishers is that this is a good opportunity and they're pleased with the extensions we're making [SEP] As a result of our efforts, we've seen an increase in the number of publishers joining our network. We're confident that these extensions will continue to benefit both our publishers and advertisers alike.","297":"Now, let's turn our attention to the growth in our core platform. [SEP] So we're continuing to see good growth in the Facebook ecosystem with 11% DAU growth. [SEP] This growth is largely due to the introduction of new features and products, as well as increased user engagement across all demographics.","298":"As we look ahead to the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond, I wanted to touch on our plans for investment. We believe that by investing in key areas of our business, we can position ourselves for sustainable, long-term growth. [SEP] And so the net is we\u2019re investing a lot across the board in our infrastructure, in our products, on partnering with different companies. [SEP] We're also focused on optimizing our operations to ensure that we're using resources as efficiently as possible. This includes exploring new technologies and operational processes that can streamline our workflows and reduce costs. Overall, we're confident that these investments will pay off in the form of stronger revenue growth and increased profitability over the long term.","299":"Our company has seen significant growth over the past year, driven by our focus on expanding our higher-level services. [SEP] And so we're very bullish about what can happen in the higher-level services and we'll continue to build on that piece. [SEP] We're also exploring new partnerships and acquisitions to further strengthen our position in this area.","300":"We've seen steady growth in our grocery business over the past year, and that's largely due to our acquisition of Whole Foods. We made significant investments in their operations and marketing, and we're starting to see the benefits of that work. [SEP] So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. [SEP] However, we know that the grocery industry is highly competitive, and we're not resting on our laurels. We're continuing to innovate and improve our offerings, both in-store and online, to stay ahead of the game. We're confident that our partnership with Whole Foods will be a key driver of growth for years to come.","301":"Our Q3 results showed strong improvement compared to the previous quarter, with sequential gains of 800 basis points. This was largely due to the impact of our recent cost-cutting measures and increased demand for our products. [SEP] And so we are lapping that, which sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis points sequential gain. [SEP] Looking ahead to Q4, we anticipate a more moderate rate of growth as we continue to navigate challenges related to the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. However, we remain optimistic about our long-term prospects and are committed to investing in innovation and strategic partnerships to drive continued success.","302":"Now, let's take a closer look at our sales performance over the past few quarters. [SEP] We're really pleased with that and if you look at the sort of the cycle, which I'll define as Q1, Q2, Q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid single digits and on an average weekly sales point of view, and of course double digit on the ASP and so I think it's really healthy. [SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to focus on driving growth through strategic marketing initiatives and product innovation.","303":"Looking at our Q2 revenue, we brought in $1.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year. [SEP] And keep in mind that this $99 was partially offset by $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange. [SEP] However, our earnings per share came in at $0.85, which is below our guidance due to the aforementioned foreign exchange impact and some supply chain disruptions.","304":"In terms of our e-commerce business, we continue to see strong growth in our marketplace and Prime offerings. [SEP] FBA becomes very important as well and we've talked about some of the tailwinds we see there, and sort of the linkage between marketplace and Prime that FBA provides. [SEP] We're also investing heavily in fulfillment infrastructure to keep up with the demand for FBA, and we believe this will continue to drive growth in our e-commerce segment.","305":"We've seen great success in our advertising campaigns over the past quarter, especially in terms of driving sales. Our team has been working hard to create engaging and impactful ads that resonate with our target audience. [SEP] Obviously, if people learn about things through our ads and then close the loop all the way to purchase, it's very strong for proving ROI, it also helps as a measure that return as well. [SEP] We're looking forward to continuing to refine our advertising strategy and measure the impact of our efforts on the bottom line. Our team is committed to delivering value to our customers and shareholders, and we believe that our advertising campaigns are an important part of that equation.","306":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith with ABC Capital. John, you may go ahead with your question.\n\nJohn:\n\nYes, thank you. I was wondering if you could expand a bit on your video offerings. What kind of opportunities do you see there? [SEP] So I think excited about that, other opportunities we've been working with in ads, video for a bit longer period of time have been things like our sports offering, some of the live sports that we've done, things like Thursday Night Football, really like the success that we've seen on those and been learning from that and looking forward to pursuing more opportunities to engage and serve with customers with those types of video offers, but also take some opportunity to monetize with the advertising. [SEP] Bob:\n\nThanks for the question, John. Yes, we're definitely seeing some exciting opportunities in video. One area that's been particularly successful has been our sports offering. We've had some great results with live sports events, such as Thursday Night Football, and we're looking to build on that success with more engaging video content. And of course, we see a lot of potential for advertising revenue in this area as well, so we're eager to explore those opportunities further.","307":"Our goal is to continue to innovate and offer our users new and exciting ways to engage with our platform. [SEP] Over the longer term, I think as that works, people will experiment with longer forms of video as well and all kinds of different things. [SEP] We're also excited to explore advertising opportunities within these longer forms of video content.","308":"Our production team has been working tirelessly to increase our output and meet the high demand for our products. We've invested in new machinery and streamlined our processes to make this possible. [SEP] And so we're really happy that we were able to increase week by week what we're outputting and we're going to get as many of them as possible to the customers as soon as possible. [SEP] We've also implemented new safety protocols to ensure the well-being of our team members during these challenging times. We believe that our commitment to quality and customer satisfaction will continue to drive our success in the coming quarters. Thank you for your continued support.","309":"Our cloud services segment saw strong growth this quarter, driven primarily by our Azure platform. [SEP] And we did have some large Azure contracts which tend to be longer dated and tend to have low billings upfront. [SEP] However, we continue to see strong demand for Azure from enterprise customers and expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","310":"Our latest marketing campaign has been met with some mixed results, but we're optimistic about its potential. We've had some initial success in terms of increased website traffic and social media engagement, but we're eager to see if this translates into actual sales. [SEP] And right now, we're using the Lift tool to continue to measure their sales for the 30 and 60 days beyond the campaign to see what happens. [SEP] Of course, it's still early days, and we know that there are always a lot of variables at play when it comes to marketing. Regardless of the final outcome, though, we believe that it's important to stay on top of our data and use it to inform our decision-making going forward. We're excited to continue exploring the possibilities of the Lift tool, and we're confident that it will help us make more informed and effective marketing choices in the future.","311":"We're really focused on outcomes and results. And the time spent is simply a means to achieve those ends. [SEP] That's why I tried to stress up front that time spent is not a goal by itself here. [SEP] So, as we move forward, I just want to make sure everyone understands that we're not trying to be busy for the sake of being busy. We're trying to be productive and efficient in everything we do. And if that means we can get the same results in less time, that's great. Our ultimate goal is to deliver value and make a positive impact for our customers and our stakeholders.","312":"Our overall sales performance for the quarter was strong. [SEP] And traffic \u2013 which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell \u2013 traffic was up 27% year on year. [SEP] We believe this increase in traffic is due to the successful implementation of our new marketing campaigns and promotions.","313":"We've seen a significant increase in our device trade-in program over the past quarter. [SEP] Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the -- many, many people do want to trade-in their current phone. [SEP] In fact, we've had to allocate more resources to handle the influx of trade-ins, but it's a positive sign that our customers trust us to provide them with the latest technology.","314":"Our team has been closely monitoring our platform's user engagement metrics throughout the quarter. [SEP] I think in terms of impression growth, you're going to have more opportunities in Stories, probably more opportunity on Instagram, but good revenue growth opportunities in both places. [SEP] With these projections in mind, we're confident in our ability to continue driving value for both our users and our shareholders in the coming months.","315":"Now moving on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] On the advertising business, or rather I should say other revenue that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. [SEP] This growth was largely driven by our latest product launches and continued expansion into new markets.","316":"We're really excited about the growth potential that we've been seeing across our portfolio of apps. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger all helped to drive our Q2 results with strong momentum in advertising revenue. [SEP] And in the mid-term, we're building out those next-generation of services to be great businesses that reach their full potential, so that's Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger. [SEP] We believe that these next-gen services will continue to drive growth for us, and we're investing in them accordingly. This means building out new features, investing in marketing and sales, and continuing to innovate across all of our platforms. We're confident that Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger are well-positioned for long-term success and will be key drivers of our future growth.","317":"We are really focused on enhancing the user experience and finding new ways to engage with our audience. [SEP] And more of these augmented reality tools I think are going to be an important part of delivering that experience to making that fun to use and expressive as it can be. [SEP] We've had a lot of positive feedback from users who have tried our latest augmented reality feature and we're excited to continue exploring this technology.","318":"As we continue to focus on improving the user experience on our platform, we're constantly evaluating the effectiveness of our advertising. We believe that delivering relevant ads is key to driving engagement and ultimately revenue growth for our business. [SEP] If you look at what percentage of our ads are truly relevant to the people who are seeing them, I think we've done a lot better over the last couple of years, but we have a long way to go. [SEP] We're investing heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning to help us better target our ads to the right audiences. We're also working closely with our partners to ensure that the ads they create for our platform are of the highest quality. We're confident that with these efforts, we'll be able to continue improving the relevance of our ads and delivering strong results for our advertisers.","319":"Now let's turn our attention to the expense side of things. [SEP] So if you recall, it's very consistent with what we've been talking about the last couple of quarters which is the acceleration of expense growth is really driven by three factors. [SEP] But we are confident in our ability to manage and control these expenses going forward.","320":"Now I'd like to turn to our Office 365 product. We are very pleased with the performance of this segment and the growth it continues to deliver. [SEP] In terms of overall reach of Office 365, we continue to see significant opportunity going forward on multiple dimensions. [SEP] Our team is actively working on expanding the international presence of Office 365 and we believe there is room for further expansion in emerging markets. Additionally, we are exploring new features and functionality to enhance the user experience and drive adoption of the platform.","321":"We saw a significant increase in our advertising revenue this quarter. [SEP] But rather than just run one ad, they were able to run five based on the interest base and personality targeting that really only we can do. [SEP] This targeted approach has proven to be very successful in driving conversions and increasing engagement.","322":"During this quarter, we have been focusing on expanding our business operations into new territories and investing in innovative technologies. As a result of these efforts, we have seen a steady increase in our revenue and a significant improvement in our operational efficiency. [SEP] Now, that being said, I am pleased obviously, to be able to access the cash more easily and not has to go through the debt market to be able to make these choices [SEP] This gives us the flexibility to pursue new growth opportunities and make strategic acquisitions that will further enhance our market position. Overall, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of the company and are committed to delivering value to our shareholders in the long-term. Thank you all for your attention, and we look forward to sharing more updates with you in the upcoming quarters.","323":"Our team has been closely monitoring the recent software updates and we are excited to share our findings with you all. [SEP] We've gotten with iOS 9, there's some incredible productivity enhancements coming in with split view and slide over and picture-in-picture. [SEP] These features not only improve the user experience but also provide valuable opportunities for our business to innovate and offer new products.","324":"I understand that there may be concerns about how the current market conditions will affect our business. However, I want to reassure our shareholders that we have a solid strategy in place to navigate these challenging times. [SEP] All of this said, we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out [SEP] We have a dedicated team working to mitigate any potential risks and capitalize on new opportunities. Additionally, we continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. With that in mind, all things considered, we remain positive about the future of our company.","325":"Our social media advertising strategy has been really effective this quarter [SEP] So what we're seeing is the results we're able to deliver on Facebook and Instagram, a lot of our marketing partners want more. [SEP] We're starting to explore options for expanding our social media ad reach even further to meet this growing demand.","326":"We've had a lot of success with our recent marketing campaigns. [SEP] That has obviously helped a lot with the growth in the number of paid accounts. [SEP] Additionally, we've seen a surge in interest from international markets, which has also boosted our paid account numbers.","327":"We have noticed some concerns regarding our supply chain and inventory management in certain locations. [SEP] I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers. [SEP] In response, we have implemented new strategies and technologies to improve our ordering and stocking processes to ensure a consistent and reliable shopping experience for our customers.","328":"We've received a lot of questions about the upgrade rate for our latest iPhone model. [SEP] However, if you look at it from an upgrade rate point of view instead of the absolute number, the rate is similar to what we saw with the previous iPhones, except for iPhone 6, which as we called out in the past had an abnormally high upgrade rate. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with the response to the new iPhone and expect the upgrade rate to continue in line with historical trends.","329":"Investor: \"Can you give us any insight into whether or not the company's revenue will increase next quarter?\"\n- CEO: \"It's difficult to say for certain, but I have some optimism about our prospects. [SEP] I\u2019m not sure precisely when, but I\u2019m pretty confident that it will. [SEP] CFO: \"We're seeing some positive trends in the market that could help us achieve our goals.\"\n- CEO: \"And we're working hard to develop some new product offerings that we think will resonate with consumers.","330":"Can you give us an update on how much you're spending on research and development this quarter? [SEP] Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation pace continues to accelerate. [SEP] We're really excited about some of the new products and services we have in development that we believe will have a big impact on the market.","331":"We have seen a steady increase in demand for our products in the past quarter. [SEP] Some people hold onto those for the life of the product and some people trade them in. [SEP] However, we have also noticed a slight decrease in the number of customers who choose to trade in their products.","332":"In terms of our growth strategy, we're looking to expand our offerings to cover a wider range of technologies. Our goal is to become a one-stop-shop for all our customers' needs. [SEP] The architectural design we have for example when we do X we are buying the four everything that Microsoft does which is everything from Azure to Office 3652 Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services like Xbox live. [SEP] By acquiring these various solutions, we believe we can not only increase our revenue streams, but also provide a more comprehensive experience for our clients. Plus, having access to Microsoft's top-of-the-line offerings will give us a competitive edge in the market.","333":"We are now going to shift our focus to discuss our progress in the enterprise segment. As you all know, this has been a key area of growth for us in recent years, and we believe there is still huge potential for us in this market. [SEP] It's about the selling motion of E3 and E5 that we talk about. [SEP] We have been working hard on improving our selling motion for these products in particular, as we believe there is significant demand from our enterprise customers. Our sales team have been putting in a lot of effort to ensure that our message is being communicated clearly and effectively to these customers, and we are starting to see some promising results. \n\nOverall, we remain confident in the long-term prospects for our enterprise business, and we will continue to focus on delivering products and services that meet the evolving needs of our customers in this space.","334":"We are seeing strong demand for our products and services, and we expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters. Our revenue growth has been solid, and we are confident in our ability to maintain this trajectory. [SEP] At the same time, we don't want to underinvest in the business. [SEP] To ensure that we continue to capitalize on these opportunities, we will be investing heavily in research and development, as well as increasing our marketing spend. However, we are being cautious about managing our costs and will only invest in areas where we see promising returns.","335":"And speaking of our video streaming service, let's talk about how we use data to continually improve our content offerings. [SEP] And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections. [SEP] This targeted approach has led to a significant increase in engagement and conversion rates among our Prime members, and we plan to continue utilizing this data-driven strategy moving forward.","336":"We are closely monitoring global demographic trends as they could significantly impact our long-term growth strategy. [SEP] I think it's clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. [SEP] With this in mind, we are exploring ways to expand our operations in India to capitalize on this demographic shift.","337":"Can you give us some insight into the current state of demand for your services? [SEP] Overall, I think some of the trends that you've referenced, whether it's Tier 1 workloads or serverless or even complete data center migrations, all of that is happening. [SEP] That's great to hear. Can you talk a bit more about how your company is positioning itself to capture these opportunities?\" \n\nOverall, I think some of the trends that you've referenced, whether it's Tier 1 workloads or serverless or even complete data center migrations, all of that is happening. We're seeing an increasing interest in cloud technologies from both large enterprises and small businesses alike, and we've been working hard to ensure we're well-positioned to meet this demand. With our recent investments in our infrastructure and our partnerships with leading cloud providers, we believe we're well-equipped to capture these opportunities and continue driving growth for our business.","338":"Our mobile hotspot device sales continue to exceed expectations. [SEP] And because it allows the mobile carriers to not have to have the whole supply chain and sales and retail that they have otherwise, they're able to sell the data plans for on average about 10% less than they would be able to otherwise, which actually is allowing more people to get on the internet in the first place because they can now afford data plans. [SEP] We anticipate further growth in this area as more people seek affordable internet access options.","339":"We're constantly investing in our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities,\" said the CEO during the earnings call. [SEP] Similarly, aside from the conversational and linguistic understanding, there's a whole thread of the work that we're doing on visual understanding. [SEP] This has allowed us to improve our product recommendations and personalization features, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention,\" added the chief technology officer.","340":"We have been closely analyzing market trends and customer preferences to identify new opportunities. [SEP] And so therefore, we look at that as an expansion opportunity, so we take that. [SEP] We are confident that investing in this expansion will not only increase our market share but also drive long-term growth for the company.","341":"Thank you for joining us today on our earnings conference call. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for our company, and I'd like to take this opportunity to share some of the highlights and key takeaways. [SEP] All of these have been multiple years of hard work, and clearly there is momentum across the board, and that I think is what you are seeing and we are excited about this quarter's execution and performance, and I think it bodes well for what we do in the future, but the key is for us to recognize that this is about the sort of long-term commitment to a big opportunity in making sure that you line up your execution against that. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to position ourselves for success in the coming years. We believe that we are well-equipped to capitalize on emerging trends and leverage our core competencies to drive sustainable growth. As always, we remain focused on creating value for our shareholders, customers, and employees, and we are grateful for your continued support. Thank you.","342":"We recently received some concerning feedback from our customers about a particular product feature. It was not until we conducted a study on the matter that we realized there was indeed an issue. [SEP] When that study was shared with people internally, and we have that culture where people do studies and share things, and we're really glad because that helps surface issues, we immediately conducted our own research using the full data. [SEP] The results from our study showed the same thing as the external study. We quickly came together as a team to brainstorm solutions and implement a plan of action. Ultimately, this experience has strengthened our commitment to our customers and our culture of transparency and continuous improvement.","343":"We recognize the importance of providing a safe and positive experience for our users on Facebook. As part of our efforts to improve this experience, we have been closely monitoring and addressing the issue of objectionable content on our platform. [SEP] So there's an increasing focus on objectionable content, right, and a lot of unfortunate things, right, that people share on Facebook. [SEP] To address this problem, we have been investing heavily in both human and technological resources to detect and remove inappropriate content. We also work closely with law enforcement authorities and other organizations to ensure that our platform is not used for unlawful activities. We are committed to maintaining a high level of integrity and responsibility in the use of our platform, and we will continue to develop new strategies to make Facebook a safe and enjoyable space for all our users.","344":"We are pleased to report record-breaking revenue for the past quarter. [SEP] With Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, Band 2 and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL. [SEP] We continue to see strong demand for our products and are optimistic about their future performance in the market.","345":"We are pleased to report another successful quarter for our company. [SEP] As you think about commercial intent in Facebook versus Instagram, there's so much activity on both. [SEP] Our teams have been working hard to build upon this success and continue to explore opportunities for growth in both platforms.","346":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. We're excited to discuss our performance this quarter and our strategy moving forward. [SEP] I think broadly, when we look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories, so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. [SEP] Additionally, we're committed to enhancing the customer experience through seamless checkout, fast shipping, and exceptional customer service. We believe that by prioritizing these key areas, we will continue to attract and retain loyal customers and drive sustainable growth.","347":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in user activity on our platform. [SEP] And the reason we think people are so active is it's just really expensive and hard to have your own mobile site or your own even webpage. [SEP] We believe that by providing businesses with an affordable and easy-to-use platform, we can continue to attract and retain active users.","348":"Can you talk more about your cloud strategy and how you're integrating different products and services under one umbrella? [SEP] When you look at what we're trying to get done between Azure, we don't really see these themes across Azure or 365, Dynamics 365, and also the things that we're doing with Xbox Live, for example, all billed as one cloud infrastructure and a set of rich services in the cloud. [SEP] Can you elaborate on how this approach is benefiting your customers and driving growth for the company?","349":"As we reflect on our first quarter performance, I want to address any concerns about the launch of our new product line. [SEP] In the first quarter with any new kind of product, you would always have learning and these sorts of things. [SEP] Despite some initial setbacks, we have already implemented several changes to improve customer satisfaction and are confident in our future success with this product.","350":"Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of John Smith from XYZ Investment Bank. [SEP] Just on the OpEx question, I think the key is that we're investing in our near, mid-term, and long-term priorities, so while we expect some near-term pressure on margins, we're confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth and profitability over the long run. [SEP] We're seeing strong demand for our products and solutions across all of our markets, and we remain committed to investing in innovation, technology, and our people to drive continued success.","351":"Our second quarter results have shown strong growth across all aspects of our business. We're particularly pleased with the success of our subscription services. [SEP] iCloud is a service that continues to grow very strong double digits, and that's also helping. [SEP] We expect iCloud to continue to drive growth in the coming quarters as more and more users choose to store their photos, documents, and other files in the cloud. Additionally, we're working on new features and enhancements to make iCloud even more valuable to our customers.","352":"We now have some updates on this matter. [SEP] Just on the second question on the subscription services, we\u2019d said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018. [SEP] As we move into 2019, we have seen a positive impact from these changes and expect continued growth in our subscription services.","353":"We have been discussing the company\u2019s financial position and our plans for growth. [SEP] That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint. [SEP] I believe we can find ways to optimize our expenses and continue investing in our strategic objectives.","354":"Looking ahead, I think there are some positive factors that will benefit our industry. Firstly, there's been a lot of discussion lately around the need for increased investment in infrastructure. Secondly, we've seen some improvements in the job market, and consumer confidence is starting to pick up. [SEP] I also think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure and on creating jobs, which is fantastic [SEP] Overall, I believe that these trends will support continued growth in our business over the coming months. However, we also need to be cautious and remain vigilant about the potential impact of any changes in government policy or macroeconomic conditions. We'll continue to closely monitor these developments and adjust our strategy as needed to ensure we remain on track to deliver value to our shareholders.","355":"During the quarter, we faced challenges with supply chain disruptions and increased competition in certain markets. [SEP] So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our retail segment and are exploring new opportunities for expansion into international markets.","356":"Moving on to our gaming segment, I'd like to highlight some of the key developments that have been taking place in the industry over the past few years. [SEP] I would say from a Gaming perspective, one of the bigger changes that has happened in the last, I would say, couple of years is one, of course the vibrancy of the Xbox Live network across the PC and the console and now increasingly even on the phone because of titles like Minecraft. [SEP] This has really opened up new opportunities for us, as we explore ways to leverage this network to drive engagement and revenue across our portfolio of games. Overall, we're very optimistic about the gaming market and see a lot of potential for growth in the years ahead.","357":"Now, let's talk about our financial performance over the past quarter. [SEP] Q4 was a little depressed is how as we think about it due to some of the restructuring; Q1 is a little bit higher. [SEP] However, overall, we are optimistic about the year ahead and believe that our strategic initiatives will lead to sustained growth in the long-term.","358":"Can you expand on how you view the adoption of this technology within the industry? [SEP] But I think broadly, I don't see any difference than say, what we used to see or what we still see on our server or any other technology adoption curves. [SEP] So you're confident in the growth potential of this technology?","359":"Our user base continues to grow at a steady pace, and we're seeing more and more engagement on our platform. [SEP] and we think that's very promising for our ability for people to use this platform to make those connections that will ultimately drive business opportunities. [SEP] In addition, we're actively exploring new partnerships and integrations that will further enhance the value of our platform for users.","360":"We have seen a shift in consumer behavior over the past quarter. [SEP] And as I mentioned, it\u2019s one of the factors driving an increasing inventory. [SEP] However, we anticipate a decrease in inventory once these new products are launched and consumer demand picks up.","361":"Our revenue growth this quarter was driven by several key segments, including... [SEP] Direct response, SMBs who have uploaded 1.5 million videos and have both organic and paid in the last month, and developers. [SEP] We see tremendous potential for continued growth in these areas, and are actively investing in resources and partnerships to support these customers. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our ability to maintain this momentum and deliver strong results for our shareholders.","362":"Now, let's delve deeper into some of the user engagement metrics we saw during the quarter. [SEP] Pages are engaging in this, and some of the trends that Dave just talked about for just a lot of video behavior across the platform. [SEP] As a company, we're committed to staying at the forefront of these trends and delivering the best possible user experience on our platform.","363":"Our Q3 financial results exceeded expectations and we're excited to share some updates on our upcoming initiatives. [SEP] We\u2019ve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, we\u2019re looking forward to our re:Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees. [SEP] Additionally, our team is working hard to innovate on behalf of our customers and we anticipate continued growth and success in the coming year.","364":"Next, I'd like to touch on some of our recent developments in the product line. [SEP] There is a second experience called Video Home, which we started talking about earlier in the year. [SEP] We've seen strong interest in Video Home from customers, particularly those looking for a more immersive viewing experience.","365":"We've seen significant growth in the adoption of our new product offerings over the past quarter. Our team has been working tirelessly to improve our technology and better communicate the benefits to our customers. [SEP] But they became much more pervasive and much communicated, I think much wider with the September announcements. [SEP] As we continue to expand our reach and improve our products, we expect to see even greater uptake in the coming months. Our innovative approach to the market is resonating with customers, and we're confident in our ability to deliver strong results going forward.","366":"We know that people come to Facebook not just to connect with friends and family, but also to find and engage with communities that share their interests. [SEP] Hundreds of millions of people already tell us that the groups that they're a part of on Facebook or at least a few meaningful ones are the most important part of their social experience. [SEP] And as we continue to invest in building tools for these communities, we're seeing incredible engagement and growth in group participation on our platform.","367":"Now I'd like to turn the discussion to our e-commerce business. As you all know, we've had significant growth in this segment over the past few years. [SEP] Certainly one of the things that we've talked about its most, that\u2019s notable is fulfillment by Amazon. [SEP] We've seen tremendous success with this program, particularly with Prime members. We plan to continue to invest in and expand our fulfillment network to support this growth.","368":"Our company has been closely monitoring global markets and consumer behavior to identify and respond to trends. [SEP] I had mentioned Japan, but also even in this country even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time. [SEP] However, we have seen a resilience in demand for our products and we remain optimistic about our future growth prospects.","369":"We've noticed a decline in revenue per license (RPL) for non-Pro original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). [SEP] And so overall while it did have an RPL impact, which does explain along with mix shift, the minus 13% in non-Pro OEM versus the PC license growth that we saw, I think really Satya covered the actual logic to that in terms of overall ecosystem health as we feel quite good about. [SEP] We're confident that our continued focus on ensuring a healthy ecosystem will result in long-term success for our company.","370":"Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we anticipate some challenges as we navigate the current economic climate. Our team has been working diligently to mitigate potential risks and capitalize on opportunities. [SEP] But at this point in time, we see that Q2 is the toughest compare. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our strategy and the strength of our products. We will continue to focus on driving growth and delivering value to our customers.","371":"We have seen significant growth in our customer base this quarter, with a 25% increase in new sign-ups compared to the same period last year. [SEP] And we think it's a combination of all these offerings that really are the strength of our business and explains why we can continue to grow. [SEP] In addition, we are continually investing in research and development to enhance our products and services, and we are confident that we can sustain our growth trajectory for the foreseeable future.","372":"We have seen strong growth across all our business segments this quarter. [SEP] But in general, my view is very positive in terms of how things are going, and that positive view is obviously factored in our guidance as well. [SEP] We continue to invest in new technologies and innovations to further drive our growth in the upcoming quarters.","373":"We've been really focused on understanding our users better and creating a more personalized experience. One of the challenges we've encountered is that many analytics tools make assumptions about how users behave online. [SEP] They basically assume that you are one person on one of device, and we know that's not true. [SEP] That's why we've invested heavily in developing our own data infrastructure and analytics capabilities. We want to be able to accurately track user interactions across all devices and channels. By doing so, we can create a more holistic view of our users and make better decisions about how to engage with them.","374":"We\u2019ve seen steady growth in sales throughout the year, with a particularly strong showing during the holiday season. [SEP] It\u2019s a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth and holiday season, that\u2019s very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in sales as we expand our product offerings and continue to attract new customers.","375":"I want to take a moment to address concerns about the security of our platform. As you all know, data privacy and security have been hot topics in the tech industry. I want to assure our investors and users that we have taken significant steps to ensure the safety of our platform. [SEP] And in each of these \u2013 going back to 2016, we were \u2013 we have a very big security team that was focused on security around even the 2016 election and we found hacking and phishing attacks that the Russian government was trying to do, and we notified the right people about those. [SEP] Since then, we have continued to invest heavily in our security infrastructure and technologies. We have implemented advanced threat detection systems and increased our collaboration with law enforcement agencies and security experts. As a result, we have been able to prevent numerous attempts to compromise our systems and protect our users' data.","376":"We often coordinate with our sister company on certain projects and initiatives. [SEP] But as you say they're separately run and they can meet at different points and sometimes at certain vendors perhaps that may get out of hand are get out of sync. [SEP] However, we are aware of the potential for miscommunication or misunderstandings between the two companies. We have implemented measures to ensure that communication channels are clear and both teams are aligned.","377":"We are really pleased with the progress we've made so far in terms of the new product development. We're tracking well against our timelines and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. [SEP] And then the next stage after that which is really the enterprise deployment, which as Satya mentioned, we expect in the second half of the year. [SEP] This enterprise deployment is a key milestone for us and we believe it will generate significant growth in the coming years. We're already seeing strong interest from our customers and we're working closely with them to ensure a smooth transition. Overall, we're confident about our prospects for the second half of the year and beyond.","378":"We've seen some great success in certain regional markets that we've been targeting in recent months. [SEP] Those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and the 6 Plus, because of the screen size, is doing extremely well. [SEP] As we continue to build momentum in these areas, we're optimistic about seeing continued strong growth for our devices in the coming quarters.","379":"Now, let's talk about our recent advancements in Managed Services. [SEP] And even take something like EMS, which is a service you could say in the past we participated with Active Directory, but we, and some amount of system center. [SEP] But today, with the emergence of Azure Resource Manager, we can provide customers with a much more streamlined and effective solution for managing their EMS environments.","380":"We've been steadily expanding our operations over the past year, and I'm pleased to report that we're making great progress towards our goal. [SEP] It's not that we're going to crack every market at once, but in sum I think we're definitely getting there. [SEP] Of course, we still have a long way to go, and there are certainly going to be bumps on the road ahead. But overall, I'm confident that we're on the right track.","381":"Our strategy for growing our subscriber base continues to be successful. [SEP] But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new ways to enhance the value of the Prime membership, such as exclusive access to live events and premium customer service.","382":"Our efforts to educate our customers about the benefits of our new product and our sales team's hard work have contributed to this growth. [SEP] So that shows real growth people understanding they need to do it differently, but we\u2019ve still got a pretty long way to go, and we are seeing good results. [SEP] However, we must continue to stay vigilant and identify areas where we can improve to sustain this growth in the long term.","383":"We've seen great success with our international expansion efforts in the past year. Our presence in Europe and Asia has been particularly strong. [SEP] It's growing faster outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S. [SEP] We plan to continue investing in our global markets as we see significant growth potential there. In fact, we anticipate that our international revenue will surpass our U.S. revenue within the next two years.","384":"We received a lot of questions in the Q&A portion of our last earnings call about our infrastructure strategy. Today, I wanted to provide an update on our thinking around this area. [SEP] And then in terms of infrastructure itself, as again I said, there's people who are tiering, even applications people who build hybrid applications where the storage could be even on premise in some cases, but the mid-tier and the web and the mobile back ends are in the cloud. [SEP] We believe this hybrid approach is the best way to balance the advantages of cloud computing with the security and control that comes with keeping some data on-premise. We plan to continue investing in infrastructure that supports this hybrid model and delivers the best possible user experience for our customers.","385":"Our video advertising platform has been gaining traction with small and medium businesses all over the world. We have seen a significant increase in the number of businesses using our platform in the past year. [SEP] Over 1 million SMBs have posted videos and done really small ad buys around them. [SEP] This is a testament to the effectiveness of our video advertising platform in helping SMBs grow their businesses. We will continue to improve our platform to meet the evolving needs of our customers and stay ahead of the competition.","386":"We have received feedback from our customers that our tools could be more user-friendly. [SEP] I mean, I think as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of tools. [SEP] This is a priority for us as we want to make sure our customers have the best experience possible when using our platform.","387":"Looking ahead to next quarter, we are expecting some changes in our market and customer base. [SEP] I tend to think about that as we'll have significant revenue growth in that segment. [SEP] Of course, there are always risks and uncertainties in any market, but we feel confident in our strategy and our team's abilities to navigate them.","388":"Now, let's turn to our product performance and market share. [SEP] And compared to the industry peers, we're obviously gaining share with Windows Server, on SQL Server, and pretty much all of our management and security products as well. [SEP] We believe this is a clear reflection of our focus on innovation and meeting the evolving needs of our customers.","389":"We've seen a significant increase in our video ad revenue this quarter. [SEP] But as consumer engagement with video has continued to grow, that creates more and more of an opportunity for video ads. [SEP] In fact, our research shows that consumers are more likely to retain and recall information from video ads compared to other forms of advertising.","390":"During the past quarter, we've seen some incredible growth in our smartphone division. Our flagship product, the iPhone X, continues to be one of our best sellers. [SEP] And so it's iPhone X was number one, but we had several in the top. [SEP] Our research and development team is working feverishly on new innovations that we believe will excite our customers even more. We anticipate continued success in the near future, and we're committed to delivering products that exceed expectations.","391":"Now let's move on to our latest product offerings and updates. [SEP] I think, as you saw in the release, there are some new devices that take advantage of the underlying service that we think will be really convenient for sellers and interesting for device makers. [SEP] We are confident that these new devices will help fuel revenue growth for us in the upcoming quarters.","392":"We have made a strategic decision to discontinue one of our product lines. [SEP] And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers. [SEP] However, we anticipate this decision will lead to greater profitability in the long term.","393":"Our investments in India have shown promising results and we are excited about the growth potential in this market. We have seen significant improvement in our sales and revenue streams since expanding our operations in India.

We're confident that with our strategic vision and innovative solutions, we're well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.","395":"We've been investing heavily in our AI capabilities to improve our products and services. [SEP] So there is actually expense related to AI that's on the human side in the near-and medium-term as well. [SEP] However, we believe that the long-term benefits and efficiencies gained from AI will far outweigh these initial costs.","396":"We have received questions about our pricing strategy and how it may affect our competitiveness in the market. I want to address those concerns now. [SEP] And even with all the pricing action we took, we, from a total cost of ownership or just raw pricing perspective are very competitive versus what\u2019s available in the market. [SEP] Of course, we will continue to keep a close eye on our pricing strategy as we navigate the market. However, we are confident in our current position and believe that our offerings provide high value to customers. Thank you for your question.","397":"One of our main values as a company is to prioritize the needs and desires of our customers. In order to achieve this, we have been exploring different strategies to empower our users and provide them with more control over their experiences. [SEP] I do generally - I mean, I believe very strongly in trying to decentralize and put power in individual's hands. [SEP] This approach not only aligns with our company values, but it also has the potential to improve our business in the long term. By providing more autonomy and freedom to our customers, we can foster a sense of loyalty and trust that can't be achieved through traditional marketing and advertising methods. Overall, I believe that our commitment to decentralization will serve us well in the years to come.","398":"Our international growth continues to be a bright spot for the company, with membership numbers increasing steadily over the past quarter. [SEP] And so in some respects we are giving benefits earlier in the lifecycle to international Prime customers than we did in North America just because it launched later. [SEP] However, we remain committed to providing equal value to all of our Prime customers, regardless of where they are located. As we continue to expand globally, we will work to ensure that our benefits are consistent across all regions.","399":"We're really excited about some of the new technologies that we're going to be able to leverage in the coming year.

[SEP] You'd see that in that line item, which is about $2.2 billion here in the second quarter. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our company this quarter, but we recognize there's still room for improvement in certain areas.","403":"Our team has been working diligently to analyze and optimize our asset management strategy. We've looked at our equipment, our maintenance plans, and our operational processes to find ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

[SEP] This is a significant achievement that will positively impact our financial performance. By extending the useful life of our assets, we will see a decrease in capital expenditures over time. Additionally, our increased efficiency will lead to a reduction in operating expenses and an overall improvement in our bottom line.","404":"We have received a lot of questions about our plans for the iPhone market in the upcoming year.

[SEP] And in terms of ad load growth, I pointed to the fact that we continue to expect that ad load will be a less significant factor in the remainder of 2017, and that's certainly the case. [SEP] What other factors do you see driving revenue growth in the coming quarters?","408":"Can you provide more information on how you came up with the pricing for your new streaming service? [SEP] But you need to keep in mind that we contemplate a number of factors including the fact that we have family sharing as part of the service, the fact that there are multiple device purchases, the geographic availability around the world, the availability of local content at the beginning of the service, how many people do we have with payment methods on file. [SEP] Overall, we feel confident in the pricing strategy we have developed based on these various considerations.","409":"Can you give us some more insight into the performance of your international segment?

[SEP] And we started some early small tests around f8 last year where with some ecommerce services made it so that people who were buying things could follow up with the business and get customer support and buy more things. [SEP] These tests have been incredibly successful so far, and we're looking forward to rolling out these features more broadly in the coming months. We believe that by providing better customer support and making it easier for people to buy more of the products they love, we can build even deeper relationships with our customers and drive long-term revenue growth for our business.","435":"Another area of growth for us has been our grocery delivery service.

[SEP] We're seeing a lot of positive feedback from our customers and we're excited to continue expanding this service in the coming months.","436":"We have seen significant growth in our platform's group and community features over the past quarter.

[SEP] And so to me, that represents a qualitative change, and so the type of dialogue we have, whether it's with an auto company or a financial services company or a retail company, is much deeper, much broader. [SEP] This has allowed us to deliver more value to our clients and ultimately drive business growth for ourselves.","438":"We have introduced a new monthly subscription plan for our services, which we believe will cater to a wider audience. [SEP] Annual is still going to be a better deal but we know that customers may try it more frequently if it's a monthly plan, and that's what we're looking for. [SEP] We are confident that this new pricing strategy will help us increase our customer base and improve our overall revenue.","439":"We've had a challenging year, but I firmly believe that we've overcome the worst of it.

[SEP] Of course, there are still obstacles ahead, but with the strategies we have in place, I'm confident we can continue to grow and succeed.","440":"We have time for one more question on the call. [SEP] I will take the opportunity and asked about Windows 10 in the enterprise market that we are encouraged by the pace of deployment, the number of proof of concepts, and actually some of the stability we've seen in the commercial PC market in terms of starting to see some so I think overall I think we will continue to watch, but our security and management value prop I think really is paying off. [SEP] Thank you for your question. Next, we will take a question from an online participant.","441":"We've been talking a lot about our new chatbot technology and how it's going to revolutionize the way customers interact with our company. [SEP] And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then just get a response back quickly, but asynchronously so it doesn't take up your full attention, then we think that's going to be a really big deal. [SEP] Our team has been working around the clock to perfect this technology and we're really excited about the potential impact it could have on our business.","442":"We recognize the importance of providing a safe and positive environment for our users to engage in social interactions on our platform.

[SEP] We're committed to providing our customers with the flexibility and convenience of cloud enrollment for all of our server products.","450":"We've seen continued momentum in our messaging and Stories products as people use these to communicate and share with their friends and family. In Q3, we saw 1.3 billion people use Messenger, with more than 10 billion messages sent between people and businesses on the platform. [SEP] Another example is there are tens of millions of people, maybe more, but I'll go with that, who, on Android, use Messenger as not only their app for Facebook messaging but also for SMS, as their SMS client.

[SEP] This has been driven in part by our increased investment in digital marketing and our efforts to optimize our ad targeting algorithms.","453":"Our company has had significant growth in the past quarter, largely driven by our focus on higher layer services. We have seen a steady increase in demand for these services, and we believe this trend will continue. [SEP] Overall, the shift to the higher layer services is the real driver here, which is obviously Office 365 and its various levels is one factor.

We will continue to focus on offering a range of SKUs to meet the needs of all our customers.","469":"Our company's shift towards a more cloud-based approach has been a key focus for us this quarter.

[SEP] It's clear that building on top of Azure is now becoming a standard way of doing business, regardless of the industry you're in. And that's a really exciting trend that we're committed to supporting and nurturing over the long term.","471":"We believe that our strategy of combining our technology with our unique approach to customer engagement is going to be a game-changer for our industry.

Thank you for your continued support as we embark on this exciting journey.","472":"Can you elaborate on your strategy for investing in new technologies? [SEP] The reason why we give disproportionate attention to it is because we're trying to help push forward new formats that are not just about consuming content but are really about interacting, so Live, 360 video, and there will be others in the future.

We're very pleased with the progress we're making in this area. [SEP] Of course we don\u2019t count that in our run rates or when we talk about our $6 billion plus run rate, that\u2019s just pure public Cloud number and that\u2019s fantastic to see and we want to measure it that way. [SEP] However, it's important to note that we do have other segments of our business that contribute to our overall run rate. Our private cloud and hybrid cloud offerings are also important parts of our business that shouldn't be overlooked. That being said, we're thrilled with the success of our public Cloud business and will continue to focus on growing that segment in the future.","477":"Our overall revenue growth in the last quarter was strong, but we see significant potential in improving our ability to generate revenue from Stories. As we look ahead to the next quarter, this will be one of our key focus areas. [SEP] And from a pricing perspective, there's - we've got to improve our ability to grow the number of advertisers using Stories and improve price there, but it's going to be more reliant on that in terms of revenue growth.

[SEP] What we said for FY20 and certainly in Q1 as we expected to be up sequentially in Q1 and we will continue to get some headwind because of the strong Azure IaaS and PaaS growth we expect through the year, but we certainly think that Azure fundamental gross margin improvement will help offset that next year.

Our team is working to understand the root cause of this trend and will continue to evaluate its impact on our financials.","486":"A question was asked regarding Apple's decision to offer a bundle of services in their latest update, and whether it would affect their revenue.

[SEP] Now, as we enter 2019, I am confident that we have a clear direction and strategy in place.","488":"Our social media strategy has been critical to our recent success. We've been able to reach a wider audience and engage with our customers in ways that we never could before. [SEP] The format is so visually appealing and people are telling stories with pictures, so we see both anecdotally and in the data that this is a great place for people to become aware of a product in the first place.

Our goal is to not only raise awareness of our products, but to also drive meaningful engagement with our customers.","489":"We've had a number of exciting partnerships this quarter that have allowed us to showcase the power of our e-commerce platform.

[SEP] Additionally, I want to emphasize that we are making significant investments in our cloud infrastructure to ensure that our services are reliable and scalable, which will further support our growth efforts.","493":"We've noticed a significant increase in our overall revenue this quarter. [SEP] And then we tend to defer some revenue on some other categories, like for example gift cards or some AppleCare, but in general by far the largest element is the change in ESPs. [SEP] However, we anticipate this trend to slow down in the next quarter due to certain market factors.","494":"Moving on to our cloud computing segment, which continues to be a major driver of growth for our business. [SEP] Revenue growth was the same as Q2, and now we're at an $18 billion run rate, whereas last quarter when I had this call, we were at $16 billion, so very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. [SEP] We are also seeing increased adoption of our AI and machine learning services within our AWS offerings.","495":"Now moving on to our user numbers and installation base.

We are confident that this new system will have a positive impact on our business as we continue to grow and expand into new markets.","497":"Our revenue for the last quarter was $1.2 billion, which was slightly lower than expected due to a decrease in consumer spending. [SEP] And so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing.

Despite the challenging comparison, we believe that our strong brand and loyal customer base will allow us to continue delivering strong results.","498":"We received some feedback from our customers and made changes accordingly.

Apple Music continues to grow in popularity, and we're seeing strong subscriber numbers for Apple Arcade and Apple TV+.

We're exploring new marketing strategies and partnerships to help spread the word about this innovative product.","503":"When asked about our expectations for the upcoming quarter, we took into account the current market trends and our own internal projections.

[SEP] Our partnership with these startups has allowed us to improve our products and services and attract new customers.","505":"We have been in a legal dispute with one of our major suppliers over pricing for the past year. [SEP] Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. [SEP] Our legal team is confident in our case and we believe the courts will rule in our favor.","506":"We have been closely monitoring our user engagement metrics over the past quarter. [SEP] So there's lots that we are working on on engagement that continue to drive time spent. [SEP] Our team is also exploring new features and partnerships to further increase user engagement on our platform.","507":"As we look at our sales figures for the past quarter, we see a strong trend towards the adoption of mobile devices in enterprise settings. Our iPad sales to enterprise customers have grown significantly in the last year, and we are optimistic about the opportunities in this space. [SEP] The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce. [SEP] We believe that there is significant potential to increase adoption of iPads among enterprise customers, and we are exploring a range of strategies to encourage this. One key challenge we have identified is that many enterprises are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce, often only to senior executives or field staff. We are working to understand the reasons behind this trend and to develop solutions that will make it easier for companies to embrace iPads as a standard tool for their employees.","508":"We are seeing a shift in consumer behavior as more and more people are accessing our platform on mobile devices. [SEP] And obviously that will impact both, I think, the quality of the experience in terms of the ads they get and also the monetization for us. [SEP] So, our team is working on creating more mobile-friendly ad formats and optimizing our mobile ad placement to ensure that we can drive maximum revenue while still providing a seamless experience for our users.","509":"During the fourth quarter of 2020, our company witnessed a significant increase in revenue compared to the same period last year. [SEP] Since -- in 2016, I think it's very fair to say that we were behind where we needed to be as with a lot of -- the rest of the industry and governments as well and expecting the kind of information operations that we now have seen. [SEP] However, our team worked tirelessly to address these challenges and invested heavily in our technology and security measures to ensure that our platform remains a safe and trustworthy space for our users.","510":"During Q3, we saw strong growth across all of our platforms.

[SEP] As a result, we've seen improvements across the board in terms of productivity, cost savings, and overall performance. Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing these efforts and finding new ways to drive even greater gains and efficiencies in the future.","512":"We've had a lot of questions lately about our investment in Quantum computing. [SEP] So that's how we look at it, but you got to remember that before Quantum, there are many byproducts of a quantum effort that have significant implications on how we get more competitive, efficient in terms of providing computing to the world. [SEP] And we feel that our development in this area puts us in a strong position for growth in the future.","513":"We have been making some changes to our business model to ensure that we are able to drive more predictable revenue streams. [SEP] And our focus will always be making sure we have a clear roadmap for customers to make long-term commitments through annuity and so we are really trying to get away from some of that launch impact that you may normally expect to see. [SEP] Our goal is to have a sustainable and scalable business that is built to last, and we believe that focusing on annuity-based revenue is the best way to achieve that.","514":"We've noticed a significant uptick in engagement and an increase in revenue from our online articles and written content. [SEP] So that's really what's driving it, not a shift to a different format like video. [SEP] This is why we plan on allocating more resources towards improving our written content and continuing to enhance our user experience on our website.","515":"We're really excited about the latest Apple product release, the HomePod. This smart speaker is packed with features that we know our customers will love. [SEP] It also, obviously, you can also do things with HomePod like use it as a speaker phone. [SEP] We've also received great feedback on the sound quality of the HomePod. Customers have mentioned that it easily fills a room with rich, clear music. We're confident that the HomePod will continue to be a top product for us in the coming quarters.","516":"One of the reasons our customers are so loyal is because of our commitment to providing fast and reliable delivery. [SEP] So I think what that does is, again it strengthens your purchase decision, it strengthens the need to not have to go elsewhere to buy a product because you need it quickly. [SEP] And as we continue to expand our network of warehouses and distribution centers, we're confident we'll be able to offer even faster delivery times in the future.","517":"We've heard a lot of feedback from our clients about how they want to see our advertising products evolve, and I'm really excited to share with you some of the progress we've made in that area. [SEP] And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brand marketers to direct response to SMBs to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurements get better. [SEP] The investments we've made in machine learning and AI have really paid off, and we're seeing some incredible results across all of our advertising formats. As a result, we're confident that we'll be able to continue to drive value for our partners and shareholders in the months and years ahead.","518":"We are very optimistic about the growth prospects in this region. [SEP] It's a huge market and it's clear that many people will be moving into the middle class over time, as we've seen in other countries.

[SEP] Our reported results are on a normalized basis, removing the one-time item from last year, was 15%. [SEP] We continue to see strong growth in our core business and remain optimistic about the future.","520":"During the Q&A session of the conference call, a participant asked about the company's stance on government regulations. [SEP] So, we believe that there needs to be a regulatory framework in place for each of the major issues that I just talked about. [SEP] Our team has already reached out to policymakers and regulators to share our perspective and recommendations on these issues.","521":"We had projected a slight decrease in sales for this quarter, but to our delight, we actually saw a 3% increase. [SEP] That for us was a bit of a surprise, and a positive surprise, obviously. [SEP] We attribute this positive outcome to the new marketing strategy we implemented and the successful launch of our new product line. Our team is thrilled with these results and we plan to continue pushing for growth in the upcoming quarters.","522":"The Company's current video production capabilities are not as robust as their top competitors. [SEP] For production, I think that means that you need to get the camera experience, and the experience for capturing and uploading videos that you've captured to be much better in a more central part the of the experience. [SEP] By improving on these areas, we believe we can attract and retain a larger audience, especially amongst younger demographics who prioritize visual content.","523":"Now let's take a closer look at our revenue by customer segments. [SEP] In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. [SEP] We have been investing heavily in our sales and marketing efforts to continue driving growth across all segments.","524":"I'd now like to discuss our revenue recognition policy for our Prime subscription service. [SEP] This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method. [SEP] This change in accounting resulted in a decrease in our reported subscription revenue for the first quarter, but we believe it provides a more accurate representation of the timing of our revenue recognition.","525":"We are thrilled to report another strong quarter and want to thank our dedicated teams for their hard work and perseverance through a challenging year. [SEP] And maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year, during the March quarter. [SEP] Additionally, we are confident in our ability to continue expanding our services business and investing in new technologies to drive future growth.","526":"One thing to keep in mind is that while we provide many free services to our users, they still have value. [SEP] That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services. [SEP] This allows us to account for the cost of providing these services over time, rather than taking a large hit to our earnings in the quarter they are provided.","527":"And we're confident that this acquisition will help us expand our offerings in an area where we see a lot of growth potential. [SEP] So they will have that same profile, which is lower-margin services first, higher-margin services over time. [SEP] We believe that by offering this full range of services, we'll be able to better meet the needs of our clients and create long-term value for our shareholders.","528":"We're now going to open the floor for questions. [SEP] It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good support from our scale. [SEP] Our financial performance this quarter has been quite impressive, thanks in large part to strong demand for our products in key markets.","529":"Moving on to our financial results, I'd like to discuss our net income for the quarter. [SEP] It is actually impacted by the same thing that impacted free cash flow this quarter, which is about a $1.3 billion on settled cash settlement impact. [SEP] However, we expect this impact to be mitigated in the next quarter, as we continue to manage our cash settlement processes more efficiently.","530":"In terms of our photo sharing capabilities, we are constantly evaluating the market and our competitors. [SEP] Of course remember that both Apple and Google has built cameras and private photo sharing and photo management directly into their operating system.

[SEP] And I just go back to the three factors that I cited in the past that the regulatory landscape is continuing to evolve.

And the third factor is changing consumer preferences and behaviors, which are influencing how we approach our products and services.\" \n\nAnalyst: \"Thank you for that overview. Can you give us some specific examples of how you are adapting to these three factors?\" \n\nCEO: \"Certainly, we have recently implemented new compliance protocols to stay ahead of changing regulations, invested in AI technology to better compete with emerging fintech companies, and have launched several digital-first banking products to meet the changing needs of our customers.","534":"Looking ahead, we are confident in our strategic plan and investment decisions.

We are committed to responsible spending and contributing to long-term sustainable growth.","535":"We are pleased to report a strong quarter with steady growth in our Services business. [SEP] And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in our Services division and remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers while driving profitability for our shareholders.","536":"Our expansion efforts are continuing to pay off, and we are seeing positive results in the markets we have entered.

Our team is excited about the opportunities ahead, and we remain focused on delivering strong results for our shareholders.","537":"Can you walk us through the process of onboarding new sellers on your platform?

[SEP] We expect this to result in higher yields and more efficient use of our production capacity.","541":"Our focus this quarter has been on meeting the changing needs of our customers. [SEP] And so, we're seeing consumers adopting that and we're building products for them. [SEP] As a result, we've seen strong growth in our sales numbers for the past few months.","542":"One analyst on the call asked about the company's performance in a particular quarter where supply seemed to be a major issue. [SEP] I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. [SEP] However, we are working diligently to address the supply constraint and expect to have a clearer picture of the demand in the next quarter.","543":"Our upgrade cycle has been slower than anticipated in the United States. [SEP] Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States, where we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? [SEP] However, we have seen strong demand for upgrades in international markets despite the higher prices.","544":"Now, moving onto our small and medium-sized business segment [SEP] There's still a small business at 100 people, but they are a growing business and showing the power of how our work with SMBs is growing jobs. [SEP] We're really proud of the positive impact we're having on local economies and job creation through our partnerships with SMBs.","545":"We've been discussing the idea of implementing more ads in our social media platforms. We understand the importance of generating revenue, but we also want to prioritize the user experience. [SEP] So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right [SEP] We're still exploring different possibilities and gathering feedback from our users and advertisers. We want to ensure that any ads we do implement are relevant and non-invasive. Ultimately, it's all about striking a balance between profitability and user satisfaction.","546":"Our technology infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations. [SEP] Then we've got data centers and data centers is a growing expenditure for us [SEP] However, despite the investment required, our data centers have enabled us to provide more reliable services to our clients and our employees.","547":"We've seen significant growth in our ad revenue from companies based in China over the past few quarters.

[SEP] So \u2013 and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. [SEP] But despite these seasonal challenges, I'm pleased to report that we still exceeded our revenue targets for the quarter.","550":"We've been investing heavily in our content systems over the past year. [SEP] Our content systems are getting more mature, there\u2019s a lot of more work to do in each of those. [SEP] But with each update, we're seeing improvements in engagement and revenue generation.","551":"As we move into the future of technology, I believe that there is a huge potential for augmented reality. [SEP] I think, AR has the ability to amplify human performance instead of isolating humans. [SEP] By utilizing this technology, we can create a world where humans and machines work together in harmony, opening up endless possibilities for innovation and growth.","552":"Our advertising team has really been making strides lately, particularly in the area of targeted advertising. We've been seeing some great results from our campaigns, and we're excited to keep pushing forward with new initiatives. [SEP] And when they have an ad and they can get a direct contact one to one with a customer, that's been something that people are really excited about. [SEP] Of course, it's not just about the ads themselves. We're also working hard to provide excellent customer service and support, so that people feel genuinely valued when they interact with our brand. Overall, we're confident that our focus on personalized advertising and customer engagement will continue to pay off in the long run.","553":"The moderator asked for the company's stance on the recent tax reform proposals being discussed in Congress. [SEP] We've been a longtime advocate of structural tax reform, and so we'll just wait and see how things play out. [SEP] In the meantime, we'll continue to focus on driving efficiency and maximizing our bottom line.","554":"Now turning to our gross margin performance. [SEP] But that said, we see plenty of opportunity for total gross margin growth in terms of dollars just because of the number of markets that we participate, in which we by the way, never participated in the old server world. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to continue to increase gross margins as we expand into new markets and offer more advanced solutions.","555":"We understand that the market is constantly changing and evolving. [SEP] But so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that were beneficial to them. [SEP] That's why we're always looking for ways to innovate and improve our products and services.","556":"Now let's turn our attention to our workforce and staffing levels. [SEP] Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68% I believe. [SEP] Looking forward, we expect headcount growth to continue at a more moderate pace in line with our business operations.","557":"I think we're just continuing to see a secular trend of the technology industry really being the backbone of not only what businesses need to operate but how consumers live their lives. [SEP] And so therefore, from a secular perspective, we are all in on making sure that we invest in our commercial cloud as well as our investments in things like gaming and going after the opportunity that is there in front of us. [SEP] And so, it's a moment in time where you have this secular trend intersecting with an economic response to the pandemic, which has led to greater digital acceleration and investment.

[SEP] Despite the challenges we've faced, we remain optimistic about our ability to achieve our long-term growth objectives.","562":"I'd like to discuss our product offerings for this quarter. [SEP] When you look at our current product portfolio, it is much broader than it used to be. [SEP] We have expanded into new markets and introduced new features to keep up with changing customer needs and preferences.","563":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our logistics operations and remain competitive in the market. [SEP] And we have - again trying to take advantage of the fulfillment capacity and transportation capacity especially with third-party partners that we have. [SEP] This has led to increased efficiency and cost savings for both us and our third-party partners.","564":"Our revenue has been impacted significantly due to the fluctuations in currency rates. We have been closely monitoring the impact of currency movements on our business. [SEP] And the other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second and now we've gone through a couple of cycles where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. [SEP] We have implemented various strategies to mitigate the impact of currency movements on our revenue. Our focus has been on increasing our revenue from international markets and reducing our exposure to currency risk.","565":"We have received a lot of questions from investors about our plans for expenses in the upcoming year. Can you give us some insight into how you're thinking about this? [SEP] In terms of the expense guide in 2020, I would say that obviously we plan to -- a large factor of our expense growth is driven off of headcount. [SEP] Can you give us an idea of how much you plan to increase headcount, and in which departments or areas?\"\n\n\"So, our plan is to continue to invest heavily in our product development and customer support teams, which is where we're seeing the most growth and demand. We also plan to open up a new office in a strategic location, which will require hiring additional staff.\"\n\n\"Of course, we're also mindful of keeping our expenses under control, and we'll be closely monitoring our spending in non-essential areas. Overall, we're confident that these investments will pay off in the long run and position us for continued success.","566":"We are pleased to report strong growth in our e-commerce platform this quarter.

Overall, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders.","569":"We've seen encouraging growth in this particular geographic region and we believe there is still untapped potential.

[SEP] You are seeing us take other steps like a buy button, like the Marketplace launch, which are really aimed at improving some of the experiences we think people are trying to have and already having in organic ways on Facebook. [SEP] Our buy button allows users to make transactions directly within Facebook, making it more convenient and seamless than ever before.

[SEP] We continue to see great potential in these offerings and are committed to investing in further enhancements to bring even greater value to our customers.","575":"We did see a slight dip in sales compared to last quarter, but overall the numbers are still very strong.

I'm pleased to report that we have had a strong quarter, with revenue growth of 15% year over year, driven by our diversified product portfolio and geographic expansion.

[SEP] Our team has been working closely with local Chinese companies to understand their needs and provide them with tailored solutions to expand their customer base abroad. This has resulted in significant revenue growth for both our partners and our company. We are committed to continuing this partnership and expanding our reach in the Chinese market. Thank you.","580":"Our marketing team worked hard this quarter to optimize our ad campaigns on various social media platforms.

[SEP] This switch led to a significant increase in brand recognition and sales, which exceeded our projections for the quarter.","581":"One of the things we've seen in the market is a trend towards hybrid environments where customers are deploying workloads both on-premise and in the cloud. This is particularly important for certain industries like healthcare and financial services where data sovereignty and regulatory compliance requirements are critical. [SEP] In general today Mark almost all of that benefit shows up in what I would say as the on-premise KPI, and so over time though how you should think about that it will eventually show up in Azure consumed revenue growth, this is a benefit that\u2019s fundamentally about high value and flexibility and meeting customers where they are so that they can make a determination of when to make that choice. [SEP] We believe this hybrid approach is the future of computing and will continue to invest heavily in tools and technologies that enable seamless integration between on-premise and cloud environments.

[SEP] Keep in mind; we started in acquisition where we were below our targeted range. [SEP] However, with recent successful acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we are confident in our ability to reach our targeted range in the coming quarters.","584":"Now, let's talk about our revenue breakdown for the quarter. [SEP] If you want to get to total bookings, you just add back in all the consumer revenue, is technically is how you would do it [SEP] But for the purpose of today's discussion, we will only focus on our net bookings.","585":"Our overall revenue in the last quarter has increased significantly, largely due to the growth of our cloud services. [SEP] But at this point I would say, we have emerging ISVs, some of the global ISVs building SaaS applications on top of Azure driving a significant amount of growth of new businesses, the new business models emerging on Azure, as well as hybrid, which I would say are driving. [SEP] We are continuing to invest in both the development and marketing of our Azure platform, as we believe it is crucial to the future success of our company.","586":"We are extremely pleased with the progress we have made in the last quarter and would like to share with you our updated guidance. Our team has been working hard to drive operational efficiencies and we are seeing positive results. [SEP] So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. [SEP] Additionally, we have updated our revenue guidance to reflect stronger than expected demand for our products. Our sales team has been successful in expanding our customer base and increasing our market share. Overall, we feel confident in our ability to exceed expectations for the remainder of the year.","587":"We have received many questions regarding the timeframe for the release of our new product line. [SEP] And just to clarify, what we had been saying was early 2015, and we sort of look at the year and think of early as the first four months, mid is the next four months and late is the final four months. [SEP] We want to make sure our customers have a clear understanding of when they can expect these new products to hit the market. We will continue to keep investors and stakeholders informed on any updates regarding the product launch.","588":"Let's take a few more questions. [SEP] Justin on time spent, there is no question that video is helping us on time spent and engagement. [SEP] We're also seeing great results from our new social media campaigns.","589":"We have seen impressive growth across our product lines this quarter, especially in our cloud services offering. Our focus on digital transformation and modern workplaces has allowed us to capture new market opportunities and deliver more value to our customers. [SEP] Overall I would say there\u2019s a secular movement that\u2019s happening in particular with Office 365, quite frankly, it\u2019s happening across the entire product portfolio of Microsoft which is more to what I would described as annuity relationship as well as subscription relationships. [SEP] As a result, we are experiencing a shift towards a more predictable revenue stream that aligns with our long-term strategy. This is particularly evident with Office 365, which has become the cornerstone of our productivity and collaboration solutions. We remain committed to investing in our product portfolio and delivering the best possible experience to our customers, while continuing to drive sustained growth for our business.","590":"Our mobile app platform has seen tremendous growth over the past quarter. We're excited to share some of the latest developments with you today. [SEP] The number of developers that are writing apps more for it are impressive and we\u2019re seeing some incredible innovation coming out there. [SEP] This growth is driving increased revenue for our company, and we're confident it will continue to do so in the future. We're committed to supporting our developers and providing them with the tools and resources they need to create amazing apps on our platform.","591":"In terms of our financial performance, we have seen some challenges this quarter. [SEP] We\u2019re looking of course at our cost structure, and we try to remain as competitive as possible. [SEP] However, despite the difficulties, we are confident in our ability to continue to grow.","592":"Our digital advertising platform has been performing exceptionally well. We're thrilled to report another quarter of success, where we've seen growth across all our key metrics. [SEP] We're growing the number of advertisers and publishers, and we're continuing to see growth and we'll continue to invest. [SEP] Our team is focusing on developing new features and improving our offerings to ensure that we remain at the forefront of the digital advertising industry. We anticipate that this investment will support our continued growth and drive long-term value for all our stakeholders.","593":"We've seen our mobile DAUs continue to grow over the past quarter, which has resulted in a shift in the overall impression mix between desktop and mobile. As we continue to invest in our mobile product offerings, we expect this trend to continue. [SEP] So as it gets smaller, it has less of a depressive effect on the overall impression growth number, because if you recall, desktop has quite a number of impressions per DAU, just given it's the right-hand column that has multiple impressions on each screen. [SEP] This shift in impression mix has impacted our overall impression growth rate, but we remain confident in the strength of our mobile offerings and the long-term growth potential they provide. Over time, we expect mobile to become an even larger portion of our overall business, and we remain committed to investing in its continued success.","594":"Can you comment on the company's growth outlook for the next quarter? [SEP] Even at decreasing growth rates, we are still growing and predicting growth at very healthy rates, and that's based on returning for advertisers. [SEP] We've seen great success with our recent marketing campaigns and we expect to expand our customer base even further in the coming months.","595":"Our goal is to improve our margins and drive profitability for our shareholders. [SEP] We have been working and continuing to reinvest and save through the year as we look to get everything here more efficient. [SEP] We believe this investment in efficiency will enable us to better serve our customers and increase our overall revenue.","596":"Our overall revenue for Q3 was strong, with a year-over-year increase of 10%. [SEP] And so I do think we saw some impact, particularly in SQL and I do expect to see some of that in Q4. [SEP] However, we are confident that our strong product portfolio and customer relationships will continue to drive growth, and we are forecasting a strong finish to the year.","597":"When we look at our user engagement numbers over the last quarter, we're definitely seeing some interesting trends. [SEP] I think that's pretty similar to the trends that we've seen in that metric. [SEP] Of course, there are always fluctuations and variables at play, but overall I'm feeling optimistic about our user engagement efforts.","598":"We recognize that these are unprecedented times and our customers are facing economic challenges. [SEP] But for the near-term, the way that we\u2019re thinking about it is offering as many of these things at cost and for free as possible to deliver as much value to small businesses and businesses around the world. [SEP] In the long-term, we are focusing on innovating and expanding our product offerings to meet the evolving needs of the market.","599":"One of our key priorities for the year has been to invest heavily in research and development. [SEP] For example, the work that we're doing on full end-to-end encryption, that's just -- that's a long-term project. [SEP] However, we believe that the benefits of implementing this technology will be immense, and we are committed to seeing it through to completion.","600":"In addition to our efforts with Instagram, we are continuing to invest in our messaging platforms. We see these platforms as a key growth opportunity for the company. [SEP] We have a number of other things that we're working on across Messenger and WhatsApp. [SEP] We believe that incorporating more features such as payment options and e-commerce capabilities will enhance the user experience and provide new revenue streams. We are excited about the potential of these platforms and will continue to prioritize their development.","601":"We are seeing tremendous growth in our cloud services as more and more companies are looking to modernize their IT systems. Our focus on innovation and customer service has enabled us to become a leader in this space. [SEP] Interesting enough, we have a lot of requirements around edge devices even, so that you can have databases with compute so that you can really have what is needed at the edge, that\u2019s sort of one conversation. [SEP] Another important discussion we're having with customers is around cybersecurity. As the amount of data being generated and stored continues to increase, protecting that data from cyber threats is becoming increasingly crucial. We are investing heavily in this area to ensure that our customers have the best possible protection.","602":"I'd like to focus now on our performance in emerging markets. [SEP] And in fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. [SEP] This is a testament to the resilience of our business model and the strength of our relationships with customers in these regions.","603":"We have been working hard to increase customer retention and loyalty. [SEP] That's to us to the best way for us to keep having that recurring value. [SEP] We will continue to focus on providing exceptional service and innovation to maintain our customer satisfaction and retention rates.","604":"We have seen some fluctuations in our bookings and expiry rates in the past quarter. We have been closely analyzing the data to understand the underlying trends. [SEP] I think there is and you'll see that dynamic, so if the expiry base is a little bigger, you'd expect obviously a number bigger than that on the booking side and when the expiry rates' growth - it's really about the delta between the two as you know. [SEP] We are confident that our strategy to drive increased bookings will continue to yield positive results. Our team is focused on building stronger relationships with our customers and enhancing our product offerings to better meet their needs. We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and achieving our long-term growth objectives.","605":"When asked about the perceived competition between our company and social media platforms, our CEO had this to say:\n\nStatement: \"It\u2019s not always the choice of TV or Facebook, but often we can be a complement. [SEP] It\u2019s not always the choice of TV or Facebook, but often we can be a complement. [SEP] As more and more viewers multitask while watching TV, we see ourselves as a valuable second-screen option for engaging with audiences and creating a truly immersive viewing experience. By partnering with social media companies and investing in our own digital capabilities, we can continue to be a powerful force in the media landscape.","606":"During the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our Teams platform, driven by increased demand for remote collaboration and digital communication tools. [SEP] The other point about Teams is just not limited to knowledge workers, which has been really the only place traditionally we play. [SEP] We've been excited to see the adoption of Teams in other types of industries as well, such as healthcare and education. This opens up new opportunities for us to expand our offerings and reach new markets.","607":"Our app review team has made significant progress in ensuring that only high-quality apps are available on our platform. [SEP] And where it is not perfect, we wind up reviewing over 100,000 apps per week between new apps and updates for existing apps, and then work with developers quickly to fix the issues. [SEP] This rigorous process has led to a reduction in the number of low-quality, fraudulent, and non-compliant apps on our platform, and has helped us maintain the trust and satisfaction of our users.","608":"During our first quarter, we faced some significant headwinds that impacted our financial performance. [SEP] Of course, as you look further out, you know we do not provide guidance past the March quarter, but it goes without saying that at current levels, again those headwinds will continue to become stronger for the reason I explained earlier, that our hedges continue to expire, they get replaced by new hedging contracts at current levels and we don't have the same level of protection that we had in the past. [SEP] This means that we need to remain vigilant in managing our costs and continuing to explore new revenue streams. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term.","609":"Our research shows that a significant portion of our customer base is still using 3G devices. [SEP] And so there's an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 3G handsets. [SEP] We are actively promoting our newer devices and services to these customers and expect to see a significant boost in revenue from this upgrade cycle in the coming quarters.","610":"Our company is continuously innovating to stay ahead of the competition. [SEP] And that means there's, in many ways, almost limitless opportunity for consumers to do more. [SEP] As a result, we expect to see strong growth in sales and revenue in the coming quarters.","611":"We are excited to announce our updated strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to ensure that we are able to seamlessly integrate these two areas moving forward.","612":"I would like to address our company's current approach to digital payments. As you know, we have been exploring various avenues to make online transactions more seamless and secure... [SEP] And we also differentiate between payment systems that are built on top of the existing financial infrastructure like what we're trying to do with WhatsApp payments or when we make payments in Instagram Shopping, and our work with something like Libra that is trying to build some new technological infrastructure for financial services. [SEP] Overall, we're excited to continue innovating in the field of digital payments, and we believe that by offering options that build on existing infrastructure as well as new technologies, we can create a more inclusive financial system for everyone.","613":"We've seen fantastic growth in our Stories feature over the past year... [SEP] I would say Stories is today from an impression growth perspective really about Instagram Stories. [SEP] We've been able to innovate and add new features to keep users engaged and coming back daily, which has helped drive advertising revenue.","614":"Moving on to our cloud computing segment, I am pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter. [SEP] I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. [SEP] We are continuing to invest in the growth of our AWS business, and we anticipate even stronger results in the coming quarters.","615":"Can you provide some context around the customer retention rate for the third quarter? [SEP] The 86% also seems low to me but I was quoting a third-party source and not our own data. [SEP] We will do a deep dive into our own data to get a better understanding of our current customer retention rate and see if there are any areas we can improve upon.","616":"We continue to see growth in the cloud computing market and are focused on expanding our offerings to meet the needs of our customers. [SEP] So one of the things that we are in fact very focused on is enabling others to build their own clouds. [SEP] Through our cloud platform, we have seen businesses of all sizes successfully build and scale their own cloud infrastructure, and we believe this trend will continue to grow in the coming years.","617":"Our earnings report shows an increase in revenue from Office Consumer products, mainly due to strong sales in developed markets. [SEP] So the strength from that outperformance or better market in consumer PCs in developed markets is a direct correlation to our performance in Office Consumer. [SEP] Additionally, our Office Consumer segment has seen a rise in demand for remote work tools as more people continue to work from home.","618":"When asked about the impact of the recent decline in the value of the US dollar on the company's financial performance, the CEO responded... [SEP] Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, if it holds, will be a positive but it's not something that you're going to be seeing translating to gross margin tailwind quickly. [SEP] However, we do anticipate some benefits in terms of increased demand for our products in markets outside of the US.","619":"Our earnings this quarter have exceeded our expectations and we're excited to share some updates with you all. [SEP] So very, very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year.

[SEP] And we're seeing a lot of great examples of people using ads in the feed across Instagram and News Feed. [SEP] Our teams have been working hard to improve the relevance and personalization of our ads, and we're confident this will drive even more success for our advertisers in the coming quarters.","621":"Our user engagement metrics have continued to improve, especially in the area of video. Users are spending more time watching videos on our platform than ever before. [SEP] That means more time in video, and that does come at the expense of some impression growth in News Feed. [SEP] However, we believe that this shift towards video will ultimately result in a more engaged user base, as videos tend to generate higher levels of emotional response and social interaction. Additionally, we are exploring new ways to monetize video content, which could result in significant revenue growth for the company in the future.","622":"Now I would like to focus on some of the key areas of growth that we've experienced over the past few quarters. [SEP] When I look at what's happening with say some of the most innovative work we've done around distributed computing which is service fabric and how people are in fact going straight to building out using our past services some of the new HyperScale cloud services using microservices and not only are they doing that but we're also seeing great growth in our serverless infrastructure which is Azure functions. [SEP] Overall, we are very encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing in our cloud services and their adoption among our customers.","623":"We are constantly working to improve the user experience on our platform. [SEP] And so a lot of the underlying things we do to build our ad systems don't just feed into revenue, they feed into quality. [SEP] This focus on quality not only benefits our advertisers but also enhances the overall user experience, which is a top priority for us.","624":"Now let's turn to our international segment and see how that's been performing. [SEP] So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup. [SEP] Overall, we are confident in the long-term growth potential of our international business and will continue to prioritize investments in this area.","625":"We have decided to discontinue our old suite of products and transition fully to Dynamics 365. We believe this will provide a more streamlined experience for our customers and allow us to better serve their needs. [SEP] because we think that is a pretty old concept to have suites like that, which is we have now really made the entire Dynamics 365 much more modular, modern, and much more efficient for customers. [SEP] Our team has worked hard to create a modular system that allows for greater customization and flexibility. With Dynamics 365, customers can choose the features they need and leave behind those they don't. We believe this approach is more in line with the needs of modern businesses and will help us stay ahead of the curve.","626":"We have been working on our customer migration strategy for the past quarter. [SEP] What really matters is that when we get that migration and we are seeing it, we are able to show them the value [SEP] And the results are showing that our efforts have been successful in retaining and gaining new customers.\" \n\n\"What really matters is that when we get that migration and we are seeing it, we are able to show them the value. That's where our personalized approach to customer service comes in - we take the time to listen to their needs and tailor our solutions accordingly. By doing so, we have seen an increase in customer satisfaction and loyalty. Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize the customer experience and look for ways to enhance it even further.","627":"Now, moving on to our customer base and growth strategy. [SEP] We're very fortunate and work very hard to have loyal customers and to continue attracting an impressive number of switchers. [SEP] Our marketing efforts have been successful in highlighting the benefits of our products and services, and we are confident that we will continue to see growth in both our loyal customer base and switchers.","628":"One analyst on the call asked about the company's plans for expanding internationally. [SEP] Our focus is on this worldwide, and so it's not only a U.S. focus, but we want to deliver a great experience around the world and deliver it globally, and so we've put a lot of the energy into doing that. [SEP] The CEO added that they have already seen success in certain international markets and are continuing to invest in those regions.","629":"Looking back at the past quarter, there are a few key points we want to highlight. [SEP] If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. [SEP] Now moving on to our current quarter, we have made significant improvements to our operations and have largely overcome those capacity constraints.","630":"Our team has been working hard to manage expenses and optimize our operations. [SEP] We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX environment I think says a lot about all the work that we've done on the cost side to get there. [SEP] Additionally, we are continuing to explore opportunities for growth and expansion in key markets.","631":"Moving on to our product pipeline, I wanted to provide an update on one of our upcoming releases. [SEP] So the example of that is the new camera that we're working on and all the creative tools around that. [SEP] We anticipate great demand for this new camera and are excited to unveil it at our upcoming product launch event.","632":"We received a few questions from analysts and investors regarding ad blocking, so I wanted to address that head on. As you all know, ad blocking has been a hot topic in the industry lately, with some arguing that it could significantly impact revenue for companies like us. [SEP] On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that this quarter we had 18% year-over-year desktop revenue growth. [SEP] We did see some impact from ad blocking during the quarter, but it was minimal. Our desktop revenue growth of 18% year-over-year is a testament to the strength of our business model and the resilience of our advertising strategy. We're continuing to monitor the situation closely and invest in new technologies to ensure that we're always on top of the latest trends and developments in the market.","633":"Can you elaborate on how your cloud technology has impacted your gaming offerings? [SEP] And you look at even some of our games like Halo, a significant usage of our cloud. [SEP] Do you see the utilization of cloud technology continuing to grow in the future?\" \n\n\"We continue to see the benefits of utilizing our cloud technology in our gaming portfolio. In fact, we have seen a significant usage of it in one of our most popular franchises, Halo. Our cloud technology allows for seamless gameplay and improved performance for our players.","634":"We've been investing heavily in our marketing efforts this quarter, particularly in television ads targeting our key demographics.

[SEP] Based on our current metrics, we've found that digital ads have been performing better than traditional channels in terms of driving traffic to our website and ultimately converting into sales.","635":"We are happy to report that our advertising revenue has continued to grow steadily quarter after quarter. Our strategy of focusing on mobile-first advertising has paid off and we remain committed to investing in this area. [SEP] And we've improved the quality of the ads in News Feed, and that's another driver from the supply side. [SEP] On the demand side, we've seen strong growth in advertiser interest and spending, particularly in the ecommerce and direct-to-consumer categories. As we continue to innovate and offer more targeting capabilities, we expect this trend to continue. Overall, we are bullish on the future of advertising on our platform.","636":"There were a few challenges we faced this quarter,\" the CEO began. \"One of which was the impact of foreign exchange rates on our revenue.

We believe that delivering an exceptional user experience will ultimately drive business growth for us in the long run. [SEP] We are very focused there on the user experience, but we're also focused even earlier stages on growing our business ecosystem. [SEP] We're taking a strategic approach to expanding our business ecosystem by collaborating with key industry partners and investing in new technologies. By doing so, we're able to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers and create new opportunities for growth.","638":"With the recent passing of the tax reform bill, we are very pleased to see that our efforts have finally paid off.

Our team has been working hard to improve the user experience and it seems to be paying off.

[SEP] At the same time, we know we can't rest on our laurels. We're constantly looking for ways to innovate and improve, whether that means introducing new features or streamlining our processes. As long as we stay focused on delivering value to our users, we're confident that we can continue to grow the business.","641":"Now, turning our attention to Asia, specifically China, which is a key market for us.

[SEP] We see a lot of long-term growth potential in the region and are continuing to invest accordingly.","642":"Our company management believes that our new acquisitions along with our disciplined approach to expenses will help grow revenue and increase profitability. We are focused on strategically investing in our workforce to drive innovation and expand our customer base. [SEP] When I look at all the acquisitions that we have made over the course of last year and our OpEx guidance for next year shows how disciplined we are in bringing new talent in, be it in R&D, be it in sales and marketing. [SEP] We expect these investments to pay off in the long-term as we continue to differentiate ourselves in the market. Our commitment to talent acquisition and development is a cornerstone of our growth strategy, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to bring in top-tier talent as we execute on our vision for the future.","643":"When it comes to our smartphone lineup, we offer a range of options to meet the needs and preferences of our customers.

[SEP] These models continue to be popular choices among consumers who want a high-quality device at a more affordable price compared to our newer models.","644":"We have some exciting new developments to share with you all today about our cloud computing and cybersecurity efforts. Our team has been hard at work researching and implementing groundbreaking technologies that we believe will give us a competitive edge in the industry.

[SEP] We've already seen some impressive results from this approach, and we're confident that it will continue to pay off in the years ahead. I'd like to introduce you to one of our key initiatives in this area: an application that we've developed that's fundamentally distributed and also uses Azure Sphere for ransom and compute.

[SEP] When it comes to our Commercial Licensing and our servers, it\u2019s the same trend, Heather, which is the big shift that\u2019s happening is our enterprise and datacenter products, being Windows Server, Systems Centers , SQL Server, are more competitive. [SEP] This shift can be attributed to the emergence of cloud-based services and open-source alternatives in the market.","646":"Thank you for joining us for our quarterly earnings call.

[SEP] And I mentioned during the call in January that we were expecting FX to have a negative impact on a sequential basis of about 100 basis points after the effect of the hedges.

[SEP] And in More Personal Computing, the largest change in that segment is frankly the phone. [SEP] Our strategy to grow phone revenue by expanding our portfolio is resulting in higher gross margin.","650":"In response to a question about the company's strategy for increasing profit margins. [SEP] That's something that we want to make sure we follow more our opportunity in a customer across the board versus trying to micromanage to certain margins in very specific opportunities, because we think that it's the integrated ability for us to deliver value is which I think long term is what the customers expect of Microsoft. [SEP] Our focus is on providing quality products and services to our customers, and we believe that by doing so, we will ultimately see the financial success we are looking for.

[SEP] But we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there, even despite some downtime in India. [SEP] We've seen strong demand for our products in Europe and Asia, which has helped offset some of the challenges we faced in India.","656":"Our overall revenue for the quarter was slightly below expectations due to certain market challenges that began to surface towards the end of the period. [SEP] We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix shift towards Services. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects, and continue to invest in new product development and strategic acquisitions to further diversify our offerings.","657":"Now, turning to our financial results for the quarter. I will start by discussing the impact of a significant adjustment we made during the period. [SEP] As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was a $640 million adjustment and there was a one-off change. [SEP] We are confident that this adjustment has positioned us well for future growth and profitability, and we remain committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders.","658":"Can you tell us about any new projects or initiatives you're working on in the news sector? [SEP] And I don\u2019t have anything too specific to add today, we\u2019re trying to take a very consultative approach to how we develop anything around news or any of the things that touch the big social issues and certainly, supporting journalism is up there as one of the really important things that we care about. [SEP] Great, thank you for that update. Are there any other social issues that your company is currently focused on supporting?","659":"Our revenue has increased by 25% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. [SEP] We attribute this growth to our focus on improving user experience and expanding our marketing efforts.","660":"We have a strong balance sheet and continue to generate positive cash flow. Our revenue growth has been steady and we are confident in our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives. [SEP] That's primarily around technology, technical recruiting, software engineering, and we have a lot of opportunities that we see to invest in the long-term growth of the business. [SEP] We are also exploring potential acquisitions that align with our long-term growth strategy. Additionally, we plan to increase our marketing efforts to attract more customers to our platform. Overall, we are committed to investing in our business to drive sustained growth and profitability.","661":"Our revenue growth has been steady over the past few quarters, but we expect to see a significant increase in the coming months. [SEP] Some of that is in Q2, you'll see that more in the next few quarters. [SEP] We are focusing on expanding our reach in international markets, which will contribute to our growth in the long term. \nOverall, we are confident in our ability to exceed our financial targets for the year.","662":"We have seen significant growth in our messaging app over the past year, with more users choosing to communicate through our platform than ever before. [SEP] Messaging is really strategically important for the company and the long-term engagement with our users, and the organic feel of the engagement with businesses and consumers is where we will be focused. [SEP] To further strengthen our messaging capabilities, we plan to invest in new technologies and features that will enhance the user experience and provide even greater value to our users and partners.","663":"We continue to see strong growth in our third-party sales and services business. [SEP] Amazon vendors, sellers, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. [SEP] In fact, during the last quarter, over half of our units sold came from third-party sellers.","664":"I want to talk about our market share in the mobile app industry. [SEP] When I look at the usage, the usage is six times our nearest competitor. [SEP] This is a testament to the quality of our product and the loyalty of our users.","665":"We have been receiving a lot of questions about how we measure the success of our ad campaigns,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] And so any of the engagement with ad metrics, whether it's remembering an ad going back to \u2013 people have been measuring that for a long time too, how long a video ad is viewed, are only proxy metrics. [SEP] However, we believe that these proxy metrics still provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of our advertising efforts,\" added the CMO.","666":"Now moving on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] Just to give you a sense, on a year-over-year basis, when I look at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins. [SEP] However, we have implemented several initiatives to mitigate this impact and we remain optimistic about our profitability going forward.","667":"We've received a lot of questions about our revenue mix and how it's impacting our earnings. [SEP] The second component, and the one you'd asked about, is a little bit about that premium services revenue mix. [SEP] We've taken a few steps to address this, including investing in new products and expanding our marketing efforts.","668":"As we continue to expand our business solutions offerings, we have found that our customers often require a more tailored approach to their specific business processes. Therefore, we have integrated Dynamics 365 with AppSource to provide a more comprehensive solution. [SEP] You can connect them with all the business process data that's in Dynamics 365, but not just in Dynamics 365 but all the applications in AppSource because business process will always be a much more fragmented market as opposed to just one market share leader by industry, by vertical, by country. [SEP] Our goal is to offer a diverse set of options that can cater to any business needs, regardless of their industry, vertical, or country. By leveraging the power of Dynamics 365 and AppSource, our customers can easily access and integrate various business applications that align with their unique processes. We believe this approach will allow us to better serve our customers and remain competitive in this constantly evolving market.","669":"Our international expansion is a key focus for us in the coming year. We are excited to share some updates on our progress. [SEP] They are very different, you'll see the growth rate in India is very rapid. [SEP] We have also identified opportunities in South America and are exploring potential partnerships in the region. Overall, we are optimistic about the potential for international growth in the coming years.","670":"We have learned a lot about what works and what doesn't when it comes to advertising on our platform. [SEP] One is that the format of an ad really has to match the format of the consumer experience. [SEP] This is why we are investing heavily in developing more native ad formats that seamlessly blend into the user experience.","671":"Now let's move on to discuss our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] On the negative side, the headwind on gross margins on a year-over-year basis from foreign exchange is about 100 basis points. [SEP] However, we were able to partially offset this through cost savings initiatives and improved pricing strategies.","672":"During the quarter, we saw solid growth across all of our business units. [SEP] And so really and truly, it\u2019s sort of everything you look at in China was extremely good. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue as we deepen our partnerships and expand our offerings in the region.","673":"We are seeing strong growth in our Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering, which is contributing significantly to our overall revenue growth. [SEP] IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over, and then they start extending by writing more PaaS because it's sort of more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS. [SEP] Our platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering is also showing signs of strong growth as our customers recognize the efficiency and time-saving benefits of developing new applications using PaaS. We continue to invest in improving both our IaaS and PaaS offerings to ensure we remain a leader in the cloud computing market.","674":"Let's move on to discussing our corporate governance and Board composition. [SEP] Yes, on Board members, there are a lot of great leaders who serve on our Board, who have served on our Board. [SEP] Their expertise and guidance have been invaluable to our company's success.","675":"During the last quarter, we saw some impressive marketing campaigns that helped our clients drive strong results. [SEP] To share one of my favorite new examples, Subway working with their agency 360i developed video ads and images for Facebook and Instagram to promote the limited time offer Reuben sandwich. [SEP] As a result of this campaign, Subway saw a 25% increase in sales of the Reuben sandwich and increased engagement on their social channels.","676":"Our company has made significant investments in improving the quality of our products and services. We believe that these investments will have a positive impact on our customer satisfaction rates. [SEP] So I think that customers are going to see it in a variety of ways. [SEP] For example, our new mobile app has received great reviews and feedback from users who find it much easier to use than our previous version. Additionally, we have implemented a new customer service training program that has resulted in faster response times and more personalized interactions. Overall, we are confident that these improvements will make a difference in how our customers perceive our brand.","677":"In the past year, we've seen immense growth in our business, and we're excited to share our progress with you today. [SEP] We\u2019ve also said the manufacturing ramp that we\u2019ve had this year in the December quarter has been the fastest that we\u2019ve ever had. [SEP] This ramp has allowed us to meet the high demand for our products, and we're proud of the quality and efficiency that we've been able to achieve.","678":"We've talked a lot about our company strategy and growth plans, but let's dive a bit deeper into our product offerings. [SEP] But having said that, if to your specific question of where our differentiation lies, the first one is hybrid. [SEP] The second point of differentiation is our focus on personalization and customization, allowing our customers to tailor their experience to their unique needs and preferences.","679":"We're excited about our progress over the past quarter and our ability to maintain momentum in our market. [SEP] because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth. [SEP] Additionally, our recent acquisitions and partnerships have positioned us well to expand our offerings and provide even greater value to our customers.","680":"Now, let's talk about our gaming division. [SEP] But before I get to streaming, the thing that I'll say is most critical when you think about gaming is having a platform where the gamers are already there. [SEP] That's why we're thrilled to have recently partnered with a major gaming company and are already seeing a significant increase in user engagement.","681":"As for mobile, we have seen strong growth in our user base. [SEP] But overall, we are seeing prices increase on mobile in region, so I think that's consistent with the reported trend. [SEP] However, we still face challenges in monetizing our mobile platform, particularly with regards to ad revenue.","682":"When it comes to gaming, we are always looking for ways to innovate and provide new experiences for our players. [SEP] So we have some high hopes for what we can achieve with engagement around Xbox Live across the console plus PC. [SEP] We have seen strong growth in our gaming division, and we believe the continued growth of Xbox Live engagement will be a driving force behind our success in the future.","683":"Thank you for joining us for our Q3 earnings call. Our company had a strong performance this quarter, driven primarily by our sales in the tech sector. [SEP] We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive, we're going to have of course better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. [SEP] However, we do anticipate some challenges in the December quarter due to a slowdown in consumer spending during the holiday season. We will continue to focus on optimizing our operational efficiency and building strategic partnerships to navigate this situation. Overall, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects and look forward to providing updates in our next earnings call.","684":"When asked about the company's streaming content strategy, the CEO responded that they are pleased with the results they are seeing. [SEP] So beyond the awards that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon, particularly our Amazon Originals, we feel that program is working. [SEP] Additionally, we have recently secured partnerships with several major networks to distribute their shows on our platform, further expanding our offerings to our subscribers.","685":"We'll now take our first question from Ross. [SEP] I mean, on the first question Ross as far as our premium services, just even on the application infrastructure side, for example, in compute, there is increasing need for things like IoT services. [SEP] And so we're continuing to invest in those areas to provide more and more options, not just for our existing clients, but for new clients that are coming in the door.","686":"Our marketing team has been exploring new channels to expand our customer base. [SEP] We think it's a great opportunity to reach customers who are already in a discovery mindset. [SEP] We'll be launching targeted ad campaigns on social media platforms to reach this audience.","687":"Moving on to questions from the analysts on the call. [SEP] On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business and you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. [SEP] However, we are always looking for ways to become more efficient and competitive, so we will continue to evaluate pricing strategies.","688":"We recognize that there are some challenges ahead, but we're confident that with the right strategies in place, we can continue to grow and succeed in the market. Now, I'd like to discuss some of the steps we're taking to achieve our goals. [SEP] So we're working on both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it. [SEP] Additionally, we're exploring new opportunities for expansion, both domestically and internationally. We're also streamlining our supply chain and exploring ways to reduce costs without sacrificing quality. Overall, we're confident that our investments in the business will position us for long-term success and profitability.","689":"During the third quarter, we saw strong growth in our sales and revenue, with a 12% increase year-over-year. [SEP] We also announced a Operations Center of Excellence to be opened up in Nashville, which is about -- estimated to be about 5000 jobs. [SEP] We are excited about this expansion and the potential it brings for our company, both in terms of job creation and improved operational efficiency.","690":"We have invested heavily in the development of our new technology platform. [SEP] This is a capability that's been multiple decades in the work, but here we are with very competitive total cost of ownership price competitiveness, but with a technology that is in many cases, as Gartner talks about, at the top of the charts when it comes to all of these workloads. [SEP] We are confident that our product will meet the needs and exceed the expectations of our customers.","691":"Now let's move on to our annual report and the metrics that we have been tracking. [SEP] So as we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. [SEP] This year, we have decided to include more detailed data on customer demographics and purchasing behaviors to help inform our marketing strategy.","692":"Our revenue for the second quarter came in at $500 million, which was a slight increase from the first quarter. [SEP] So we are starting to see as I mentioned in earlier calls that the investment will be stepping up in 2019, so started to see that in Q2. [SEP] We are confident that these investments will pay off in the long run and result in sustained growth for our company. As we move forward into the second half of the year, we will be closely monitoring our progress and making any necessary adjustments to our strategy.","693":"Our research and development team has been working hard to stay ahead of the curve and anticipate the needs of our customers. [SEP] And that means that there needs to be a whole range of new production tools and consumption experiences for enabling that. [SEP] We are confident that our investment in these new tools and experiences will pay off in increased revenue and customer satisfaction.","694":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our technology and stay ahead of the curve in our industry. [SEP] And in that modernizing phase, it's not just being modernized to live only in what is called a cloud, but it will also be modernized to live in the edge of the cloud. [SEP] This expansion to the edge of the cloud will allow for even greater flexibility and accessibility for our customers.","695":"We have been working diligently to improve the shipping times of our products globally. Our customers have been asking for faster delivery options and we want to meet their expectations. [SEP] But this is intended to be a global improvement in speed tied to our Prime program. [SEP] Through the Prime program, we have been able to offer significant benefits to our members, including free and fast shipping. We are confident that these improvements will enhance the overall customer experience and drive growth for our business.","696":"We have seen strong growth in our sales figures over the past year, and we are confident that this trend will continue. Despite some challenges in the market, our team has worked hard to ensure that we are delivering high-quality products and services to our customers. [SEP] Largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well. [SEP] Of course, we will continue to evaluate our strategy and make adjustments as necessary in order to stay ahead of the curve. However, I believe that our focus on providing exceptional value to our customers is our core strength, and it will be a key driver of our success going forward. Thank you for your time today, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.","697":"We made a significant investment in a new product line last year, and I'm pleased to report that it's paying off. Our team has worked tirelessly to bring this new line to market, and I couldn't be prouder of their efforts. [SEP] And the results have actually been better than we anticipated when we first made the investment. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're focused on continuing to grow this product line and exploring new opportunities in the market. We believe that our innovative approach and dedication to quality will set us apart from the competition, and we're excited to see what the future holds. Thank you all for your continued support and investment in our company.","698":"We've been closely monitoring user activity on our platform. [SEP] But certainly there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there which is looking for things that, over time, could be monetizable or commercial intent. [SEP] We'll continue to analyze this behavior and explore opportunities to generate revenue in a way that enhances user experience.","699":"Can you expand on your target market for this new product? [SEP] The initial market that we look at are all the people who have Xboxes, PlayStations, and Wiis, the people who are excited to have an immersive media experience sitting in their living room for a long period of time, and that's a pretty big market. [SEP] But beyond that, we see potential for our immersive media experience to reach a broader audience through partnerships with streaming services and smart TV manufacturers.","700":"Thank you for joining us today to discuss our company's latest earnings results. [SEP] Yes, we have had very strong growth the last two years and earlier, obviously on Prime growth of members. [SEP] However, we do anticipate some challenges in the coming quarters due to market competition and global economic conditions.","701":"We're really excited about the growth that we're seeing in our mobile products. Our team has been working hard to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for our users. [SEP] In some of the products, I would urge people to look at the Outlook Mobile experience and how really meaningful the experience is for the user and the member. [SEP] We believe that our mobile products will continue to be a major driver of growth for our company. With the increased focus on mobile usage, we're confident that our products will continue to exceed user expectations.","702":"Moving on to our Prime membership... [SEP] So we're really excited about the creative team we've assembled and the products that they've been able to bring to Prime customers. [SEP] We have seen significant growth in both user engagement and revenue in the past quarter as a result.","703":"Can you give us some insight into how you're allocating your AWS resources and capital expenditures? [SEP] Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth. [SEP] However, we also continue to invest in expanding our infrastructure to meet the needs of new customers that are coming on board, particularly in emerging markets where we see a lot of potential for growth.","704":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our Stories ads feature from our customers in the last quarter. [SEP] So if you look at some of the tools and products I\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters, now you can \u2013 rather than us saying to you, go make a Stories ad you can just send us some pictures, some text, some very easy posts and we will create some Stories ads for you. [SEP] This new feature has been very well-received by our customers and we have already seen a positive impact on our revenue growth. We will continue to invest in new tools and products to make advertising on our platform easier and more efficient for our customers.","705":"Our international expansion efforts have been a key focus for us over the past year. [SEP] We rolled out a lot of additional Prime features internationally as well this year, from FREE Same-Day to Prime Now to Prime Music and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. [SEP] We are very pleased with the positive response we have received from our international customers, and we will continue to invest resources into expanding our offerings in these markets.","706":"Over the past year, we have gone through a significant transformation. We have streamlined our operations, restructured our teams, and shifted our focus towards digital innovation. [SEP] We've tried to run the company in a way where we have -- we set up the infrastructure, and we set up the business models. [SEP] As a result of these efforts, we have seen strong revenue growth and improved profitability. However, we recognize that there is still work to be done, particularly in terms of optimizing our supply chain and expanding our customer base.","707":"We've had a great year of financial success, with record-breaking revenue and profitability. [SEP] And so that's what we're doing from a job growth point of view, and we're very, very proud of that. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are committed to continuing this positive trend and investing in our employees to drive even more job growth for years to come.","708":"Now, turning to our growth strategy for the year ahead. [SEP] The first is regulatory as you think about things like GDPR and other impacts and how those will be rolling out globally. [SEP] The second area we are closely monitoring is macroeconomic conditions and their potential implications for our business.","709":"Can you discuss your company's approach to software development frameworks? [SEP] We have real openness to all of the frameworks that you can call out to, and that something that we stay very attuned to come out which is we are not trying to fight some old battles. [SEP] Instead, we're focused on finding the most efficient and effective solutions for our customers' needs.","710":"I'd like to turn to our cloud infrastructure now. [SEP] Again, Keith, when we look at either the capital expense or the technical architecture, and the general approach we take is about all of our cloud. [SEP] We believe that this strategy will position us for long-term success in the increasingly competitive cloud market.","711":"We've seen tremendous growth in the video consumption on our platform. \n- Videos are now the most shared and engaged content on our platform. [SEP] And that's what we're trying to do with the video tab, to make it so that all the different folks, whether they're pages that you follow or creators that you like, who you want to subscribe to and get the updates to what they're doing, that you have a place that you can go to with more intent to consume that content. [SEP] We're also investing in video ad formats to make sure that we're delivering value to our advertisers and generating revenue for the company.\n- The feedback we've received so far from our users has been very positive about the video tab and we're excited about the new features we're adding in the coming months.","712":"Our user growth has been strong and steady over the past year, and we anticipate continued growth in the coming quarters. [SEP] So, yeah, we are investing ahead of user growth, given the long lead time in deploying data centers and network capacity. [SEP] However, we believe that these investments will position us well for long-term success and allow us to better serve our users and customers.","713":"We've had some challenges this quarter, but I'm proud of our team's hard work and dedication. We've been focused on delivering value to our customers and investing in our technology. [SEP] but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality, that is the best thing for the customer and we work for the user. [SEP] As we move forward, we'll continue to prioritize the customer and user experience in all of our product decisions. We recognize that we have a lot of work to do, but I am confident in our ability to succeed. Thank you all for your continued support.","714":"During the quarter, our team continued to focus on improving our e-commerce offerings. [SEP] When you look at the Instagram Shopping experience, we're seeing some really nice growth. [SEP] We're excited about the potential for Instagram Shopping to continue driving revenue growth in the coming quarters.","715":"Now turning to our engagement metrics. [SEP] And I'd say the character of the engagement growth is a little bit different by region. [SEP] In North America, we're seeing a lot of new sign-ups and repeat customers, while in Asia, we're seeing more engagement from our existing user base.","716":"Now I\u2019d like to turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. [SEP] And then when it comes to how we\u2019re thinking about expense growth as we look beyond 2019, we\u2019re not providing specific guidance but I\u2019d note that we continue to invest aggressively across the business and there\u2019s no change in our long-term outlook on the need to invest heavily in areas like safety and security, innovation in our core product and infrastructure and the ultimate impact that those will have on our operating margin. [SEP] However, we\u2019re also focused on driving efficiencies and finding opportunities to streamline our operations, so we\u2019ll be working hard to strike the right balance between investing and managing costs over the long term.","717":"Our social media platforms continue to experience strong engagement levels as users seek to connect with each other and share their experiences through visual content. [SEP] We have 400 million people sharing with Instagram Stories, 450 million with WhatsApp Status. [SEP] As we continue to focus on enhancing user experience and expanding our reach, we remain optimistic about our ability to drive further growth and monetization opportunities across our platforms.","718":"We're constantly evaluating our marketing strategies to improve our customer engagement and generate more revenue. In the last quarter, we experimented with promoting our products on social media platforms. [SEP] And just the addition of Facebook Stories drove 26% more additions to their checkout cart. [SEP] We're also exploring other ways to leverage social media to drive sales. Our team is currently working on a partnership with Instagram to make our products more accessible to their users. We believe that social media advertising is a powerful tool that should be incorporated into any successful marketing campaign.","719":"We are now going to discuss the performance of our cloud services division. [SEP] So, our private cloud, premium cue mix is also growing you see that in our results. [SEP] In fact, we are planning to invest more in this area in the coming years to further expand our offerings.","720":"Our company has seen a significant shift towards cloud-based solutions in recent months. [SEP] I do believe that every conversation that we're having with customers is cloud-led. [SEP] As we continue to invest in our cloud offerings, we expect our conversations with customers to become even more cloud-focused in the future.","721":"During the last quarter, we saw strong growth and engagement across our platforms, both in established and emerging markets. [SEP] I mean, specifically we've made a lot of initiatives to help improve and invest in the Facebook experience in emerging markets and that has helped drive some of the acceleration in growth. [SEP] Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in emerging markets and leverage our technology to bring connectivity and economic opportunities to underserved communities.","722":"We have seen increasing interest in our product from customers and partners alike. [SEP] And I would imagine that that will come and contribute to our business through advertising in the way that it has historically. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new marketing tactics to further expand our reach and increase brand awareness.","723":"Now let's take a closer look at our revenue streams for the quarter. [SEP] And in fact, they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances. [SEP] Overall, we are satisfied with our performance this quarter and are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results in the future.","724":"I want to talk about some of the changes we made last year to improve our operations. [SEP] Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. [SEP] We found that these initiatives were successful in reducing processing times and increasing customer satisfaction, so we plan to continue working with FBA merchants to improve our fulfillment processes going forward.","725":"Moving on to user engagement, we are pleased to report that our Explore feature has continued to see strong usage. [SEP] More than 200 million people use Explore in order to see content that's interesting to them and interact with people beyond their friends and the people who are \u2013 who they follow directly. [SEP] We're constantly looking for ways to improve the Explore experience and provide our users with even more personalized content recommendations.","726":"Can you talk a little more about your process for determining what constitutes high quality content on your platform? [SEP] The reality is the way we've done this for years is we've had a panel, a survey of thousands of people who basically we asked what the most meaningful content is that they had seen on the platform or that they've seen off the platform and we design our systems in order to be able to get to that ground truth of what people \u2013 real people are telling us is that high quality experience. [SEP] Have you considered incorporating a more automated system for identifying and promoting high quality content?","727":"Thank you for the question. We appreciate your interest in our financials. [SEP] The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. [SEP] This reclassification has allowed us to better align our financial reporting with industry standards and provide investors with clearer insights into our operations.","728":"We have seen a strong growth in our customer base over the past quarter, and are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum. [SEP] So I think, that's a lot of \u2013 the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands. [SEP] Our team is also actively working on new initiatives to improve our customer experience and drive innovation in our industry.","729":"We're excited to share that in the past quarter, our team has really made some significant progress on our partnerships and collaborations. [SEP] We have deals going with Ford on powering the cars of the future, Lyft, Gogo, a lot of really good customer wins in the quarter. [SEP] We're looking forward to continuing to work with these companies and many others to bring our innovative solutions to as many customers as possible.","730":"We'd like to address some concerns that have been raised about a recent study related to our company's products. [SEP] On the specific report on this study, the study was conducted by a former employee with very incomplete data. [SEP] While we take all studies and reports seriously, we do not believe the conclusions drawn from this study are accurate or representative of the quality of our products.","731":"One analyst on the call had asked about the company's plans for potential partnerships in the coming year. [SEP] We\u2019re not hanging numbers out there to be measured on at this point, but we don\u2019t do a lot of big partnerships as you probably know. [SEP] Instead, the company typically focuses on developing its own products and technologies, with occasional strategic collaborations with smaller companies.","732":"One of the questions we often get from our investors and analysts is how much of our costs are coming from different regions we operate in. [SEP] So beyond that, we don\u2019t do geographic cost breakouts and allocations; it\u2019s not how we run the business. [SEP] Instead, we focus on identifying areas of improvement for our overall cost structure and efficiency across all regions, which ultimately benefits the entire company.","733":"One of the main drivers of our success this quarter has been our focus on our third party sellers. [SEP] And we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers and that\u2019s why you see the results that we're seeing today 44% of our units today, as of this quarter, our third party units, that\u2019s up about 400 basis points from last year. [SEP] We believe that our continued investments in seller tools and programs will only strengthen our third party marketplace and drive even further growth in the future.","734":"As we look at our advertising business, we continue to focus on providing high-quality ads that are relevant and useful to our users. One area where we have seen success in this effort is in our management of ad load and internal promotion units. [SEP] One thing that I would cite there, it's just how we manage ad load and balance some of our internal promotion units and sort of use it as internal house spend and the nature of the changes that we made in that had a more pronounced impact in some of the lower ARPU countries and unlocked more impression growth in those markets. [SEP] We believe that this approach not only benefits our users, but also helps our advertising partners to achieve their desired outcomes. Looking ahead, we plan to continue our focus on optimizing our advertising business to deliver the best possible outcomes for all stakeholders.","735":"We have seen a lot of changes in the advertising landscape over the past year. [SEP] The way the auction system works is going to just be whatever is the ad that is going to necessarily have the best return is going to win in the auction. [SEP] This means that advertisers need to constantly adapt and adjust their strategies to stay ahead of the competition.","736":"As we look ahead to the coming year, I want to take a moment to reflect on the impact that our acquisition of GitHub has had on our company. In many ways, it has been a transformative experience for us. [SEP] And quite frankly, primarily I'm excited because for us, as I've always said, GitHub is not a means to some other end. [SEP] Instead, GitHub is an integral part of our mission to empower developers and organizations to build the software solutions of the future. And as we continue to invest in this platform and expand its capabilities, we believe that it will continue to drive significant value for our shareholders and customers alike.","737":"Our global expansion efforts have continued to drive growth and innovation across all of our businesses.

[SEP] on pricing growth, I think there we feel like we're making good progress in our goal of driving better outcomes in ROI for our advertisers through things like better targeting, better ad units, driving better conversion, and improving measurement. [SEP] Our data also shows that engagement rates have improved significantly in the last quarter, which we view as a positive indicator of our efforts to improve ad quality.","739":"Now let's turn our attention to the growth in our sharing features. [SEP] As I said, the vast majority or the majority of the growth that we're seeing in sharing is coming from private messaging and story sharing. [SEP] We believe that the popularity of these features is a result of their ability to facilitate more intimate and personal connections between users.","740":"Our online advertising revenue on desktop has been impacted by ad blockers. [SEP] We're always going be in a back-and-forth with ad blockers on the desktop side. [SEP] However, we are exploring new strategies to combat this challenge and maintain our revenue growth.","741":"We have received questions about the total number of employees at Facebook and our partner companies. [SEP] So on the first one, the 10,000 number, that encompasses both employees at Facebook and also employees at partners, so it's not all Facebook employees. [SEP] We believe that partnerships are a key part of our business strategy, and we are proud to work with talented individuals from a variety of organizations.","742":"We have been closely monitoring our financial performance over the past quarter to determine areas where we can improve profitability. [SEP] Our primary consideration is always around maximizing gross margin dollars, and that is the approach that we take around for example pricing decisions. [SEP] However, we also prioritize providing value to our customers and maintaining competitive prices in the market.","743":"During the quarter, we generated strong cash flows of $5.4 billion. We returned a total of $7.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. [SEP] So the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends but we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily. [SEP] Our priority remains to create value for our shareholders, and we will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy. However, we believe that the current market conditions provide an attractive opportunity for us to continue buying back shares. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","744":"Now, let's take a closer look at our revenue breakdown.

[SEP] Overall, we're seeing a steady increase in subscription revenue year-over-year.","745":"One point I'd like to make is regarding the accounting impact we saw in the first quarter.

[SEP] Overall, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year financial targets and continue to drive growth in our core business.","746":"We have seen significant growth in our cloud offerings this quarter. [SEP] The concept of adding a lot of value by having and giving comfort to the customers that as they make a commitment to the Microsoft platform that they can move between a commitment to on-prem to the cloud in a high value way, I do believe is a unique thing that we offer at this time. [SEP] This is an important distinction from our competitors, as it allows for flexibility and scalability as businesses continue to evolve their technology needs.","747":"Our focus for the next quarter is on growing our user base and improving user engagement. [SEP] But we're going to invest as much in just making sure that we build out the community features around that. [SEP] By adding more social features to our platform, we hope to increase user loyalty and keep our community members actively using the platform for longer periods of time.","748":"We're excited to share with you today the early results from our recent product launch. As you all know, we recently unveiled our latest offering to the market, and we've been thrilled with the response so far. [SEP] The customer response from people that have gotten theirs over the weekend have been overwhelmingly positive, and we\u2019re far ahead of where we expected to be from an application point of view.

[SEP] However, we're still facing challenges with supply chain disruptions and shipping delays.","750":"So let's talk a little bit about our video strategy. As you all know, video has become an increasingly important part of our platform and we've been working hard to improve our offerings in this area. [SEP] On video, yeah, right now the strength in our system is definitely through helping people discover content that they hadn't really asked for through News Feed. [SEP] However, we see great potential in our video discovery features and believe that this will continue to drive growth in the coming quarters. We will also be investing in expanding our video content partnerships and improving the overall user experience through enhanced video playback technology.","751":"As we continue to expand our presence in China, we are seeing incredible growth in our developer community. [SEP] We have almost 2 million application developers in China that are writing apps for iOS and the App Store, and they're doing unbelievably creative work and innovative work. [SEP] Specifically, we've seen a 40% increase in the number of new developers joining our ecosystem over the past year.

[SEP] We believe that because we can do marketing to people and then measure results across what people do in privacy-protective ways, we have an ability to improve the relevance of marketing which will make it better for consumers and increase returns for marketers. [SEP] In fact, we have already seen a significant increase in click-through rates and engagement since implementing these new methods.","756":"We're really pleased with the progress we've made in our cloud computing division over the past year. [SEP] But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business. [SEP] That's a significant milestone for us and gives us great confidence in the future of this segment of our business.","757":"I'd like to now turn our attention to our data and AI initiatives. [SEP] So, for example, when we talk about data and AI close to data, because computation will always go wherever data is. [SEP] And by bringing computation close to data, we can significantly reduce processing time and ultimately provide a better experience for our customers.","758":"Let's talk about some of the innovative features we're introducing to our platform. [SEP] So, things that we're really excited about stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store.

We're now going to move on to our next caller on the line. [SEP] So the impression growth acceleration, you've got a couple factors going on there. [SEP] First, our marketing team has done an excellent job of expanding our reach to new audiences through targeted advertisements and social media campaigns. Additionally, we've seen an increase in user engagement with our platform thanks to the roll-out of new features and improvements to our user interface. Combined, these factors have contributed to a notable increase in impression growth over the past quarter.","760":"We have been closely monitoring the market and the industry trends. [SEP] Even on that -- our own demand for it, we don't see any change. [SEP] However, we will continue to keep an eye out for any shifts in demand and adjust accordingly.","761":"Now turning to our technology innovation efforts, I'm pleased to report that we've seen significant progress over the past quarter. [SEP] And I would say the rapid pace of innovation continues to stretch our lead in that dimension. [SEP] We remain committed to investing heavily in R&D in order to maintain our competitive advantage and continue delivering the most cutting-edge products and services to our customers.","762":"Our company recently conducted an extensive review of our financial performance and operating expenses. [SEP] We are concerned at this point about capital efficiency, returning price to customers periodically with price reductions and adding feature sets for them to make the business more valuable. [SEP] We are also exploring potential partnerships and acquisitions that can further enhance our offerings and value proposition to customers.","763":"We have seen significant growth in our video content in the past quarter. [SEP] Their video is making a big contribution to time spent growth, but we are not providing a specific stat on time spent growth on an ongoing basis.

[SEP] We believe these features and enhancements will greatly benefit our customers and improve their experience with our software.","771":"Our team has noticed some interesting trends in user behavior across different devices that we want to share with you today. [SEP] On desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos that they took from their digital camera and downloaded onto their computer; whereas on mobile, the more common behavior is to take a single photo or a couple and just post those. [SEP] This shift towards more frequent, but smaller uploads has impacted the way we design and develop our platform to better accommodate this behavior.","772":"We've been seeing a significant shift in the market towards cloud-based solutions.

[SEP] It's really about a transformation of the entire customer experience, including how they interact with our products and services.","773":"We've seen solid growth in our core business and have been able to maintain a strong margin. Looking ahead, however, there are a few areas of our portfolio that may require closer attention. [SEP] So while I'm confident in our ability to continue to grow the core margin, I do think for us in particular, it really is a portfolio that we believe that we need to manage appropriately. [SEP] We're constantly evaluating the performance of each segment of our business, and sometimes that means making tough decisions about where to allocate resources. But overall, I'm optimistic about our ability to navigate these challenges and continue delivering value to our customers and shareholders.","774":"We have been investing heavily in improving our content moderation system. [SEP] But ultimately, if you want to get those high-quality judgments today on sensitive content and you want to do it quickly when the stakes are pretty high in terms of taking down content or leaving things up, and we take that extremely seriously, you want people to be looking at that. [SEP] That's why we have a team of highly trained content moderators working around the clock to ensure that we get it right every time.","775":"We are pleased to report strong results for the holiday season. In particular, our digital marketing campaigns performed exceptionally well, driving significant traffic and sales.

We also utilized advanced targeting and optimization techniques to maximize the impact of our marketing spend. Overall, we exceeded our goals and are well-positioned for continued growth in the coming year.","776":"We have been seeing great results with the launch of our new iPhone model. I want to address concerns about the decline in unit sales this quarter. [SEP] So I have long believed that on 90 day clock on unit sales is a very surface way to view Apple. [SEP] As I have stated numerous times before, our focus is not on short-term gains, but rather on building long-term customer loyalty. This is why we focus on delivering superior customer experiences and providing innovative products. Our strong brand reputation and customer loyalty are what put us ahead of the competition and keep us relevant in the market.","777":"Our next question comes from John Smith, an analyst from ABC Investments. [SEP] But as I said, one of the key things is, architecturally, the way we build Azure, the way we build Office 365, the way we build our gaming cloud and the way we build even Dynamics are all pretty much one architecture. [SEP] This unification allows us to leverage the resources of each of these platforms to create a more seamless experience for our customers. It also enables us to innovate faster and deliver new features more efficiently. We believe this architecture will continue to be a significant competitive advantage for us as we look to grow our cloud business and expand our offerings across various industries.","778":"We've had a lot of success working with our clients over the past quarter, especially in driving sales and increasing brand awareness.

We believe these efforts will continue to drive strong results for our clients and help us maintain our position as a leader in the industry.","779":"As we move forward in Q2, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our costs.

[SEP] However, due to some unforeseen circumstances, we now believe that our transportation costs will be closer to $900 million.","780":"We recognize that home is becoming an increasingly important area for us to focus on. [SEP] Part of that is on HomePod but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad, and so I think home is important. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and improve our existing products and develop new ones, we're confident that we'll be able to meet the needs of our customers in the home market.","781":"Our team has been working tirelessly to improve the user experience on our platform. [SEP] If you go back a few years and you tried to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watched it, which wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared. [SEP] Today, we are proud to say that videos on our platform load almost instantly, making it the preferred method of sharing content for our users.","782":"Moving on to our financial performance, I want to highlight the growth we've seen in our subscription services. We've made significant investments in this area, and it's paying off. [SEP] So you'll see that, we reported subscription services revenue increased 26% when you exclude FX.

Overall, we feel good about the trajectory of this business and its potential for continued growth.","783":"In response to a question about market competition. [SEP] So look, I mean I think for all the concern about whether there is enough competition, the space today continues to be incredibly competitive. [SEP] We remain focused on differentiating our products and services to stay ahead of the competition and capture market share.","784":"We have seen some questions from investors regarding our foreign exchange adjusted average revenue per user (ARPU) growth rate. [SEP] So on the FX adjusted ARPU growth, I would just really point to the overall revenue growth rate, that's what's driving it. [SEP] Our team is constantly monitoring foreign exchange rates and adjusting our strategies accordingly to continue to drive revenue growth.","785":"When we look at our sales performance for the past year, there are several factors that contributed to our growth. [SEP] One of them is the fact that last year in January we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent channel sale for China Mobile. [SEP] Additionally, we saw strong demand for our products in emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia.","786":"We've been steadily transitioning our services to cloud-based platforms for the past few years. [SEP] When we start to get to this point and the percentage we already have in the cloud, it is really an offset. [SEP] In fact, we're seeing significant cost savings now that we've shifted the majority of our workload to the cloud.","787":"Can you talk about how your ad targeting and placement strategies have evolved across different Facebook platforms? For example, how do you approach ad placement in News Feed versus Instagram? [SEP] So the right ad in News Feed is different than the right ad in an Instagram or a Facebook story is different than the right ad in Watch, which would be video-only.

We continue to see great demand for our iPhone lineup, with our latest model performing particularly well. [SEP] It's the fact that we are having the iPhone SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a downward pressure on ASP. [SEP] However, we anticipate that the iPhone SE will attract a different segment of the market, one that is more price-sensitive. While this may impact our average selling price, we believe that it will also help us to expand our customer base and drive overall sales growth. Additionally, we are confident that our upcoming product launches will help to offset any potential decrease in ASP.","792":"Our company has always been committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, and we've taken steps to ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR. In fact, we see GDPR as an opportunity to build trust with our customers by being transparent about our data practices.

[SEP] Of course, there are challenges to implementing GDPR-like regulations on a global scale, and we'll need to work with regulators and industry leaders to make it happen. But we believe that this is the right direction for our industry, and we're committed to leading the way in data privacy and security. Thank you for your time today.","793":"We have been making significant investments in our productivity suite of products. [SEP] But I think I look at this and say, at a 37% growth rate, plus some of the integrations we've seen and the growth in uses and users of things like Outlook Mobile, I believe that we're probably a little bit on the front end of the revenue synergies you'll see in product over time. [SEP] We are optimistic about the potential for continued growth and revenue synergies as we expand our product offerings and enhance the user experience.","794":"Our advertising revenue has been increasing steadily over the past few quarters. However, we still have some room for improvement in this area. [SEP] So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space. [SEP] We have a few initiatives in place to improve our advertising revenue, such as partnering with more advertisers and utilizing data analytics to optimize ad placements. We are confident that these efforts will lead to positive results for our business.","795":"We've been seeing some impressive growth numbers recently, particularly in our ad revenue.

These efforts will allow us to continue offering high-quality services while still keeping our commitment to accessibility and affordability. We believe that by focusing on these principles, we can create a world where connectivity and communication are universally accessible to all.","800":"We take user safety very seriously on our platform and continuously evaluate how we can improve. [SEP] And at the end of the day, there's also policy and you're in a community and we have community standards for how we think people should communicate in order to be safe. [SEP] Our team regularly reviews and updates our policies to ensure that they align with our commitment to creating a safe and inclusive online environment.","801":"During the past quarter, we have seen a decline in user engagement on our platform. [SEP] So, it was really important to me, and I think to making \u2013 to the long term of what our product stands for it to make sure that News Feed is always about meaningful interaction. [SEP] We have been working on implementing changes to our algorithm to prioritize posts from friends and family and limit the visibility of clickbait and fake news.","802":"We're really excited about the progress we've made in our advertising business. We've seen strong growth in both our number of advertisers and total ad impressions. [SEP] As we connect more advertisers with those and bring more data into the system and we can get more of the impressions that are very highly targeted and very relevant, then we'll be rewarded with better pricing as we can expand that out into things like Lookalikes. [SEP] Our team is focused on continuously improving our data and targeting capabilities to drive better results for our advertisers. And as we continue to innovate and expand our offerings, we believe we'll be well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing shift towards digital advertising.","803":"Thank you for joining us for our earnings conference call. I would like to start by providing an overview of our Q2 financial results. [SEP] We did a little better in the quarter than I expected, but inventory levels are a little higher. [SEP] We are focusing on reducing our inventory levels in the coming quarter to optimize our cash flow and improve our margins. Despite the inventory challenge, I am pleased with the progress we have made in our cost-saving initiatives and our ability to adapt to the current market conditions. Thank you for your time today and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.","804":"We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our customers' data, and we will continue to work closely with regulators and policymakers to achieve this goal. [SEP] But in terms of for the market overall, I just think it would be a lot better if we had a very clear set of rules at the federal level on privacy. [SEP] This is not only important for our business and our customers, but for the entire industry as a whole. We believe that a consistent and transparent framework for data privacy is essential for building trust and promoting innovation in the digital economy. We will continue to advocate for such a framework in our discussions with lawmakers and other stakeholders.","805":"During the quarter, we invested a lot of resources into improving our camera features on our platform. We wanted to offer our users the best possible experience when capturing and sharing their favorite moments. [SEP] So we were competing there with things like Facebook camera, but we ultimately thought that we were going to do better work if we were building with Instagram. [SEP] Our decision to focus on Instagram has paid off. We've seen significant growth in user engagement and have received positive feedback on our camera updates. We will continue to prioritize improving our camera and other key features on Instagram to meet the evolving needs of our users.","806":"Moving on to our marketing strategies for the quarter, we've had some exciting developments on both the digital and brand side.

[SEP] So we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3. [SEP] And can you provide any updates on how the sales team is approaching upselling current customers to E3?","808":"Can you tell us about your new product development strategy? [SEP] And rather than just relying on our own intuition, although we do rely on that a lot, we will try to put it out in the market and get feedback and then roll it out from there. [SEP] Do you have any specific examples of times when this approach has led to successful product launches?\" \n\n\"And rather than just relying on our own intuition, although we do rely on that a lot, we will try to put it out in the market and get feedback and then roll it out from there. By doing this, we're able to get a more accurate read on what customers want and are willing to pay for. It also helps us identify any potential issues early on and make necessary adjustments before wide-scale launch.","809":"Our company has been closely monitoring user-generated content on our platform and its impact on the community. [SEP] The reactive model of waiting for people in the community to flag them guarantees that by the time that we get to look at an issue someone has already seen that content, which is not the state that we want to be in. [SEP] To address this concern, we are implementing an AI-based content moderation system that proactively identifies problematic content and removes it before it reaches a wider audience.","810":"We've received a lot of questions regarding our plans for expanding our network. I want to assure our shareholders that we are actively working towards that goal. [SEP] On the other part of your question, we continue to work on the network around the world, but I can't respond to any of the rumors and speculation. [SEP] However, we have to consider a multitude of factors before making any announcements. These include regulatory approvals, market demand, and investment costs. Rest assured, our team is diligently working on a plan that will benefit both our company and our customers.","811":"During the last quarter, we saw a significant increase in demand for our products. [SEP] The guidance is $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and that's up from $1.8 billion last year. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue and are confident in our ability to meet or exceed our guidance for the year.","812":"Our team has been closely monitoring user behavior on our platform. [SEP] In the US, I think it was less video and more core feed engagement. [SEP] This is encouraging as it aligns with our strategy to focus on building deeper connections and engagement between users.","813":"Now I'd like to turn to our business segment performance. [SEP] It's really as we talked about transactional weakness in Productivity and Business Process. [SEP] However, we are seeing strong growth in our Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing sectors, which is offsetting some of the weakness in Productivity and Business Process.","814":"We've seen a lot of growth in our advertising revenue this quarter, but we are also excited about the potential of our subscription-based content offerings. [SEP] And now the third class of content, which I think is going to be important and increasingly important over time is the one that you basically want to essentially trade the content for money, and that is one where you need the rev share to unlock that. [SEP] We are working on developing more exclusive content that will fit into this category and provide a valuable revenue stream for our company.","815":"We have shifted the focus of our advertising strategy to more targeted marketing efforts. [SEP] because when they're more targeted, they have higher returns for marketers and they're more enjoyable or relevant for people. [SEP] As a result, we have seen a significant increase in engagement and conversion rates from our advertising campaigns.","816":"Analyst: \"Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to circle back on the guidance for the upcoming quarters. Given the recent industry trends and the pandemic, are you seeing anything new that could impact your outlook? [SEP] And so I'm not sure there's anything quote-unquote new, Karl, I would say, other than that bit of mix between OEM Pro, a little bit pulled into Q2 versus Q3. [SEP] CEO: \"Overall, we remain confident in our financial outlook for the year. We're seeing strong demand for our products across multiple sectors. In fact, we just closed a major deal with a Fortune 500 company to provide our software solution for their entire workforce. This will have a positive impact on our revenue starting in Q4. And so I'm not sure there's anything quote-unquote new, Karl, I would say, other than that bit of mix between OEM Pro, a little bit pulled into Q2 versus Q3.","817":"Let's now turn to our robotics division for an update. [SEP] At the end of 2014, we had 15,000 bots, so we've doubled that amount and they were in 10 warehouses. [SEP] Our goal for next year is to expand our bot fleet to 40,000 and have them operating in 20 warehouses.","818":"Our financial results for this quarter have been impressive, with revenue growth exceeding our expectations. [SEP] The infrastructure team has done an outstanding job in driving good efficiencies through things like the Open Compute Project, which allows us to leverage an open-source strategy to lower our costs on server and other expensive hardware. [SEP] As we continue to focus on cost reduction efforts, we remain committed to finding innovative solutions that help us scale while keeping expenses in check.","819":"We've received a lot of feedback from our customers regarding their desire for more flexibility and convenience in purchasing our products. [SEP] That's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call and so we are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today. [SEP] We believe that offering recurring payment options and easier access to new products will ultimately drive greater customer loyalty and increase sales for our company.","820":"We've seen really strong growth in our e-commerce division this quarter. [SEP] Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. [SEP] We're excited to continue supporting Souq's expansion and growth in the region.","821":"We've seen remarkable growth in our online sales platform over the past year,\" the CEO reported to investors during the earnings conference call. [SEP] And then, not stopping there, but going to other devices, for example mobile. [SEP] Our team has been working diligently to optimize our mobile app, which we believe will be an important driver of revenue growth in the years to come,\" the CEO continued.","822":"We're very pleased with the performance of our Xbox business this quarter. It's been a standout performer for us and we continue to see strong demand for our consoles and content. [SEP] So when you see some of the KPIs and some of the strength you saw in quarter, that's the foundation of Xbox. [SEP] We're also excited about the upcoming launch of our new Xbox Series X console later this year. We believe it will be a game-changer for the industry and we're confident it will further strengthen our position in the market.","823":"We will now take a question from the audience. [SEP] Next, I think across every service the momentum we\u2019ve seen in Q4 and in particular, I would say, I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows E5, advanced threat protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings. [SEP] Can you provide any details on what specific areas you are seeing the most growth in?","824":"In terms of competition, we continue to monitor the market closely and remain focused on delivering quality products and services to our customers. We understand that pricing is an important consideration for consumers, but it is not the only factor. [SEP] While pricing is certainly a factor we don't believe it's always the primary factor [SEP] Our research has shown that customers also value convenience, reliability, and customer service. Therefore, we strive to provide a well-rounded experience that meets all of these needs. By focusing on these key areas, we have been able to maintain a loyal customer base and attract new ones, despite the competitive landscape.","825":"We understand that there may be concerns regarding our performance and growth in China recently. [SEP] Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future. [SEP] We are committed to investing in this market and are exploring new strategies to increase our presence and appeal to Chinese consumers.","826":"We are closely monitoring geopolitical risks as they may impact our business operations globally. [SEP] There are big elections, not just the U.S. midterms, but the major elections upcoming in Mexico, in Brazil, in India, and Pakistan, and a number of other countries around the world. [SEP] We have developed contingency plans to mitigate potential disruption to our supply chains and production facilities. Despite these uncertainties, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects and are committed to delivering value to our shareholders.","827":"We have seen some great growth over the last few quarters, and I know many of you are interested in the details behind that growth. [SEP] Yeah, what I can tell you is that yes, the unit growth has been reaccelerated in the last two quarters and actually Amazon Fulfilled unit growth is growing at a higher clip. [SEP] We are confident that this growth trend will continue, and we believe there are still many untapped opportunities for us to pursue. With the support of our dedicated team and our commitment to innovation, we are excited to see what the future holds for our company.","828":"I'd now like to turn our attention to our efforts to improve user engagement and increase revenue. [SEP] But we continue to make changes to improve and to optimize around driving meaningful social interactions as Mark talked about. [SEP] We believe these changes will not only benefit our users, but also result in sustained growth for our platform.","829":"As we look towards the future, let's discuss the impact of the current trade tensions on our business outlook. [SEP] On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press. [SEP] However, we must remain cautious as these tensions can escalate quickly and have a significant effect on our bottom line.","830":"We have seen strong performance in Q3 and are optimistic that we can carry that momentum into the final quarter. [SEP] So that\u2019s a little bit more on our guidance, but again we are really looking forward to Q4. [SEP] We have several exciting product launches planned for Q4 and believe they will have a positive impact on our revenue.","831":"We have been closely monitoring our performance metrics and are pleased to report some exciting developments. [SEP] That is really showing a lot of good traction for us, but we're also seeing traction in analytics and voice. [SEP] Our team has been working diligently to optimize these areas and we are seeing some promising results.","832":"Our sales team has been actively working on identifying ways to increase sales of lower ASP items. We have been experimenting with different strategies over the past six months. [SEP] So you know there has been some reduction in the threshold for some lower ASP items that we\u2019ve been doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, especially over the long term. [SEP] Our goal is not just to increase sales in the short term, but to also ensure customer satisfaction in the long term. We believe that by reducing the threshold for lower ASP items, we are making our offerings accessible to a wider range of customers and meeting their needs.","833":"Moving onto our financial results for this quarter... [SEP] In terms of what drove the improvement in the pricing, it's strong demand, so that's playing through in the face of a little bit slower supply growth. [SEP] We are also optimistic about our future outlook as we continue to see positive trends in the market.","834":"We have some exciting projects in the pipeline that we believe will drive growth for our company. [SEP] And we think with the cash flow that we're generating, we have a strong financial position with which to fund that. [SEP] Additionally, we plan to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that will complement our current offerings and support our long-term goals.","835":"We are seeing strong demand for our products and services, particularly in the online retail space. [SEP] So it's -- that increase in one-day shipping and all the associated cost of additional transportation and getting capacity in place. [SEP] However, we believe that the investments we are making in this area will ultimately lead to greater customer satisfaction and retention, as we strive to provide faster and more convenient delivery options.","836":"Our iPhone upgrade program has been a huge success and has helped to drive growth in our subscriber base. [SEP] There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans, where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. [SEP] Despite increased competition in this area, we are confident in our ability to maintain our market position and continue to offer innovative products and services to our customers.","837":"We have seen strong revenue growth in the past quarter due to our strategic pricing and marketing efforts. [SEP] Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. [SEP] However, we continue to explore options for expanding our first-party sales to states that do not have a state-imposed sales tax.","838":"During the last quarter, our advertising revenue increased by 10%, which is a reflection of our ongoing efforts to improve our advertising strategies. [SEP] But obviously, if you have rising prices, it's going to make that work against an upstream trend, so we need to continue to work hard to deliver more value for advertisers in the face of that. [SEP] We are also exploring new ways to improve our ad targeting capabilities and provide more personalized ads to users, which we believe will further drive advertising revenue growth in the future.","839":"As we discuss our quarterly results, I would like to draw your attention to some important updates related to our accounting policies. We have recently adopted a new revenue recognition standard, which has resulted in some changes to our financial reporting. [SEP] Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. [SEP] However, we believe that the impact of this change is minor and will not have a material effect on our financial performance over the long term. In fact, we are confident that our revenues will continue to grow steadily in the coming quarters, driven by strong demand for our products and services. Thank you for your attention, and now I will turn it over to our CFO to provide more details on our financial results.","840":"We have seen a tremendous increase in demand for our Prime platform over the last few quarters. [SEP] And again, so we're going to continue feed the Prime platform as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories. [SEP] Our goal is to ensure that Prime members have access to the widest selection of products and services possible.","841":"Our company has always placed great emphasis on innovation and staying ahead of the curve.\n- As we continue to grow and evolve as a business, we recognize the need to stay competitive in the tech marketplace.\n- In the past, we relied heavily on third-party vendors and contractors for our technology needs. [SEP] We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make. [SEP] By developing more of our technology in-house, we can ensure that our products and services are built to our precise specifications and standards.\n- We're also able to respond more quickly to changes in the market and customer needs, rather than waiting for third-party providers to make updates or adjustments.\n- We're excited about the potential of our in-house technology team and the contributions they'll make to our overall success.","842":"Our advertising team has been working tirelessly to expand our reach and increase our return on investment. [SEP] Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook Pixels to measure the incremental sales, and got to a 9.7 times return on ad sales. [SEP] We are thrilled with these results and will continue to seek out new opportunities to connect with our target audience.","843":"We were able to successfully expand into several new international markets this quarter. Our international team worked hard to conduct thorough research into each market and develop localized strategies. [SEP] And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe our efforts to adapt our pricing strategy to each unique market paid off in increased revenue and customer loyalty. Moving forward, we plan to continue taking this approach as we consider further expansion into new markets.","844":"One of the questions we received a lot is about how our sales are doing in China. [SEP] I would also say, it's not all about iPhone in China, the services area grew double digit. [SEP] Our team in China has been doing a fantastic job of developing and promoting our services like Apple Music and iCloud, which have seen strong adoption rates among Chinese consumers.","845":"We've had a lot of success with our Prime Now service. [SEP] Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. [SEP] It allows us to quickly enter new markets and offer customers a faster delivery option.","846":"We've been investing heavily in our data analytics capabilities, building out our product catalog, and improving our site and app interfaces to make them more user-friendly. [SEP] But what our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. [SEP] We're also exploring opportunities to expand our offerings into new and complementary product categories that align with our customers' interests and preferences. By doing so, we hope to deepen our relationship with them and drive greater lifetime customer value.","847":"Our team has been working diligently to optimize costs without sacrificing performance. We understand that cloud consumption can be a significant expense, which is why we are thrilled to announce this news today. [SEP] In fact, you can think of it as a price cut for anybody who cares about being very, very smart about cloud consumption [SEP] This price cut is only one example of our commitment to providing our customers with value and savings. We will continue to innovate and find new ways to improve efficiency and lower costs on the cloud. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our company.","848":"Our sales team has been working tirelessly to promote and push the iPhone X to our customers. [SEP] But I would tell you that we\u2019re thrilled with the reception of iPhone X. [SEP] We've seen a significant uptick in sales and customer satisfaction surveys indicate that users are extremely pleased with their iPhone X experience.","849":"I want to take a moment now to discuss our advertising revenue growth for Q2. [SEP] So what you're seeing in our results right now are very strong growth for Facebook and very strong growth for Instagram. [SEP] We're seeing an increasing number of businesses utilizing Instagram to connect with their customers, which is contributing significantly to our overall revenue growth.","850":"We are excited to announce the release of our latest product, which we believe will revolutionize the market. [SEP] It is a new product for us, and with any kind of new product, you wind up taking some time to fully ramp. [SEP] However, we are confident that once we have fully ramped up, this product will exceed our expectations and become a key source of revenue for the company.","851":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. I am pleased to report that we exceeded our earnings expectations, with a net income of $1.2 billion. [SEP] But its $800 -- excuse me $800 million lower depreciation expense in the quarter and it will be consistent. [SEP] This decrease in depreciation expense is largely due to our recent investment in upgraded equipment and technology, which has increased our efficiency and reduced the need for costly maintenance. We expect this trend to continue, providing a valuable cost savings for our company in the coming quarters.","852":"Thank you for that question. We've noticed some changes in our sales cycles recently, particularly in the cloud segment. [SEP] Now over any short-term period, the majority of what we have seen is really either a budget constraint, a macroeconomic change, or people, to the question you've laid out, maybe in the midst of making their cloud transition plan, and maybe that has elongated the sales cycle to an extent. [SEP] However, we're confident that our long-term strategy is on track and we will continue to see growth in this area. We are working closely with our customers to help them navigate their cloud transition plans and are seeing positive results as a result of these efforts.","853":"We have received a lot of questions about our plans for monetizing WhatsApp, so I'd like to address that now. [SEP] We are not rolling out any monetization products on WhatsApp right now, but we did start that process at F8 on Messenger. [SEP] We believe that it's important to approach monetization in a thoughtful way that respects user privacy and ensures that our products enhance the overall user experience.","854":"Can you talk about the impacts on your bottom line of adding new capacity to the network? [SEP] But on the cost side, yes it\u2019s going to be the route density and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down, but for now, there is certainly some start-up paying in adding new capacity. [SEP] However, we believe that this investment is necessary to meet the growing demand for our services and ultimately drive long-term profitability.","855":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the use of our messaging apps, particularly WhatsApp. The number of users who made voice and video calls on WhatsApp also continued to grow. [SEP] And I think that that's just going to continue growing and I'm really looking forward to getting the first stats on WhatsApp VoIP as well soon. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters as more people work and communicate remotely. Additionally, we are exploring ways to monetize our messaging platforms, including potentially offering paid features or advertisements, which could further drive revenue growth.","856":"We've been focused on innovation and investing in our products for the long term. [SEP] If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to deliver new features and capabilities that we think our customers are going to love.","857":"We've had some questions from investors about how we plan to continue growing our revenue in such a competitive advertising market. [SEP] And so what's really most important in winning budgets is our relative performance versus other opportunities presented to marketers. [SEP] We're confident that our unique targeting capabilities and innovative ad formats will continue to differentiate us from the competition and drive strong results for our clients.","858":"We're excited about the progress we've made over the past quarter and the opportunities ahead of us. One area we see strong potential in is our business application segment. [SEP] And I think about the combination of both Dynamics 365 as well as what we're doing on the LinkedIn side. [SEP] The integration of Dynamics 365 with LinkedIn's Sales Navigator has yielded positive results for our customers. We're constantly looking at ways to further leverage the strengths of both platforms to drive growth and create value for our stakeholders.","859":"We're excited to announce that we've reached over 2 billion monthly active users across our platforms. [SEP] So that's countries like India and Mexico and Brazil and Indonesia, which will make up a large part of the community on WhatsApp. [SEP] Our focus this year will be on improving our privacy and security features, especially in these rapidly growing markets.","860":"We've been looking at ways to enhance our platform and make it more intuitive for our users. [SEP] And I wouldn't expect anything here to launch soon, but this is definitely something that we're thinking about and that I think will improve the user experience. [SEP] We plan to continue exploring this idea and gathering feedback from our users to determine the best approach.","861":"Now let's discuss our performance in the Pro OEM segment. [SEP] It is a lower RPL than our traditional non-Pro OEM licenses, but I do believe it drove meaningful ecosystem health and as well drove good competitive dynamics in the channel. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with the results and plan to continue our focus on building a strong Pro OEM ecosystem.","862":"On the topic of Prime benefits, can you speak to the success of the Whole Foods discount program? [SEP] I would say that we're very - it's widespread and more Prime members have adopted the Whole Foods benefit than almost any other benefit we've offered them, and they're saving, as a result, hundreds of millions of dollars. [SEP] Do you anticipate any changes or updates to the Whole Foods benefit in the future?","863":"We've seen great success with our ad products over the past quarter and are excited to continue our focus on improving the user experience. [SEP] And that shows how you can use our ad products to go all the way from awareness, measuring through to a sale and show how important our ads can be to commerce on our platform. [SEP] Our team is constantly working to analyze user data and optimize our ad targeting to ensure the highest possible return on investment for our advertising partners.","864":"Moving onto our product lines, let's start with Watch. [SEP] So for Watch, the big thing that we're trying to do is help create new ways that people can connect, right? [SEP] We really believe that there are opportunities for us to innovate and bring people closer together through this platform. \n\n\"So for Watch, the big thing that we're trying to do is help create new ways that people can connect, right? We know that people are increasingly turning to social media to interact with each other, and we want to be at the forefront of that trend. We really believe that there are opportunities for us to innovate and bring people closer together through this platform. That's why we've been investing heavily in new features and functionality for Watch, and we're excited to see what the future holds.","865":"We have noticed an increase in customer adoption of our Azure services in recent months. [SEP] So we definitely see that path of -- where they're adopting the layers of Azure. [SEP] Our team is continuing to work on expanding the capabilities and offerings within Azure to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","866":"We'd now like to open the call up to questions from analysts and investors. [SEP] And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market, but given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone, but iPad as well. [SEP] We're confident in our company's direction and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders.","867":"We are constantly exploring ways to enhance the customer experience and drive growth in our business.\n- Over the past few months, we have seen a surge in demand for grocery and household essentials.\n- Our teams have been working hard to ensure that we can meet this increased demand while also delivering quality products and services. [SEP] So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers and we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. [SEP] One model we are considering is partnering with local farms and vendors to offer more fresh and locally sourced produce.\n- Additionally, we are experimenting with new delivery methods, including same-day and contactless delivery, to make shopping with us even more convenient for our customers.\n- As we test these different models and gather feedback from our customers, we will continue to iterate and evolve our approach to ensure that we are meeting their needs and staying ahead of the competition.","868":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our performance and our ability to navigate a challenging market environment. We saw strong growth in our digital business and were able to continue our cost-saving initiatives. [SEP] so -- and there is the impact that we would see during the course of the year. [SEP] We are optimistic about the coming year and believe that our focus on innovation and customer experience will drive continued success. Of course, there are still uncertainties in the market and potential challenges ahead. We will remain diligent in managing our resources and adapting to changing conditions. Thank you for joining us today.","869":"When it comes to ad load, we're constantly looking for ways to optimize our platforms. [SEP] so there is an opportunity for us to continue to grow ad load on Instagram probably beyond \u2013 in a longer timeframe than there is on Facebook because of that disparity in terms of where they are today. [SEP] Of course, we want to be careful not to compromise user experience, but we believe we can find a sweet spot that benefits both our advertisers and our community.","870":"We've had a great quarter and I'm thrilled to share our results with you today. [SEP] And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. [SEP] We're fully committed to continuing to drive growth and innovation in the coming months and years.","871":"Now let's talk a bit about our Q2 financial performance. [SEP] So we're thrilled with the results as to what's driving it it's the totality that's driving it. [SEP] We believe that our continued focus on innovation, coupled with our strong relationships with our customers, will keep us on this positive trajectory.","872":"Can you give us some insight into your company's strategy for hybrid computing? [SEP] When I think about hybrid computing at least in the fullness of time, it's more the future of distributed computing, where there is a cloud, there is an edge. [SEP] And how do you see your company positioning itself in this future landscape of distributed computing?","873":"As we continue to innovate and improve our products and services, we are embracing emerging technologies to enhance the customer experience. [SEP] And certainly AI is going to be a big part of that both on the vision side and the voice side. [SEP] We have invested heavily in research and development to integrate AI into our platform, and we believe this will further differentiate us from our competitors.","874":"A question from an analyst on the call asked about the company's ability to personalize content recommendations for users based on their interests. [SEP] But there's no reason that we shouldn't be able to match you up with any of the millions of pieces of content that you might be interested in that gets shared on Facebook every day, except for the fact that we don't have the AI technology to know what those are about and if they match your interest today. [SEP] However, our team is working diligently to develop and implement AI technology that will not only identify interests but also tailor recommendations based on user behavior and activity.","875":"During the quarter, we experienced a decline in our overall sales, particularly in our key markets. [SEP] Then of course, I would say by far the largest impact on margins for the quarter is the loss of leverage, which as we've discussed is a result of lower sales volumes. [SEP] To address this, we are implementing cost-cutting measures and exploring new growth opportunities to regain our leverage and improve our margins in the coming quarters.","876":"Our company has been exploring different avenues for expansion, and we believe that there is a huge potential in the market for virtual reality (VR) technology. Today, we want to share our plans with you regarding our VR platform. [SEP] In terms of the actual content, first, we think gaming is going to be the most obvious market. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to develop a range of immersive experiences that are specifically designed for VR gaming. We believe that this market has enormous potential for growth, particularly as the technology becomes more widely accessible. In fact, we're already seeing strong demand for our platform from gamers all over the world.","877":"We have seen a significant shift in our cost structure over the last year, which has impacted our financial performance. However, we have also made strategic investments in key areas that we believe will drive growth in the long-term. [SEP] And so you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a year-over-year basis where again, we have the reality of new cost structures into our products. [SEP] We continue to monitor the market closely and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that our cost structure remains competitive. Overall, we are pleased with our progress and are confident that we are well-positioned for future success. Thank you for your continued support.","878":"We have seen some growth in emerging markets, particularly in India and China, which is promising. [SEP] On India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade. [SEP] This is why we are continuing to invest in our operations in India and expand our reach in the region.","879":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings conference call. Our results this quarter have exceeded our expectations, and we're excited to share our progress with you. [SEP] And as far as the used cases, right now it\u2019s actually pretty diversified. [SEP] We're seeing a lot of traction in the healthcare sector, where our technology is being used to streamline processes and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, we've had success in the logistics industry, where our platform has helped increase efficiency and reduce costs. Overall, we're pleased with the diversity of our use cases and look forward to exploring new opportunities in the future.","880":"We're always looking for new ways to grow our business and improve the customer experience. [SEP] And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well. [SEP] As we continue to expand, we're confident that we can maintain the high level of service that our customers have come to expect.","881":"Our revenue growth has been strong this quarter, and we have sufficient cash reserves to consider a stock buyback. However, we want to be cautious and strategic in our actions. [SEP] We want to make sure that we buy back the stock at the right time. [SEP] Our financial team is analyzing market trends and stock performance to determine the optimal timing for a buyback. We understand the importance of maximizing shareholder value and will proceed with diligence and transparency.","882":"Our strategy moving forward is to diversify our revenue streams and expand our customer base. [SEP] And then, I guess, we're very focused on serving brands as well. [SEP] We have plans to establish partnerships with leading brands in various industries to ensure that we are meeting the ever-evolving needs of our customers.","883":"Now turning to our financial performance in 2019. [SEP] That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020. [SEP] Our team has done a great job of executing on our strategic priorities, and we are well-positioned for continued growth in the coming year.","884":"We have seen significant growth in our market share in the last quarter. [SEP] And so we will continue to push that differentiation because I think that view architecturally and the delivery of it is what makes us pretty unique. [SEP] Our team is constantly exploring new ways to innovate and improve our technology to better serve our customers.","885":"We've had a great quarter and we're excited about the momentum we're seeing across all of our business segments. Our team has been working hard to identify areas where we can continue to grow and innovate, and we're already seeing some promising results. [SEP] Where there's significant room left \u2013 and we're not just standing still in terms of adding value for new segments, so those are all in play. [SEP] One area where we're particularly excited is in our international markets. We're seeing strong demand for our products and services in many countries where we haven't yet fully penetrated the market. Additionally, we're constantly exploring new partnerships and collaborations that will help us bring even more value to our customers. Overall, we're optimistic about the opportunities ahead and we're committed to staying ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and growth.","886":"We're now going to discuss our strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] An importantly for our business, is connect the dots between online marketing and business outcomes. [SEP] In order to achieve this, we have invested heavily in data analytics tools that can help us determine the exact impact of our online marketing campaigns on our bottom line.","887":"Now I want to dive into our operating expenses for the past few years. Starting with fulfillment costs... [SEP] Starting with fulfillment costs, so in the prior two years, 2016, and 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfilment and shipping by greater than 30%. [SEP] This led to increased expenses for us, but also allowed for greater efficiency in delivering products to our customers. However, in 2018, we made a conscious effort to slow down this growth and focus on optimizing our existing fulfillment centers. As a result, we saw a slight dip in square footage growth tied to fulfillment and shipping, but a significant decrease in fulfillment costs.","888":"One of the key markets we're really excited about is India. [SEP] And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. [SEP] We've been working hard to establish a strong presence in the market, and we expect to see continued growth and success there in the coming years.","889":"One of the things we announced was that we're going to be doing a major overhaul of the News Feed algorithm and putting a lot more focus on social interaction, on content that people are interacting with. And we think that's going to be really good for the community, good for people on Facebook, and good for businesses ultimately. [SEP] But most people who come to News Feed and who come to Facebook today in general are trying figure out \u2013 they're trying to see what's going on with their friends, see what's happening in the world. [SEP] And so we're really optimistic about this change that we're making and the impact that it's going to have. We think it's going to increase engagement, increase time spent on the platform, and ultimately be better for the ecosystem overall. So we're really excited about what's coming next for Facebook and for the News Feed.","890":"We are thrilled to report another strong quarter and record-breaking sales for our iPhone lineup. The iPhone X launch has been highly anticipated and has exceeded our expectations. [SEP] And iPhone X has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the industry, and it is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start getting it in their hands. [SEP] The response from customers and critics alike has been overwhelmingly positive, and we believe the iPhone X sets a new standard for what a smartphone can be. We are confident that the iPhone X will continue to drive growth for our company and deliver a great user experience for our customers.","891":"We've had a strong quarter with solid revenue growth across all our business units. We've also made significant investments in optimizing our supply chain which has resulted in improved margins. [SEP] So clearly on that front, we've got a lot of projects that are going to need ongoing funding going into 2017, so that we've got good visibility on. [SEP] In addition to our ongoing projects, we will also be exploring potential partnerships and acquisitions to drive further growth and innovation. We will continue to prioritize investments that generate long-term value for our shareholders as we navigate the competitive landscape.","892":"When it comes to our AI capabilities, we are truly at the forefront of the industry. Our team of experts has developed cutting-edge algorithms and models that are driving significant value for our customers.

We are committed to investing heavily in research and development to stay ahead of the curve and capitalize on emerging trends. As we look to the future, we see huge potential for our AI solutions to transform industries and drive real-world impact at scale.","893":"We've seen great success with our interactive video campaigns, which allow customers to engage with our product in a whole new way. [SEP] I think 360 videos in another way are another example of this kind of interactive video experience, and my guess will be that we will see more different kinds of video media as time goes on. [SEP] As technology continues to evolve, we remain committed to staying at the forefront of these new and exciting opportunities for customer engagement.","894":"As we pivot towards the next phase of our growth strategy, we are laser-focused on enhancing the customer experience. This means investing heavily in technology, infrastructure, and talent. [SEP] because that's what is super important for us as we compete in this marketplace and more importantly double down on areas of differentiation we have. [SEP] We believe that by doing so, we can not only maintain our market position, but also capture significant market share from our competitors. Our unique value proposition, coupled with our relentless drive towards innovation, sets us apart in a crowded field.","895":"And as we continue to invest in our infrastructure, we wanted to get an update on how our depreciation expenses are shaping up. [SEP] In general it hasn\u2019t changed a ton in terms of that final component about fixed versus I think variable base, it's still been in the I think low [40%] [ph] as a range for us in terms of what depreciation versus what's more variable. [SEP] However, we are always monitoring and evaluating our expenses to ensure we are optimizing our costs and maximizing our profitability.","896":"As we analyze our results for the third quarter, it's important to note that we saw a divergence in demand between our consumer and commercial PC markets. [SEP] Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself. [SEP] We anticipate that this trend will continue into the next quarter, with commercial PCs driving the majority of our revenue.","897":"In response to a question about whether a certain event had an impact on the company's earnings. [SEP] So there are these events that are obviously big like the U.S. elections, the World Cup, Super Bowl, but there are enough of these all around the world that no one event is that big for our business. [SEP] That being said, we do take into account the potential impact of these events in our forecasting and planning processes,\" the speaker added. \"But overall, our business is not so heavily reliant on any one specific event.","898":"We have seen tremendous growth in our online sales channel over the past year. [SEP] And we expect we've got a lot of great opportunities to continue to innovate on that front. [SEP] In particular, we are exploring the use of augmented reality technology to enhance the online shopping experience for our customers.","899":"We are constantly assessing our business and looking for areas where we can improve profitability. We have identified two areas where we believe we can increase margin. [SEP] And so we would not \u2013 in fact, we will be very aggressive in taking margin in one place, which is different as we see a path to margin in a different spot. [SEP] Our analysis shows that by reducing inventory levels and implementing more efficient logistics practices, we can increase margin in one area. In the other area, we plan to raise prices on select products to capture more value in the market. Overall, we are confident that these strategies will help us achieve our profitability goals.","900":"We've been really focused on our marketing strategy lately. [SEP] So they were creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific actions like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer. [SEP] And we're happy to report that this campaign has seen a significant uptick in lead generation and conversion rates.","901":"We're now going to turn our attention to our cloud business. [SEP] And so when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw in Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on where we've been discussing, for a couple of quarters now, the investments we've made in our infrastructure, the investments we've made in our supply chain, the investments we've made in scaling the business. [SEP] This continued improvement in gross margin gives us confidence in our ability to continue investing in Azure and driving growth in the future.","902":"Thank you for that question, we have seen some concerns from investors regarding recent tariffs and trade tensions between countries. I would like to address those concerns now. [SEP] I do not view \u2013 just for avoidance of doubt here, I don't view that that issue has anything to do with the trade-related discussions between the countries. [SEP] Our company has been monitoring the trade discussions closely, and we are prepared to make any necessary adjustments to our business operations. However, I do not believe that the particular issue you mentioned is directly related to the ongoing trade negotiations between countries. We remain optimistic about the future of our industry and are committed to delivering strong results for our investors.","903":"Looking at the numbers, our revenue growth has exceeded our expectations. [SEP] I'm very excited about what we're seeing and very optimistic about the future. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to continue expanding our reach and improving our product offerings, and I believe that will pay off in the coming quarters.","904":"We've been listening to your concerns about how foreign exchange rates could impact our business, and we wanted to address that on this call. [SEP] I think my conclusion is that the guidance that we're providing for the first quarter that 39% to 40% it actually an incredible level of guidance given the foreign exchange headwinds that we're dealing with. [SEP] As a team, we've been working hard to find ways to mitigate these headwinds and maintain growth in 2021. We appreciate your continued support as we navigate these challenges.","905":"We are very excited about our new product line that we are preparing to launch in the coming quarters. [SEP] We think something like gaming, hundreds of millions of people are going to want to use it, and that's great. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to ensure that the gaming experience we provide is unmatched and offers unique features that avid gamers will love.","906":"We've received a few questions from investors regarding the impact of ad load on our business. [SEP] Just on Instagram versus Facebook and ad load, clearly the biggest driver of our business is core Facebook just in terms of sheer size and even sheer contribution to growth. [SEP] However, we've seen promising growth on Instagram as well, especially in certain markets. We're continuing to invest in both platforms and are optimistic about their potential for revenue growth in the coming years.","907":"Our Prime membership program has been a key driver of growth for our company. [SEP] So we plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video, to two-day shipping, to same-day shipping, to Prime Now. [SEP] We are also exploring new ways to streamline the delivery process and enhance the customer experience through Prime.","908":"As we look towards the future of our business, our team has been brainstorming ways to engage our audience with new and exciting content. [SEP] So in terms of experimenting with different content, I think we'll try a number of different things here. [SEP] Ultimately, our goal is to continue growing our platform and providing valuable content to our users, and we believe that trying out different approaches is key to achieving that.","909":"We implemented some changes in our supply chain operations last quarter. [SEP] So that helps them manage our inventory better and also respond to customer inquires. [SEP] Overall, we're seeing positive results from this new approach and we plan to continue refining it moving forward.","910":"During the quarter, we experienced notable growth in our digital advertising business. [SEP] Some of our clients approached us where they have a social budget or Facebook budget and some of that moves to Instagram and some people, it\u2019s incremental spend. [SEP] As a result, we are expanding our capabilities in social media advertising to better serve our clients' evolving needs.","911":"Looking at our sales projections for the next quarter, we're feeling optimistic about our ability to achieve our targets. We've seen strong demand for our products in both domestic and international markets, and we've been able to capitalize on emerging trends in the industry. [SEP] And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on \u2013 with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers and quite frankly, people. [SEP] Of course, there are always factors beyond our control that could impact our results. We're closely monitoring fluctuations in the currency markets and keeping a watchful eye on any potential supply chain disruptions. However, our team is committed to adapting quickly to any challenges that arise and remaining agile in our approach.","912":"Can you elaborate on where you see the most potential for growth in your advertising business? [SEP] I think if you think about where the growth remains, it really is in increasing the relevance of the ads, because the ads I think are getting better in terms of reaching the right people at the right time. [SEP] We are also investing in new technologies to improve targeting and personalization, which will further enhance the relevance of our ads.","913":"One of the key strategies for growth in the coming year is expanding our new product line into new markets. [SEP] We'll continue doing that in more places, but the U.S. was certainly one of the biggest places that we were focused on launching it. [SEP] With the success we have seen in the U.S., we are confident that we can replicate that success in other regions.","914":"Looking back on the past quarter, we are pleased with the progress we made towards our goals. [SEP] Again, we feel we're very encouraged by the customer response to our offerings in Q4. [SEP] As we move forward into the next quarter, we plan to continue focusing on meeting the evolving demands of our customers.","915":"We've now finished another extremely strong quarter, from both a strategic perspective as well as an operational perspective. [SEP] But I would reiterate the biggest driver of the transactional performance this quarter was really the value prop people saw. [SEP] Our marketing team really did an amazing job of highlighting the benefits and value proposition of our products and services.","916":"Our Windows platform is evolving rapidly to meet the demands of our customers in an ever-changing technological landscape. We are focused on delivering a seamless experience across all devices, whether it be a PC, tablet or mobile phone. [SEP] So overall, we will build a differentiated Windows because our application experiences for our cloud end points will be native in windows and at the same time, we will make sure that our services are available on all end points driving more usage, more subscription growth.

We believe this will drive greater loyalty and help us to expand our user base in new and exciting ways. Thank you for joining us on this call.","917":"During the first quarter of the year, we made a significant change in our accounting policies. [SEP] It was - for Q1, the impact of a change was a decrease of about $130 million to cost of sales due to the capitalization change. [SEP] However, despite this change, our profit margins remained stable and we were able to achieve our revenue targets for the quarter.","918":"We received a lot of questions about our inventory levels during the last quarter. [SEP] You know that in general, we decrease our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. [SEP] This year, we noticed a larger decrease in inventory than we had planned for due to stronger-than-expected sales.","919":"Our mobile app has been a key driver of our revenue growth in the past quarter. [SEP] And part of it is that there's of course a bigger opportunity when people have their phones with them all the time, but I think that there are plenty of other worlds that we could be living in where we wouldn't have necessarily executed on that opportunity. [SEP] Our team has worked tirelessly to optimize the user experience on our mobile app, and I believe this has contributed significantly to our success.","920":"Our team is thrilled to report another quarter of strong growth and success. [SEP] So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. [SEP] We attribute this growth not only to the quality of our content, but also to our efforts in expanding our global reach and improving our user experience.","921":"In terms of our share repurchase strategy, we have been evaluating it carefully over the past few months. [SEP] We look at it on two fronts: just offsetting the dilution from the share issuances that we have and then secondarily, to be opportunistic. [SEP] Our goal is always to maximize shareholder value, so we will continue to monitor market conditions and pursue opportunities that make sense for us.","922":"We are excited to share that our targeting tools have been performing exceptionally well. We have seen an increase in conversion rates and customer satisfaction. Now, let's talk about how to utilize these tools effectively. [SEP] If you use our targeting tools well, you can actually start out with demand fulfillment. [SEP] By utilizing our targeting tools, you can create a more personalized experience for customers. This can lead to repeat business and positive word-of-mouth advertising. We highly recommend incorporating these tools into your marketing strategy. Thank you for joining our call today.","923":"We've been investing heavily in our targeting capabilities over the past year. [SEP] So with targeting, a more relevant ad is just better, it's better experience for consumers because they see something they like in their News Feed and it has a higher return for marketers. [SEP] And based on our recent data, we've seen a significant increase in click-through rates and overall engagement with our targeted ads.","924":"We have experienced slow sales in the last quarter due to reasons beyond our control. [SEP] That\u2019s not unusual prior to a launch cycle and that will clearly impact our revenue in the quarter. [SEP] However, we are confident that the launch cycle will lead to a significant increase in revenue for the next quarter.","925":"Now let's take a closer look at our Q4 financial results. [SEP] We did see headcount growth come down modestly in Q4 from Q3 to 42%. [SEP] However, overall headcount growth for the year was still strong at 50%.","926":"Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, which is up 102% year-over-year. I want to take a moment to break down a portion of that revenue that has been a topic of discussion - the $560 million in new revenue. [SEP] As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised \u2013 or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%. [SEP] While this new revenue is significant, it's important to note that it came from a variety of sources, including new partnerships and acquisitions. Overall, we are pleased with the growth we've seen in our core business and the potential for continued expansion in the coming quarters. Thank you for your time today, and we look forward to updating you again soon.","927":"We've been exploring different ways to engage with our customers and provide them with the best user experience possible. One area that we've been particularly focused on is messaging services. [SEP] It feels \u2013 when you're using a messaging service, that everything there is very intimate and private so it feels like a more natural space to be interacting with a business in a private way for doing transactions. [SEP] We've seen a great response from our customers who appreciate the convenience and privacy of messaging-based transactions. As a result, we'll be working to further integrate this feature into our overall customer engagement strategy.","928":"We've been investing in our hybrid capabilities for some time now. [SEP] So we don't think of hybrid as some stopgap as a move to the cloud. [SEP] Instead, we see it as a strategic approach that enables our customers to take advantage of both on-premises and cloud-based solutions, maximizing their flexibility and minimizing risk.","929":"Now let's turn our attention to our services business and how it's impacting our revenue. [SEP] And then we are showing that on that portion of installed base driven services business, there is a part that is related to -- where we recognize revenue in terms of the full transaction value. [SEP] However, there are also parts of this business where we recognize revenue over time, based on the delivery of specific services.","930":"We're committed to constantly improving our offerings and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers. One area where we're seeing a lot of interest is in hybrid data centers and cloud adoption. [SEP] The lower prices and services that we offer, and as I said, we'll work on things that will make it easier and easier for customers to work with us with their hybrid data centers or transfer their volume to us. [SEP] We believe that by offering competitive pricing and a seamless customer experience, we can continue to grow our market share in this area. And as always, we welcome feedback from our customers to help us refine and improve our offerings.","931":"Now let's talk about our fulfillment capacity. It's been a big focus for us this year and we're excited to share some progress on that front. [SEP] In the quarter, in Q3 we added 18 fulfillment centers and we've added five more in October. [SEP] With these new centers, we are able to offer faster delivery times to our customers and improve our overall efficiency. We also have plans to continue expanding our fulfillment network in the coming months to keep up with growing demand.","932":"During the past quarter, we continued to invest in new features and technologies to enhance the user experience on our platform. We also launched several strategic initiatives aimed at diversifying our revenue streams and improving our overall financial performance. [SEP] But we started building things like Marketplace, that is a tab that and even if the majority of people on Facebook don't use it, it's still hundreds of millions of people are using it. [SEP] This is just one example of how we are constantly innovating and finding new ways to engage with our users. At the same time, we are also exploring opportunities to partner with other companies and expand our reach into different markets. Overall, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders while maintaining our core values of transparency, authenticity, and user privacy.","933":"We've seen some fluctuation in our feed pricing over the past year, which I know has been an area of concern for investors. [SEP] But I think in terms of it converging on feed from any pricing perspective, that's a journey that's going to take years, not quarters. [SEP] However, we are committed to making progress and taking steps to bring our feed pricing in line with the market. We have a dedicated team working on this initiative and will continue to update our stakeholders on our progress.","934":"Now let's move on to our earnings report for this quarter. [SEP] First, on EGM, I'll just say the growth is across a lot of different products, none to exactly call out here, and we think that a lot of it is, of course, driven by the growth of Prime itself. [SEP] Our team is actively working on new strategies to continue this growth in the coming months.","935":"The first question comes from the line of John Smith from JP Morgan. [SEP] But, more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it is, we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever, we've got new products on the way, the pipeline is full of great new stuff both on the product and the services side. [SEP] And of course, our strong partnerships with key players in the industry only improve our ability to reach new customers and expand our market share.","936":"Moving onto our financial results, I'd like to discuss the impact of foreign exchange on our earnings. [SEP] The foreign exchange headwinds as I was explaining to Shannon, they will be on a sequential basis a headwind of more than 100 basis points. [SEP] However, we believe that our strong performance in other areas of our business will help offset these headwinds and we remain confident in our ability to meet our financial targets for the year. Does anyone have any questions on this topic?","937":"Our global expansion strategy has been successful and we are excited to continue to explore new markets. As we expand into new territories, we are finding exciting opportunities for growth. [SEP] As I go through different countries as I've been traveling lately, and looking at some things in the market, other things that are coming, the very cool thing is they're all over the place. [SEP] I am particularly impressed with the trends we are seeing in Asia. There is a strong demand for our products and services and we are committed to meeting that demand. Overall, I am optimistic about our future growth prospects.","938":"Our Azure platform has continued to see significant growth in usage over the past quarter, with an increased number of enterprise customers choosing to leverage our services and capabilities. [SEP] So while we remain focused on efficiency and the utilization of the hardware and software is also important to continue to see premium upsell, premium workload usage, so the customers are getting the most out of their deployments and usage of the Azure platform. [SEP] We believe that by continuing to enhance the value proposition and driving increased adoption of premium workloads and usage, we can not only drive revenue growth, but also deepen our relationships with customers and capture additional market share.","939":"We continue to see growth across all segments of our business and are pleased with the progress we have made. [SEP] The Azure benefits are things both for Windows Server as well as for SQL which I think are very, very unique to us and you see that. [SEP] As a result, we are confident in our ability to maintain our leadership position in the cloud computing market and deliver value to our customers.","940":"Our third quarter results have shown a significant growth in our online sales, thanks to our loyal customers who continue to trust and support us. [SEP] The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program. [SEP] Furthermore, with the ongoing pandemic and the shift towards e-commerce, we believe that the Prime program will continue to be a key driver of growth for Amazon.","941":"Thank you for joining us today for our Q3 earnings conference call. [SEP] As you can tell from the numbers, we've significantly improved since the beginning of the year. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to implement strategic changes and we are pleased to see the positive impact on our financial results.","942":"We've seen a lot of growth in our social media marketing efforts over the past quarter. [SEP] Now, there are some who spend a large portion of their budget on Facebook, but that's actually very unusual. [SEP] Most businesses tend to allocate their advertising dollars across a variety of platforms, including Google and Instagram as well.","943":"We had a challenging quarter due to increased competition in the market and changes in consumer behavior. [SEP] In the medium to long-run however, we believe that we\u2019re really well-positioned to take share from other platforms out there. [SEP] Our focus for the near-term is on improving our user engagement and expanding our offerings to drive growth.","944":"We've been focusing on our core product and making sure that we're delivering value to our customers. How are we doing on that front?\"\n\n\"We've received a lot of positive feedback from our users about the improvements we've made to our core product. [SEP] But in terms of our investments in that core product value, it is actually happening on all those three. [SEP] We're also exploring new opportunities to expand our product offerings and provide even more value to our customers.\"\n\n\"Our commitment to investing in our core product is just one aspect of our broader strategy to drive growth and deliver strong results.\"\n\n\"We're confident that our focus on delivering value to our customers will continue to pay off in the long run.","945":"Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, who will give a more detailed breakdown of our financial performance this quarter.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we plan to continue investing in research and development to stay at the forefront of our industry and drive growth for years to come.","946":"During the last quarter, we have seen a significant increase in our social media engagement. [SEP] In terms of learnings, one of the most important learnings we have is that video formats are different on Facebook [SEP] As a result, we plan to allocate more resources towards creating video content for Facebook in the upcoming quarters.","947":"In terms of geographic performance, let's talk about Europe. [SEP] Overall, we did see Europe had a reacceleration of growth in Q2 versus Q1. [SEP] This was primarily driven by a rebound in Germany, our largest market in the region. However, we are still cautious about the potential impact of Brexit on our operations in the UK. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and adjust our strategy accordingly.","948":"Our sales team has been working tirelessly to implement strategies that will drive revenue growth for the company. [SEP] And now couple that with the call we've made to provide an upgrade offer. [SEP] We are confident that this offer will incentivize our current customers to upgrade their services, resulting in increased revenue and a stronger financial performance for the company.","949":"Thank you for joining us on our earnings conference call today. [SEP] So impacts in Japan more directly come to the P&L as opposed to on our under C&B balances and that's why this quarter, you saw some weakness in commercial licensing, but when adjusted for FX, our unearned balance and bookings actually felt quite good from our commercial perspective. [SEP] As we look ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about our commercial licensing business in Japan and are closely monitoring the situation with the ongoing pandemic.","950":"During the third quarter, we focused on expanding our customer base through targeted marketing efforts. [SEP] I happened to meet this woman, Angel [Moore], who's running their marketing this year. [SEP] Angel has been instrumental in driving our sales growth through her innovative campaigns and strategic partnerships.","951":"Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the commentary you provided around your recent acquisition and how it integrates with your overall strategy. [SEP] And I think in many ways Keith what we have done is a really a natural extension of some of the investments we\u2019ve made over the past 18 months to add technical resources to be more present in customer accounts, to really drive their transformation towards success outcomes. [SEP] Can you provide some more color on how these investments have impacted your ability to drive revenue growth and expand your customer base?","952":"Our company has multiple revenue streams that have contributed to our strong quarterly earnings report. [SEP] It has Office 365, it has EMS, and it has its Windows 10 commercial component. [SEP] We are particularly pleased with the success of our cloud services, which include Office 365, EMS, and our Windows 10 commercial component. These products have seen strong adoption rates among enterprise customers and we expect continued growth in this area.","953":"We've seen a decline in sales for this particular product line over the past few quarters. [SEP] So over the long-term, that is a situation that we will need to try to figure out a way forward on. [SEP] In the short-term, we plan to ramp up marketing efforts to try to boost sales.","954":"We apologize for any confusion or frustration this may cause. However, we must adhere to certain regulations and guidelines that restrict us from sharing certain information publicly. [SEP] And it won't be very transparent to you, and that's how it is. [SEP] Rest assured, our team is working diligently to ensure that we remain compliant with all regulations while still providing our investors with the most accurate information possible.","955":"We're really excited about this new business opportunity that we've been exploring. [SEP] It has some additional capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our standpoint. [SEP] We expect this investment to contribute significantly to our overall growth strategy in the coming years.","956":"When asked about our company's key priorities for this year, I'm happy to say that we've been focusing heavily on improving our platform for independent software vendors (ISVs). [SEP] We now, in fact, one of the big areas of investment this year was the core sell capacity in our field so that ISVs can be successful on our platform. [SEP] And I'm proud to announce that these investments have already started to pay off, as we're already seeing an increase in sales and usage of applications built by ISVs on our platform.","957":"Our sales have grown rapidly over the past quarter and we are seeing strong demand for our products. [SEP] We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes. [SEP] In addition to fulfillment space, we are also exploring new technologies and processes to improve our supply chain efficiency and reduce shipping times.","958":"Our marketing team has been working tirelessly to optimize our ad strategy and improve engagement rates. We understand the importance of creating content that resonates with our target audience. [SEP] How do we find those ads that are going to be more engaging, they're going to get more clicks, that they're going to get more views, that are going to get more installs. [SEP] We have also been utilizing data analytics to track the performance of our ads and make necessary adjustments. Additionally, we plan to conduct more market research to gain insight into what our customers are looking for in terms of ad content. Ultimately, our goal is to maximize ROI and ensure the highest level of user engagement.","959":"Can you provide some details on the breakdown of tablet usage by activity? [SEP] The usage is defined as measured in web browsing is like 71% of total tablets, as I think Luca covered earlier. [SEP] And looking ahead, are there any initiatives in the works to increase usage in other areas, such as video streaming or productivity apps?","960":"Our data shows that customers who use our devices to access Amazon content are more likely to make repeat purchases and become Prime members. [SEP] We think as engagement \u2013 as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. [SEP] We will continue to invest in developing new devices and features to enhance the customer experience and drive even greater engagement with Amazon.","961":"Now let's turn our attention to our digital marketing initiatives. As I mentioned last quarter, we've been ramping up our efforts on social media, particularly on Facebook and Instagram. [SEP] We're seeing good progress on both of them, and interestingly, insurance companies have been pretty active both on Facebook and Instagram, so we're optimistic about that. [SEP] Our social media team has been working closely with our product development team to create engaging content and targeted ads. We've also been exploring influencer partnerships to expand our reach. Overall, we believe that our social media strategy will continue to drive growth for the company.","962":"We're seeing a huge demand for cloud services across all sectors, and gaming is no exception. [SEP] And one other point I think I made in my remarks earlier is gaming also is a growth area for Azure. [SEP] We've recently partnered with several major gaming companies to provide them with the scalable, high-performance cloud infrastructure they need to deliver their games to players around the world.","963":"We've been working hard to expand our offerings and develop new technologies to better serve our customers. As a result, we've seen strong growth in recent quarters and we're confident we can continue that momentum moving forward. [SEP] And we like having more abilities, more products, more apps to work with so that we can drive those business results. [SEP] Of course, we recognize that simply having more tools at our disposal isn't enough. We need to use those tools effectively and make smart, data-driven decisions to drive growth and profitability. That's why we're continually investing in our workforce and providing them with the training and resources they need to succeed.","964":"We have seen a significant increase in video content consumption on our platform over the past year. [SEP] as people spend more time with video, and more time is going to video, that is going to have a limiting factor to how much time they spend in News Feed. [SEP] However, we believe that this shift towards video will present opportunities for us to increase engagement and ad revenue in our video ad products.","965":"We've seen great success with Windows 10 adoption and usage, with over 1.3 billion devices now running the operating system. [SEP] So overall I think the most strategic objective for us is to get developer momentum with Windows 10 and that's where we're focusing on with a lot of different actions. [SEP] Our goal is to make Windows 10 the most attractive and accessible platform for developers, offering a seamless and innovative experience for users.","966":"Can you give us an update on the progress of your e-commerce initiatives? [SEP] We are testing a buy button in the new shop section on pages, but again, that buy button is letting people buy directly from their advertisers, not from us. [SEP] We believe this feature has the potential to increase conversions for our advertisers and improve the overall user experience on our platform.","967":"Our expansion plans for the upcoming quarter include entering new markets in Europe and Asia. [SEP] We think when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. [SEP] We have already seen this trend in our recent launch in South America where our existing customers increased their usage of AWS services by 25%.","968":"One of our key strategies this quarter was to experiment with different advertising formats on our platform. [SEP] While the 30-second ad does perform well in News Feed, we also see people understanding that some of the formats are different. [SEP] As a result, we have seen an increase in engagement with our longer form video ads and sponsored posts.","969":"One of the key areas of focus for our company has been sustainability. We recognize the importance of being environmentally conscious and socially responsible. [SEP] They've cared deeply about it since the first conversations I've had with Kevin. [SEP] Our commitment to sustainability has only grown stronger over the years. I'm proud to say that we've made significant progress in reducing our carbon footprint and supporting ethical business practices. We will continue to prioritize sustainability as we move forward and seek new ways to make a positive impact on the world.","970":"Our company has been impacted by macroeconomic trends in the markets we operate in. [SEP] When you think about all the -- particularly all the commodity-driven economies, Brazil and Russia and emerging markets, but also Canada, Australia in developed markets, clearly the economy is significantly weaker than a year ago. [SEP] Despite challenging conditions, we have implemented cost-cutting measures to mitigate the effects of weaker economies on our business.","971":"We've been closely monitoring the changes in the market and we've identified some important trends. [SEP] So I think you're going to see it impacting across the spectrum of our lines [SEP] But we're confident in our ability to adapt quickly and continue delivering value to our shareholders.","972":"We have seen steady growth in our business over the past few quarters. [SEP] I'm always a little vary to put too much into the unit growth number. [SEP] However, we must also consider other factors such as market saturation and potential competition.","973":"Moving on to our other businesses, I want to touch on Apple Music. [SEP] We have other businesses like the Apple Music streaming service, which is growing very fast because we just started it a couple of years ago, so we are getting a lot of new subscribers there. [SEP] We are also seeing an uptick in revenue from our App Store, with a significant increase in in-app purchases and subscriptions.","974":"We have seen a significant increase in the use of IoT devices in our industry. [SEP] Lot of the sensors today are in fact rendezvousing some of that data straight to the cloud. [SEP] As a result, we have been investing heavily in our cloud infrastructure to accommodate this data influx.","975":"Now let's talk about our revenue and income trends over the past year. [SEP] So what you've seen is a push of revenue and income from Q4 into Q1, 2 and 3 that we've mentioned on each call. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate a strong finish to the year and a continuation of this trend. We remain confident in our ability to meet or exceed our annual revenue and income targets. Thank you for your continued support and interest in our company.","976":"We are pleased to announce the continued success of our program and its expansion. [SEP] That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. [SEP] This expansion will allow us to reach even more customers and further increase our market share.","977":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith with ABC Bank. [SEP] The OEM Pro number as I talked about was impacted by a number of factors, but what we\u2019ve seen is over the past three or four quarters, a pretty consistent sort of high single-digit performance once you take out various impacts and chip supply and inventory levels on the tariffs. [SEP] Can you give us some more insight into the specific factors that impacted the OEM Pro number? And looking ahead, do you anticipate any similar challenges in the coming quarters?","978":"As we review our business performance from the last quarter, I want to emphasize the importance of our client retention and renewal rate. Our team has been working diligently to strengthen our relationships with existing clients and expand our offerings to meet their evolving needs. [SEP] And I would say, I start with renewals, not just that we renew the contract but how many new products, new services did we add to that contract? [SEP] Additionally, we prioritize cross-selling and upselling opportunities with our current clients to drive additional revenue streams. We've seen a significant increase in revenue from these efforts and plan to continue this focus going forward. Overall, our renewal rate and contract expansion metrics are promising indicators of a strong foundation for future growth.","979":"In response to feedback from our customers, we've been reevaluating our approach to measuring engagement on our platform. [SEP] So now we're going to shift that that methodology a little bit to instead of just being focused on the content, now to be more focused on trying to measure and have people tell us what is creating the most meaningful interaction in their lives. [SEP] We believe that this shift will allow us to better understand and meet the needs of our users, ultimately driving increased usage and revenue growth for the company.","980":"We saw incredible success on our annual Prime Day event last month. [SEP] It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike. [SEP] Our technology and operational capabilities continue to improve, allowing us to better serve customers and meet demand during these peak events. We are already looking forward to next year's Prime Day.","981":"Now let's move on to our plans for improving user engagement on our platform. [SEP] And for video search \u2013 search is a big priority and a thing that we're working on across all of the different verticals, not just video but also all the posts on Facebook, all of the content that people are selling in Marketplace, the groups that people are joining and sharing and all the news content. [SEP] We believe that optimizing search functionality can greatly enhance the user experience and make Facebook a more valuable tool for our advertisers.","982":"Moving on to our regional performance, let's start with international markets. [SEP] And then rest-of-world, we saw a rebound in Latin America, especially Brazil, so we're seeing some particular strength there. [SEP] Despite some challenges in Asia, overall we're pleased with the growth we're seeing outside of our domestic market.","983":"Our strategy for the first half of the year has been to focus on improving our backend systems and optimizing our supply chain. [SEP] We're obviously expecting faster growth in the back half \u2013 back three quarters of the year, so that's \u2013 video's going to be a component in driving that. [SEP] Additionally, we are investing in new product development and marketing initiatives that we expect will further drive revenue growth in the coming quarters.","984":"Thank you for joining us today. I'll begin by providing some updates on our recent performance. Overall, we're very pleased with how the holiday season went and the momentum we're seeing across our business. [SEP] As part of the holiday offering, we sold a number of record breaking number of Alexa devices as well and I think just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members, we had the most ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. [SEP] Additionally, we saw strong growth in our advertising business, with revenues increasing by 30%. This was driven by increased demand for sponsored products and higher click-through rates. Looking ahead, we remain focused on investing in our core offerings, expanding our global footprint, and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. Thank you again for joining us today.","985":"Our Q3 earnings report shows a strong increase in revenue from our advertising business. [SEP] So rather than go to every advertiser both through our sales force and through our online tools where we sell and say we have a new format, you need to create the new format, you need to figure out the placement being able to just take what they are already doing like Feed ads, converted into Stories and place at anywhere helps us move people into these formats. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and improve our advertising offerings, we expect to see continued growth in this area.","986":"Can you expand on the capabilities of your database solution? [SEP] It's a database that's on-premise that can be tiered with the cloud. [SEP] How does this offering stack up against competitors in the market?\" \n\n\"It's a unique offering that allows our customers to have the flexibility of both on-premise and cloud-based data storage. We understand that some organizations may have concerns about moving all of their data to the cloud, and this solution provides a seamless transition for them. Additionally, it offers the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the cloud when needed. We believe this sets us apart from other database solutions on the market and gives us a competitive advantage.","987":"We've seen a lot of growth in our international markets lately. Can you speak to your outlook for these regions? [SEP] I think it will take longer for the GDP to rival it, but that's not critical for us to have a great success there. [SEP] Our focus moving forward will be on maximizing our reach in these markets and continuing to deliver exceptional value to our customers.","988":"As we look ahead to the first quarter of this year, we do expect to face some challenges. [SEP] It's -- given the 30% plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's 1 major headwind from Q4 to Q1. [SEP] However, we are confident that our team is well equipped to manage these obstacles and continue delivering results for our shareholders.","989":"We are pleased to announce the financial results for the third quarter of this fiscal year. [SEP] The enterprise business is clearly picking up and more and more companies are either contracting for or writing apps themselves. [SEP] As a result, the enterprise division has seen a significant increase in revenue compared to the same period last year.","990":"As we continue to expand our services and grow our customer base, we are focused on ensuring that our infrastructure can support our increasing demand. [SEP] We've got a lot of infrastructure investment that we're making across data centers, servers, network. [SEP] This investment will not only enhance the performance and reliability of our services but also provide future opportunities for innovation and growth.","991":"Regarding our staffing plans for our fulfillment centers, I wanted to share an update with everyone on the call. We have some aggressive goals for this year in terms of expanding our workforce. [SEP] I think we put out a release, I think, earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. [SEP] We've already made significant progress towards our goal, with over 30,000 operations employees brought on board in the first half of the year. We're on track to meet our target of 120,000 new hires by the end of 2021, which will enable us to continue scaling up our operations and improving our delivery times for customers.","992":"We are committed to enhancing our market position and growing revenue through strategic initiatives. [SEP] We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. [SEP] Our focus on building our intra-network capabilities will enable us to deliver better service and value to our customers.","993":"Our next question comes from the line of John from Morgan Stanley. [SEP] I think we've made some strong changes on Facebook in terms of meaningful social interactions, and I think the history of our ability to develop and iterate on consumer products shows that we can help people as they evolve, share the things they want to share, and have a very meaningful and important experience in feed as they're sharing. [SEP] And with the ongoing improvements we're making, I am confident that we will continue to build on this momentum and provide even more meaningful experiences for our users.","994":"We're very excited about the future of virtual reality, and we believe it has the potential to change the way people consume entertainment. It's still early days for VR, but we're investing heavily in the technology to ensure that we can offer our customers the best possible experience. [SEP] There are around, I think, more than 200 million, almost 250 million people who have either an Xbox, a PlayStation or a Wii, and we think that that audience is going to the type of people who are going to be very excited about the type of experiences initially that you can have with virtual reality. [SEP] Of course, there are challenges that come with developing VR content, and we're working hard to overcome those. For example, we need to create experiences that are immersive and engaging, but also easy to navigate and not too overwhelming for users. We're confident that we can overcome these challenges, and we're excited to see what the future holds for VR and our business.","995":"During the last quarter, we saw a strong growth in our revenue. [SEP] We will of course continue to do that where it makes sense and where opportunity presents itself. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new markets and evaluating potential acquisitions to expand our business.","996":"Our team has been working diligently to capitalize on the growing e-commerce industry and to continue expanding our reach. We are committed to providing the best possible experience for our customers and our shareholders. [SEP] So I think you should think about it that way that certainly think its big opportunity and again, one of the reasons I want to give you an update, last quarter on Prime growth and you can see that that\u2019s going very well. [SEP] Additionally, we are excited to announce our plans for further international expansion, which we believe will contribute to our continued growth. We are confident that our investments in technology and infrastructure will continue to strengthen our position in the market and drive future success.","997":"One of the questions we get a lot is how we think about balancing investment opportunities versus our ongoing operations. [SEP] And so, again, we're juggling the investment in the places where we feel like we have long-term opportunities where we need to invest with making sure we're getting continuously better in all our other processes at the same time. [SEP] It's a delicate balance, but we feel like we've made good progress in both areas over the past few quarters.","998":"Our platform is really unique in the sense that we offer a wide variety of tools and functionalities. [SEP] We also make a lot of things that they couldn't do in other platforms available on us. [SEP] This has given us a significant competitive advantage, and we have seen a lot of interest from customers who value this flexibility and customization.","999":"I'd like to take a moment to discuss our strategy for supporting small and medium-sized businesses.\"\n\n\"Another area we've identified for growth is the SMB market. [SEP] We're also very focused on helping SMBs have a presence, especially a mobile presence. [SEP] To that end, we've invested significantly in our mobile app development resources.\"\n\n\"We believe that by offering affordable and user-friendly mobile solutions, we can empower these businesses to compete effectively in the digital landscape.","1000":"Now let's turn our attention to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] As you know, foreign exchange has been a very significant headwind over the last three-plus years, but we've been able to manage that. [SEP] We are continuing to monitor the currency fluctuations closely and have implemented strategies to minimize its impact on our business moving forward.","1001":"Our team has been focused on improving the user experience for our customers. [SEP] But it was hard to do in the previous generation because of the server infrastructure and what I would say sophistication of IT required. [SEP] However, with advancements in cloud computing and automation, we have been able to streamline our processes and scale much more efficiently.","1002":"We have received a lot of questions about our performance metrics for our different business units. [SEP] So I don't really think it\u2019s about a percentage, but it\u2019s about each of them continuing to make progress. [SEP] Our focus is on achieving sustainable growth and improvement, and we believe that each unit has its own unique challenges and opportunities that require individualized attention.","1003":"Our strategy is to expand our platform's content offerings to compete with our rivals. [SEP] We're looking at a wide range of content, and we're really working towards a revenue share model with creators. [SEP] We believe this revenue share model will incentivize creators to produce high-quality content and foster a mutually beneficial relationship.","1004":"We are pleased to report a strong quarter, with revenue growth exceeding our expectations. Our team has worked hard to execute on our strategic initiatives, and the results speak for themselves. However, as we look to the future, there are certain challenges that we must address. [SEP] But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. [SEP] As we continue to expand our operations, we need to ensure that our leaders have the capacity to support these efforts. That means recruiting and retaining talented individuals who can help us achieve our goals. We also need to make sure that our existing staff isn't overburdened, as this can lead to burnout and turnover. Ultimately, our success will depend on both our financial performance and our ability to manage our resources effectively.","1005":"We have been exploring ways to increase our customer base and drive sales. One of the strategies we implemented this quarter was partnering with Amazon. [SEP] The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. [SEP] These initiatives have proven to be successful as we have seen an increase in online sales and customer satisfaction. We will continue to evaluate new opportunities for growth and expansion in the coming quarters.","1006":"During the past quarter, we continued to expand our presence in China, which remains a key market for our business. Our strategy of targeting the country's burgeoning middle class and rapidly growing digital landscape has enabled us to achieve strong revenue growth in the region. [SEP] And, launching the Hong Kong region gets us to a footprint of 19 cities in China. [SEP] Looking ahead, we plan to further expand our operations in China, as we believe there is still significant untapped potential in this market. In addition to launching in Hong Kong, we are exploring opportunities to enter new cities and introduce new products and services that will appeal to Chinese consumers. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to drive continued growth and success in this important region.","1007":"Our new pricing strategy has allowed us to unbundle our products and services so that customers have more flexibility in purchasing what they need. We believe that this will lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. [SEP] If you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases even a 7, you may have paid $199 for \u2013 and now in an unbundled world it's obviously much more than that. [SEP] However, we understand that this may not be as affordable for some of our long-time customers who have been with us for several years. We are looking at ways to offer discounts or incentives to those who upgrade to our latest products, and we appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate this new pricing landscape together.","1008":"Our focus on delivering gaming experiences has resulted in strong growth for our gaming division. [SEP] And we now have a business model with Game Pass as well as all the supporting mechanisms for Game Pass like game streaming, we\u2019ve a social network in Xbox Live that is the best in the business. [SEP] This has also allowed us to attract and retain a large and loyal user base, as well as attract new gamers to our ecosystem.","1009":"We've been closely monitoring the changes in data privacy regulations, and have made some updates to our product offerings to adhere to these new guidelines. [SEP] I think what we think is that depending on how people react to the controls and the ad settings, there could be some limitations to data usage. [SEP] That being said, we're still committed to providing advertisers with valuable insights into their target audiences. We'll continue to explore new ways to collect and analyze data that both prioritize consumer privacy and meet our clients' needs.","1010":"We've been closely analyzing our customer acquisition strategy and identifying areas where we can improve. [SEP] In certain geographies, the way that we win is to get switchers. [SEP] We're seeing significant success in these areas and are confident that we can continue to grow our customer base through this approach.","1011":"The company was recently criticized for not addressing social issues in their products. [SEP] A few years ago, we probably would\u2019ve rolled this out and tried to deal with issues as they came up with, but now part of our new approach of trying to be more proactive about social issues is trying to build in from the ground up, getting this right upfront. [SEP] This new approach has led to better feedback from customers and a more positive reputation for the company.","1012":"Our focus on innovation and growth has led us to explore new partnerships and opportunities. [SEP] And so we've made a number of product and performance investments there with Facebook like being a good example of that. [SEP] As a result, we have seen significant improvements in user engagement and revenue growth.","1013":"Thank you for your question. Our ad revenue growth in the last quarter was quite strong, driven by a number of factors. [SEP] but I would just say that this is primarily driven by News Feed pricing, and then you have right-hand-column pricing as well, so you have impressions on Facebook News Feed, Instagram feed, as well as Facebook right-hand column. [SEP] Overall, we're continuing to see strong demand for our ad offerings, and we're optimistic about our ability to continue growing our revenue going forward. Of course, there are always potential challenges and risks to be aware of, but we believe we're well-positioned to navigate them successfully.","1014":"Our focus this quarter has been on improving the resilience and reliability of our server management software. [SEP] We also have built now into windows server backup and disaster recovery, same thing with SQL server. [SEP] We've received positive feedback from customers who have already utilized these features in their backup and disaster recovery protocols.","1015":"During the quarter, our detection systems flagged a record number of suspicious activities, helping us to prevent potential fraud and protect our customers. We continue to invest heavily in new technologies and algorithms that improve our ability to identify fraudulent behavior. [SEP] There are going to be things that our systems miss, no matter how well-tuned we are. [SEP] However, we are aware that fraudsters are constantly evolving their tactics, and we must remain vigilant to stay ahead of them. We encourage our customers to also take steps to protect themselves, such as using strong, unique passwords and regularly monitoring their accounts for any unusual activity.","1016":"I'd like to address some concerns about safety and how we're working to make our platform a safer space for all users. [SEP] So on safety, I think given the volume of content that people share, if you want to have any hope of doing it in real time, the only hope is building AI systems that can either identify things and handle them proactively or at the very least, flag them for a lot of people who work for us who can then look at them rather than waiting for people in our community to flag those after they've already seen them. [SEP] We've invested heavily in developing and training our AI systems to better detect and prevent harmful content from being shared on our platform.","1017":"So with that said, we have made progress in terms of streamlining our operations and increasing efficiency. However, there's still more work to be done in certain areas. [SEP] But at this point, we're still working on that and kind of getting it up to speed. [SEP] We anticipate that once we have everything running smoothly, we'll start to see significant cost savings and improved overall performance. In the meantime, we appreciate our team's hard work and patience as we continue to fine-tune our processes.","1018":"We have been seeing a significant uptick in cyber attacks across various industries in recent months. As these attacks become more sophisticated, businesses are realizing the importance of investing in newer and better security technologies. [SEP] When that happens, it does create demand for new devices and modern devices that improved security. [SEP] In response to this demand, we have dedicated a portion of our R&D team to developing cutting-edge security features for our devices. We are confident that our latest product line will provide our customers with the highest level of security available in the market today.","1019":"We have recently been experiencing some challenges with our digital advertising revenue. [SEP] I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. [SEP] However, we are confident that our upcoming fall lineup will attract a significant viewership and generate strong ad revenue.","1020":"One area of our business that we have invested heavily in over the past year is artificial intelligence. [SEP] But what we've actually also found is that through some of our AI research, we can look at the responses that businesses give to common questions and can confidently provide the right reply a lot of the time. [SEP] We believe that continuing to develop and leverage our AI capabilities will be a key driver of growth and success in the years to come.","1021":"We're now going to move on to our expense guidance for the upcoming year. [SEP] So that compensation expense base that we're bringing into 2019 is really factoring into the overall growth guidance for the total expense guide, so that's a big factor there. [SEP] However, we're confident in our ability to manage these expenses and maintain our strong financial position moving forward.","1022":"During the past quarter, we continued to invest in our cloud and IoT businesses, which drove strong revenue growth. We also saw solid demand for our Surface devices, and we continue to make inroads into the education market with our affordable Windows devices. [SEP] And if you think about when we say Windows-as-a-service it\u2019s actually a pretty profound construct which involves us being able to not only think about what ships with OEMs, but how do we on a continuous basis, if it\u2019s a consumer we have things now in the store, we have subscriptions, we have gaming and then when it comes to the enterprise there\u2019s management, security, servicing which is all unique value. [SEP] As part of our commitment to Windows-as-a-service, we're constantly exploring new ways to provide value to our customers. For example, we recently introduced new features for Windows 10 that improve productivity and make it easier for businesses to manage their devices. Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions that meet our customers' needs and drive long-term growth for the company.","1023":"We've been monitoring our new product launch closely and have some early data to share with you all. [SEP] The early trends are good, but I think this is really going to be an area that is proportional to the amount of quality content that is in the system, and the business model is really going to be the thing that enables that. [SEP] We're confident that with our strong content strategy and business model, we'll continue to see positive growth in this area.","1024":"We are really pleased with our performance this quarter and are excited about the momentum we are seeing across the business. [SEP] I would just say that, our growth is coming from customers that span from start-ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us, and many of them have gone \u2013 a large number have gone all-in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result. [SEP] We remain focused on providing our customers with the most innovative and reliable cloud services in the market, and we will continue to invest in our platform to drive even more growth in the future.","1025":"Our new marketing strategy has really paid off, with a significant increase in website traffic and sales. [SEP] And that was a big moment for us, I think, in the auto vertical. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and expand our offerings, we believe we can maintain this momentum in the auto industry.","1026":"In response to our commitment to supporting micro and small businesses in India, we have recently made a major announcement. [SEP] We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India. [SEP] We believe that these investments will be essential to supporting the long-term digitization of India's economy and helping to build a more sustainable future for all.","1027":"During this quarter, we have seen significant growth in our digital advertising business. We have been investing in our technology to enhance our advertising capabilities and have seen positive results. [SEP] So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and chip with Amazon programs.

We are confident that our investments in our advertising technology will help us capture greater market share and drive long-term growth for our business.","1028":"Our Q3 results have been impressive and we are proud of our team's hard work. [SEP] So I think what you're seeing in terms of year over year and what does it mean for next year, this next quarter, it will be a sequential increase, but again, it is a bit lumpy. [SEP] However, we anticipate some challenges in Q4 due to the uncertainty in the market.","1029":"Can you provide an update on the progress of your expansion plans? [SEP] So I remain optimistic that we'll be able to do work there, but we're just working across a lot of different fronts here because this is a huge space. [SEP] We appreciate your efforts to navigate this complex market and look forward to hearing more in the coming months.","1030":"I'd like to now discuss our expenses for the quarter. [SEP] In addition, growth in infrastructure spend is our large increase in CapEx over the last several years, flows through the income statement as another driver of our expense growth as well. [SEP] However, we believe that this investment in our infrastructure will position us for even greater success in the future.\" \n\nIn addition, growth in infrastructure spend is our large increase in CapEx over the last several years, flows through the income statement as another driver of our expense growth as well. We have been strategically increasing our investments in infrastructure to support our growing business and to improve our overall customer experience.

As a result, we have seen significant improvements in our operational efficiency and a reduction in customer service issues. We are confident that our continued investment in infrastructure will enable us to remain competitive and meet the evolving needs of our customers in the years to come.","1031":"We're seeing good progress in our research and development efforts. [SEP] And if you want to accelerate development, obviously, we need to get our products in the market at a good pace. [SEP] That being said, we need to ensure quality control and regulatory compliance are met before launching our products.","1032":"Our current focus on the domestic market has served us well and has helped us achieve strong financial results. However, as we look to the future, we recognize the need to expand our reach. [SEP] We see that being more balanced over time and being more global as we move forward. [SEP] To this end, we have already started exploring opportunities in international markets and are actively working on establishing partnerships and collaborations. We believe that this shift towards a more global approach will not only increase our revenue streams but also help us diversify our portfolio and mitigate risks.","1033":"We are seeing strong growth in our Watch product, which has become an important part of our overall strategy. In the last quarter, we added several new features to Watch, including the ability to save and share videos. [SEP] And the big thing that unlocked a lot of growth in Watch is we basically were able to move a bunch of the video-watching behavior to a different tab, where people intentionally go to the tab [SEP] sentences: We are continuing to invest in Watch and believe there is significant potential for growth in the coming years. We are exploring new ways to monetize the platform and attract even more users. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made and remain committed to building a world-class video product.","1034":"Despite the challenges we faced this quarter, we remain hopeful and steadfast in our commitment to our long-term strategy.

[SEP] In the short term, we will continue to focus on cost management and efficiency measures to ensure we emerge from this period stronger and more resilient than ever before.","1035":"We've received feedback from our users and advertisers that the content on our platform is not always relevant or high quality. This has led to lower engagement and less successful advertising campaigns. [SEP] And our response has been that we're going to focus on improving the quality and relevance and that's both going to perform better for the people using our services and businesses who are buying ads. [SEP] We're investing resources into better algorithms and content moderation to ensure that only the most informative and valuable content is displayed on our platform. We believe that by improving the user experience, we will see greater engagement and better results for our advertising partners.","1036":"Now I'd like to address the current state of the Chinese market. [SEP] The sort of the economic question which I know there's a bit lot of attention on, frankly, if I were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look how many customers are coming in our stores regardless to whether they're buying, how many people are coming online, and in addition looking at our sales trend, I wouldn't know if there was any economic issue at all in China. [SEP] Of course, we are aware of the concerns surrounding the trade tensions and economic slowdown in China. However, our customer traffic and sales trends indicate a strong demand for our products despite these challenges. We remain confident in our ability to navigate this environment and continue delivering value to our shareholders.","1037":"Can you comment on the areas of your company where you have made investments recently? [SEP] And I will also say that we are \u2013 not all of our investments are on the consumer side. [SEP] That's good to know. Can you give us an example of a recent investment on the b2b side?","1038":"One of the challenges we faced this quarter was driving customer engagement through mobile platforms. [SEP] And setting up a mobile app, getting people to find and download a mobile app, can be even more expensive. [SEP] However, we have identified some cost-effective strategies to increase our mobile app downloads and engagement, such as partnering with social media influencers.","1039":"Now let's take a look at our e-commerce performance for the year. [SEP] Our Amazon Fulfilled units, the amount going through our fulfillment centers and which essentially includes our first-party retail and our FBA sales and it grew nearly 40% over 2016.

[SEP] So there are a few types of systems here that we're working on around understanding content. [SEP] Can you give us some specific examples of how these systems will improve our customer experience?","1041":"We've been monitoring our shareholder composition closely and have noticed some interesting trends that we'd like to share with you today. [SEP] And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might. [SEP] However, these shareholders have been steadfast and supportive of our company for years, and we value their continued investment in our success. Nonetheless, we are actively exploring ways to diversify our shareholder base and attract new investors who share our vision for the future of this company.","1042":"Now I want to highlight a specific international market that has shown significant growth in the past quarter. [SEP] To share one example, an online store in Brazil called Loja Nama, they sell decorative items and accessories.

[SEP] Our team is also working on developing new tools and technologies that can aid us in tackling harmful content on our platform.","1044":"One question that's been on a lot of investors' minds lately is our strategy for our various products and platforms. [SEP] I think it's a good experience inside Facebook, but we also have had examples over time, like Messenger for example, where we started it in Facebook and decided that in order to fulfill their potential, it needed to be its own experience over time. [SEP] So, while we are always looking for ways to enhance the user experience within Facebook, we also recognize that some products may need to stand on their own in order to truly thrive.","1045":"We've noticed a slight dip in revenue over the past quarter. [SEP] It's not due to any change in our aspiration or belief in the growth curve of revenue, and I wanted to be clear on that. [SEP] However, we are evaluating our current strategies and making adjustments to ensure we continue to meet our growth projections.","1046":"We've seen tremendous growth in our smartphone sales in the past quarter.

[SEP] We understand the importance of maintaining transparency with our stakeholders and will provide updates as we make progress in our evaluation.","1048":"Our focus for this quarter has been on optimizing our revenue streams and exploring new opportunities for growth. We're excited to share some of the upcoming projects we've been working on. [SEP] We've got other areas that we're experimenting with like suggested videos, which are going to be very much like those ads in a feed of suggested videos, which are also an opportunity for us. [SEP] We're also working on developing our own version of a music streaming service, which we think has huge potential given the popularity of music on our platform. We're confident that these initiatives will help us to continue our impressive growth trajectory.","1049":"We have been investing heavily in research and development to stay ahead of the curve. [SEP] In fact if you look at our innovation, we're perhaps unique in the large screen innovation that we're doing with Surface Hub, Hollow Lands as well as some of the two-in-one form factors. [SEP] Our customers have been responding well to these products, and we are confident in their continued success. Additionally, we are committed to expanding our product lineup to meet the evolving needs of our customers and the market as a whole.","1050":"We've identified the UK as a key market for our company's expansion efforts. [SEP] I think we're able to do that with Prime Now and get to the UK faster. [SEP] In fact, since launching Prime Now in the UK, we've seen a 30% increase in orders within the first month.","1051":"Now I want to talk about our performance in the wearables category. [SEP] We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. [SEP] And we're continuing to innovate in this space, with exciting new features and designs in the works for future iterations of our watch product.","1052":"One analyst asked about the company's strategy for increasing revenue and improving customer experience. [SEP] But I think the answer is that both of those things are happening and it's key that we do both, not just one. [SEP] We need to focus on driving revenue growth, but we also need to prioritize customer satisfaction in order to maintain loyal customers and attract new ones,\" the CEO responded.","1053":"Now, I want to provide an update on the impact of the Japan consumption tax increase on our business. [SEP] First of all on the -- there were two items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1. [SEP] As we anticipated, the tax increase did create some short-term headwinds in the Japanese market, but we are confident that our long-term growth prospects in the region remain strong.","1054":"Our company has been seeing a lot of demand for our new product format.

People continue to rely on these messaging services to stay connected with their friends and family, especially during these times of social distancing. [SEP] And then there are differences in the feature sets where WhatsApp is extremely utilitarian and focused on texting and now voice calling, whereas Messenger is very focused on expression and the whole set of things that fit into the tools around the Messenger platform that we rolled out at F8, communicating with businesses now, richer tools to communicate in different ways. [SEP] We're also seeing a lot of interest from businesses in using Messenger as a tool for customer service. We've rolled out a number of features, such as chatbots and custom automated messages, that make it easier for businesses to communicate with their customers in a more personalized way. Overall, we're very excited about the continued growth of both WhatsApp and Messenger and the opportunities they present for our business.","1056":"We've made a lot of progress this quarter, and I have to say it's largely due to the leadership team we have in place. [SEP] And I think it's rare that you get someone who's as talented as the folks who are leading this. [SEP] I have complete confidence in their ability to continue driving our success in the future.","1057":"Now we'll move onto the Q&A portion of the call.\"\n- \"Our next question comes from John Smith at XYZ Investment Bank.\"\n- \"Good afternoon, thank you for taking my question.

[SEP] And that is where in macro pressure on occasion shows itself first, and then some of that non-annuity lumpiness. [SEP] However, we do acknowledge that there are some challenges ahead, particularly in terms of increased competition and regulatory scrutiny. We are working hard to adapt to these changing conditions and optimize our operations for maximum efficiency and profitability.","1059":"We have seen strong growth in our sales and revenue over the past quarter. [SEP] And if you have good people leading those teams, then I think you can deliver that over time. [SEP] That's why we're focusing on investing in our employees and continuing to attract top talent to lead our teams.","1060":"We're excited about our new customer service initiative that we've been working on for the past few months. [SEP] We'll also provide \u2013 and giving them targeted recommendations, so making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive. [SEP] This approach has already shown promising results in our pilot program and we expect to see even more positive feedback as we roll it out to our entire customer base.","1061":"During the quarter, we continued to see growth in our user base and revenue streams, but also faced some challenges in navigating regulatory environments. [SEP] And we have to work really closely with regulators to make sure they understand our business practices, understand how we contribute to economic growth in their countries, and understand the steps we take and continue to take to protect privacy. [SEP] Our team is committed to maintaining open lines of communication with regulators and addressing any concerns they may have. We believe that transparency and collaboration with government entities is key to the success of our business.","1062":"We're pleased to report strong earnings growth for the quarter, with revenue up by 15% year-over-year. [SEP] And it also plays into the fact that we're seeing good growth in places like India, Mexico, Brazil, and others. [SEP] Our strategy of expanding into emerging markets is paying off, and we're confident that this trend will continue over the coming quarters.","1063":"We're excited to discuss some of the technological advancements we've been implementing this quarter. [SEP] So machine learning is \u2013 the improvement there are by far the largest technological trends that we're seeing in the industry and across the business. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to integrate these technologies into our products and services to better meet the needs of our customers.","1064":"We are seeing a significant shift in the market towards cloud-based solutions. [SEP] But at the same time, we still will focus on those deals moving to the cloud over time. [SEP] Our strategy is to continue investing in cloud technology and services to meet this demand.","1065":"Our revenue for the quarter exceeded expectations, showing a growth of 12% year over year. This was due to strong demand for our cloud-based services and a continued shift towards subscriptions. [SEP] because if you think about the $1 billion plus beat we had for the unearned, it was due to the fact that we had very good mix shift Office 365 in terms of billings in the quarter, almost very little of that gets recognized in quarter. [SEP] We are confident that the momentum will continue into the next quarter. We expect even stronger growth in our cloud offerings and continued adoption of our Office 365 subscription service. Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and look forward to continuing to deliver value to our shareholders.","1066":"Our team has been working diligently to streamline our supply chain and optimize inventory levels.

[SEP] Also the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1, and what we saw was a pre-buy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter, and based on our history with the last time the consumption tax went up many years ago, we\u2019ve expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to navigate this challenge and continue delivering value to our customers in Japan.","1068":"Thank you for joining us today for our earnings conference call. We are excited to report strong growth in our services division and continued momentum across all of our lines of business. As we navigate the current market environment, we remain focused on delivering value to our customers while driving innovation and growth. [SEP] And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but that\u2019s why I tend to not focus at that layer it\u2019s like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time you\u2019d expect a higher mix of premium versus core. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to sustain this momentum and capture new opportunities in the market. We are actively investing in our digital capabilities, expanding our product offerings, and deepening our relationships with key partners and stakeholders. With our strong balance sheet, diverse revenue streams, and talented team, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Thank you again for your time and support.","1069":"We've been getting a lot of questions about our decision to introduce new reaction buttons on the platform. I just want to take a moment to explain our thinking behind this. [SEP] But the philosophy behind it is that when you only have a like button, if you share a sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it. [SEP] That's why we decided to introduce a range of emotions people can use to react to posts. You'll now be able to express a wider range of emotions, allowing for more meaningful interactions on the platform. We're really excited to see how people use these new features and what impact they'll have on the community.","1070":"We recognize that this transition to the cloud is a significant undertaking, but we are fully committed to it. Our goal is to accelerate our digital transformation and ensure that we remain competitive in our industry. [SEP] And frankly, inherent in the conversation around moving to the cloud with the aggressive targets we've given, that is implied, to your point. [SEP] We have already made significant progress in our cloud migration efforts. Our teams are working diligently to ensure that we meet our targets and deliver value to our customers. We are confident that this move to the cloud will position us for long-term success.","1071":"Our international expansion has been a key focus for us this year.\n- We've been working hard to expand our brand presence in Asia.\n- I'm pleased to report that our efforts in China have been paying off.

[SEP] Additionally, our Services team is working to expand our offerings to new markets, which we expect will contribute to continued growth and margin accretion.","1073":"Our company has always been committed to pushing the boundaries of innovation in the technology industry. [SEP] One of the things that I feel very good about is the risk we took to introduce the two-in-one category and I feel now that we see that in fact inspire even a lot of activity in our own OEM ecosystem and we see many good designs coming out. [SEP] With this success, we will continue to invest in new product categories and take risks that will set us apart from our competitors.","1074":"Moving on to our iPhone sales performance, we are pleased to report that the demand remained strong despite the ongoing pandemic. [SEP] This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year and that is true in total and it's true for Greater China as well. [SEP] As we continue to focus on managing our channel inventory efficiently, we expect to see the benefits of our efforts reflected in our financial performance in the upcoming quarters.","1075":"We have invested heavily in improving our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. This has allowed us to enhance the user experience and provide more relevant content to our users. [SEP] So for example, that means being able to read and understand news articles or posts that people make or messages that a person might send to a business so we can help that business auto-reply to them and get information back to the person really quickly, or understand the content so we can better understand what might be interesting to a person and show it in News Feed. [SEP] Our AI capabilities have also allowed us to improve our ad targeting. By analyzing user data, we can show ads that are more likely to be of interest to each individual user. This benefits both users, who see more relevant ads, and advertisers, who can achieve a higher ROI.","1076":"Thank you all for joining us today on our earnings conference call. I'm pleased to report that our company has made significant progress in achieving our financial goals this quarter. We've also been hard at work improving our customer engagement strategies. [SEP] because the entire idea was to be able to have a full conversation around the data as stated with customers. [SEP] We've received positive feedback from our customers regarding the new data visualization tool we recently rolled out. We've seen a significant uptick in engagement with our platform, and we believe this is due in large part to the enhanced user experience. Moving forward, we plan to continue prioritizing customer feedback and investing in our technology to ensure we remain at the forefront of the industry.","1077":"We've been closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on our business. [SEP] So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either. [SEP] However, we're confident that our strategic investments and cost-cutting measures will position us for growth in the second half of the year.","1078":"We are dedicated to maximizing the value we bring to our customers and shareholders.

Our commitment to strong ROI allows us to confidently pursue growth opportunities and expand our offerings.","1079":"We've been seeing a shift in our customers' needs and preferences. [SEP] And increasingly, that's why we've been talking a bit about the form of these contracts changing, larger commitments being made that are -- that land in bookings but not in unearned, right? [SEP] This change in contract format allows us to better align with our customers and provide more value to them.","1080":"Now turning to our financial performance this quarter... [SEP] We had \u2013 what I attribute it to is continued strength in our \u2013 some of our most profitable areas. [SEP] As we look to the future, we remain committed to investing in and growing these key areas of our business.","1081":"Now moving on to our revenue growth. As you can see from the numbers, we have experienced a steady increase in revenue over the past year. Our team has worked hard to develop and implement new strategies to drive growth and we are pleased with the results we are seeing. [SEP] And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. [SEP] Looking ahead to the next quarter, we expect to see continued growth and anticipate reaching revenues of 175 million. We are also excited to announce a new partnership that will expand our market reach and provide new opportunities for growth in the future.","1082":"The revenue guidance we provided for the next quarter is largely driven by the current market trends and our sales pipeline. [SEP] It also takes into account the ongoing investments we're making in the longer-term innovation work, which I don't think will necessarily have any meaningful revenue relative to the size of the business in those time frames. [SEP] However, we believe that the investments we're making in innovation are critical for the long-term growth of our company and will position us well for future success.","1083":"Now let's turn our focus to our advertising platform. [SEP] Eighty-three percent of the overall inventory on the platform is native, and over 50% of our publishers are only using native ads. [SEP] This continued growth in native advertising is a testament to the effectiveness of this format and the value it provides for both our advertisers and publishers.","1084":"We have been continuously investing in research and development to bring innovative products to the market. Our efforts have resulted in a strong pipeline of devices that we are confident will address the evolving needs of our customers.

[SEP] We are also expanding our distribution network to reach out to more customers in different regions. Our marketing campaigns are in full swing to create awareness and generate demand for our products. We are optimistic about the upcoming quarter and expect to see robust sales growth driven by our exciting product lineup.","1085":"We are pleased to report strong earnings for this quarter. [SEP] because of the year ago quarter also had catch up in it from Q1. [SEP] However, it is important to note that our current quarter results are not directly comparable to the year ago quarter because of the catch up in Q1.","1086":"As we move forward into the next quarter, we want to focus on some important initiatives that will drive our profitability and growth. [SEP] Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. [SEP] We're confident that by banking these investments and gaining greater control over our operations, we'll be able to continue delivering strong results for our shareholders.","1087":"We've made significant investments in cybersecurity measures over the past year. [SEP] But we now have management data protection and identity systems that cross all devices in the enterprise, including the Internet of Things, and that makes it pretty exciting. [SEP] This has not only improved our ability to protect our own data, but also gives us a competitive advantage when it comes to offering secure solutions to our clients.","1088":"Our company's focus is on providing specialized software solutions to various industry verticals. We believe that creating applications that cater to specific job roles will lead to more productivity and efficiency for our clients. [SEP] In order to do that, you obviously need apps that are written to specific jobs, not just apps that are general productivity apps like work processors and spreadsheets and presentation tools et cetera. [SEP] Therefore, we are investing heavily in our research and development to create industry-specific apps for our clients. We have already launched a product for the healthcare industry, and we plan to expand our offerings to other sectors such as finance, retail, and manufacturing. Our goal is to become the go-to provider of tailor-made software solutions for businesses worldwide.","1089":"We've seen a decline in our revenue over the past few quarters due to the economic downturn.

[SEP] Our team has been working hard to implement cost-saving measures and explore new revenue streams to bring us back to growth.","1090":"We have had a lot of success with our new line of supplements. [SEP] It's worth noting this isn't a feed product, so there are some more unknowns here. [SEP] However, we have confidence in the research behind this product and believe it has strong potential in the market.","1091":"We recognize that the market has become increasingly competitive in recent years, with new players entering at a rapid pace. [SEP] And that's where, if you will, our fair share will come from by competing hard where we have to but also mostly thinking about differentiation. [SEP] We are confident that our focus on differentiation will allow us to maintain our market position and continue to grow our business over the long-term.","1092":"We have seen tremendous growth in our cloud computing segment over the past quarter. [SEP] So there actually is some Azure Benefit revenue ultimately that shows \"is on-prem. [SEP] However, we also understand that some customers prefer to keep their data and applications on-premises for security or compliance reasons.","1093":"Our company was able to withstand the pressure brought on by the local competition. [SEP] The local competition was obviously there this quarter and has been there for many quarters before. [SEP] Despite this challenge, we are confident in our ability to continue to outperform and provide value to our customers.","1094":"We're really excited about the new product release and we think it's going to be a game changer in the industry. The development team has been working hard on this for months and we're very proud of what they've accomplished.

[SEP] We've already had a lot of interest from potential customers and we expect sales to be strong in the coming months. This is just one of many innovative products that we have in the pipeline, so stay tuned for more exciting developments from our company.","1095":"We've been asked a lot recently about when we'll start lapping the tougher growth comps on AWS, so I want to address that question head-on. As you know, AWS has been growing rapidly for many years, and as we discussed the past several quarters, our year-over-year growth rates have been impacted by the extraordinary impact of COVID-19 on our business last year. [SEP] On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside, so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. [SEP] Looking at the first quarter, AWS revenue grew 32% year-over-year to $13.5 billion, driven by strong customer usage growth and usage per customer, including increased use of our services for video streaming, remote learning, and collaboration. We continue to see a lot of demand for our services, particularly for machine learning, analytics, and containers, and we're excited about the opportunity ahead.","1096":"As we look at the growth of our teams, it's important to note that they are not just focused on one area. We are expanding our reach into multiple categories, which presents a unique opportunity for us to create a more interconnected platform. [SEP] Teams really expand multiple categories, so I wouldn't think of adjusted productivity or even just collab or meetings but as an interface. [SEP] By developing an interface that allows for seamless collaboration and communication across various categories, we can increase productivity and drive better business outcomes. This approach is already paying off, with strong adoption rates among our existing customer base and promising growth potential in new markets.","1097":"Now, I'd like to turn our attention to our international segment. [SEP] The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth. [SEP] Overall, we're excited about the growth opportunities in both our domestic and international segments, particularly through our FBA program and Amazon fulfillment network.","1098":"We have had tremendous growth in the past quarter, with revenue increasing by 25%. Our market share has also increased significantly, and we are pleased with the direction the company is headed in. [SEP] And so it's huge, and we felt it was important to spell that out. [SEP] As we continue to expand our product line and enter new markets, we believe our growth will only continue. Our team is dedicated to meeting the demands of our customers and providing innovative solutions. We are confident that the future looks bright for our company.","1099":"During the quarter, there were several notable events that occurred in the media. [SEP] Last week there was this case where someone was using Facebook Live to broadcast \u2013 or was thinking about suicide. [SEP] As a company, we take our responsibility to promote safety and well-being on our platform very seriously, and we are constantly working to improve our tools and resources to help prevent such incidents from happening.","1100":"Thank you for joining our earnings conference call today, where we will review our financial results for the most recent quarter. We are pleased to report another strong performance, with revenue growth of 10% year over year. [SEP] So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter. [SEP] As we look ahead, we remain focused on driving sustainable growth through innovation and strategic investments. We expect to continue to invest in our people, our products, and our infrastructure, which we believe will position us for long-term success. Thank you again for your interest and support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.","1101":"As we move into the next quarter, I'd like to take a moment to address our strategic initiatives and the investments we're making to continue to grow our platform. We're focused on investing in areas that will allow us to scale our business and offer more value to our users. [SEP] And those three factors are the ones that I outlined in my commentary: number one, the substantial investment that Mark highlighted that we're making to just improve the security on our platform; two, the video content investments we're making for Watch tab; and then three, additional investments we're making in the long term initiatives like AR\/VR, AI, and connectivity. [SEP] While these investments may impact our short-term profitability, we believe they are critical to our long-term success and will ultimately lead to better outcomes for our shareholders. We're already seeing positive results from some of these initiatives, including increased engagement on the Watch tab and improved user trust in our platform. We remain committed to investing in our future and delivering on our mission to connect the world.","1102":"We often get questions about our ability to weather economic downturns. [SEP] There are some elements that we understand quite well and we tend to manage well over the course of the cycle. [SEP] However, we acknowledge that there are also factors outside of our control that can impact our performance.","1103":"Our strategy for growth has three key elements. [SEP] First, building a consumer use case; then, second, making it so that people can organically interact with businesses; and then third, on top of that, once there's a large volume of people interacting with businesses. [SEP] We believe that this approach will lead to sustainable growth for our company.","1104":"Can you give us an update on the company's expansion plans in India? [SEP] So India is a unique country where there are 1.25 billion people, more than 1 billion of them are not on the Internet. [SEP] What is the company doing to reach these potential customers and bring them online?\" \"Do you see this as a significant growth opportunity for the company?","1105":"One of the things that's been really pleasing in the last couple of years is the acceleration of our enterprise migrations to the cloud. We're seeing customers now move their most important workloads to AWS. [SEP] Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins. [SEP] And as we continue to innovate and expand our offerings, we believe this trend will only continue. Overall, we're very encouraged by the growth we're seeing in AWS and the opportunities ahead.","1106":"Now let's turn to our growth trajectory for the coming year. [SEP] because, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our installed base of customers and devices is growing, and is growing very significantly [SEP] This expansion has enabled us to capture a larger share of the market and generate more recurring revenue from our existing customers.","1107":"During the quarter, our marketing team ran a successful campaign using Facebook Messenger ads to promote our latest LEGO sets. [SEP] They reached people over 25 years old in the U.S., UK, France and Germany, and targeted people who are interested in LEGO toys and shopping, and they found a 3.4 times higher return on ad spend for click-to-Messenger ads versus those that just linked to the LEGO website. [SEP] We plan to continue leveraging Messenger ads in our upcoming marketing campaigns, as we have seen positive results and higher engagement rates with this platform.","1108":"Our team has been working hard on developing new ad formats and we're excited to announce our latest addition. [SEP] And I think the way people largely think about this is this is another way of using the Facebook ad system, including our targeting and measurement capabilities, to create ads that are great creative that can reach people. [SEP] We've already seen great success with this new ad format, with a 30% increase in click-through rates compared to traditional ads.","1109":"We understand the importance of managing content in an efficient and effective manner, particularly given recent concerns about the spread of misinformation and inappropriate content on our platform. [SEP] I think that we have some confidence in that timeframe, which takes us through the end of about 2019, to get our systems to the level that we generally think that they should be at, where we're building AI systems that can flag content that might be problematic to a much larger security and review team that can manage the larger volume of stuff that our tools are flagging to them. [SEP] In addition to our AI and security efforts, we are also investing in improving our review processes and training our team members to be more adept at identifying and addressing potentially problematic content.","1110":"We've been looking at ways to optimize our portfolio and make sure that each product we have is delivering the maximum value to our users. [SEP] Some of them get clear value by being separate, like Messenger, for example, where we can make sure that everyone has their push notifications turned on, which is extremely important for a messaging app. [SEP] On the other hand, we've found that integrating certain services can create a more seamless user experience and ultimately drive engagement and growth across our platform.","1111":"Now let's turn our attention to the revenue numbers for this quarter. As you can see from the report, we experienced a 10% sequential decline. This is not entirely unexpected given the challenging business environment we are operating in. [SEP] So when you take those factors into account, I think that explains the sequential decline that we see this year. [SEP] However, I would like to highlight that our year-over-year revenue growth is still strong at 20%. We have also taken steps to mitigate the impact of the factors mentioned earlier. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to navigate through these challenges and deliver value to our shareholders.","1112":"Our priority is to improve our customers' experience by providing fast and reliable shipping options. [SEP] We've in the past months significantly expanded our one-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for one-day shipping. [SEP] As a result, we've seen a substantial increase in customer satisfaction scores and a significant boost in sales.","1113":"One analyst on the call asked about the expected impact on EPS from an acquisition that had recently been announced. [SEP] The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS dilution on \u2013 excluding the impact of purchase accounting, being minimally dilutive, 1% plus or minus, stands, including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses. [SEP] The CEO added that the company is confident in its ability to integrate the acquisition smoothly and deliver on the synergies that had been identified. They also reiterated their commitment to shareholder value and said that they were excited about the potential for growth in the coming quarters.","1114":"We\u2019re very pleased to report strong growth in our third quarter earnings. [SEP] They\u2019ve had great success on our site, the -- more than half of our units sold are from third party sellers. [SEP] Third party sellers have become an increasingly important part of our business model and we expect this trend to continue in the future.","1115":"As we move forward with our sustainability goals, it's important to consider all aspects of our supply chain. [SEP] When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece [SEP] We have been working with our suppliers to implement more sustainable practices, and measuring the impact of these changes will be key in achieving our goals.","1116":"Now, moving on to our product categories. [SEP] There is a wide variety of products included in that category: smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. [SEP] But despite the wide variety of products, we have seen a significant increase in sales in this category over the past quarter.","1117":"Can you speak to how your products are able to serve different industries and market segments? [SEP] For the most part, when we build products, we build them to work for all verticals, and you see us do that. [SEP] However, have you considered creating products tailored specifically to certain verticals in order to capture more market share in those areas?","1118":"During the quarter, we continued to focus on growing our small business user base. [SEP] We announced last year that we have over 50 million small business pages active on a monthly basis. [SEP] This growth in small business pages has resulted in a significant increase in advertising revenue for the company.","1119":"Our software has been performing exceptionally well this quarter, and we are pleased with the strong growth we have seen so far. [SEP] They're consistent, the dynamic mix in terms of emerging markets and developed as well as enterprise sizing is not an ASP problem in Pro. [SEP] Additionally, our customer retention rates remain high, which is a testament to the value our software brings to businesses of all sizes.","1120":"We've been closely monitoring the growth and development of augmented reality technology in various industries. [SEP] There's a lot of interest out there and the number of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping, to I was in China a few weeks ago and saw AR in an art sense, in an art exhibit. [SEP] Our team is exploring potential partnerships and investment opportunities in this space to stay ahead of the competition and provide value to our customers.","1121":"One area of potential growth we have been closely monitoring is our Stories feature. [SEP] We do think there's opportunities to improve the value of the Stories format that will translate into better price for Stories. [SEP] Our team is currently researching ways to enhance the user experience of Stories and provide advertisers with more targeted and effective advertising options.","1122":"Our messaging platform has been on the rise in terms of usage and engagement, particularly among younger demographics who prioritize convenience and privacy. [SEP] In terms of transactions, one of the big things that we see happening in messaging long term is that it's a great channel for people to interact with a business one on one and either do transactions in a private space or get support, or for businesses to reach out with very personally tailored messages and have an ongoing engagement with a person. [SEP] We're investing heavily in our messaging capabilities and exploring new ways to enhance the user experience, such as integrating shopping and payment features. We believe this will drive increased user adoption and ultimately lead to higher revenue growth for the company.","1123":"Our supply chain had to reconfigure itself significantly due to the pandemic. \n- We've been monitoring customer demand, and we see a very positive trend for the upcoming fiscal quarter. [SEP] And we purchase that glass and essentially export it to the world with iPhones and iPads. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with our performance this quarter, especially considering the challenges we faced. \n- Our team is already working on initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce costs further.","1124":"We are very pleased with how our recent digital ad campaign performed. [SEP] What's nice is that the same targeting, the same measurement systems really work. [SEP] We believe this consistency can help us optimize our marketing efforts and drive stronger results in the future.","1125":"Thank you for your question about our current royalty payments. [SEP] In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. [SEP] We are actively working to resolve the disagreement and reach a fair agreement that works for all parties involved.","1126":"Can you explain how the Dynamic Product Ads (DPA) process works in terms of bidding for ad placement? [SEP] So it doesn't necessarily mean you're paying a premium for a given product and so if we've got a good DPA ad that might win in the auction for a given user. [SEP] This allows us to maximize our return on investment while still providing relevant ads to our users.","1127":"We will now open up the call for questions. [SEP] Your first question on international, yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. [SEP] In our next fiscal year, we plan to expand our international presence even further.","1128":"Our e-commerce business is continuing to thrive and has seen significant growth in the past quarter. [SEP] I think we launched a couple more Prime Now cities just today, so that brings us up to about 17 across the globe. [SEP] We are also seeing strong demand for our grocery delivery services, which has exceeded our initial projections.","1129":"As we move into the next quarter, let's take a closer look at our financials. [SEP] If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we got an expense to revenue ratio of 9%. [SEP] This represents a slight increase from our previous quarter, but we are confident in our ability to manage expenses while continuing to drive revenue growth.","1130":"Our next question comes from John from JP Morgan. John, over to you. [SEP] And frankly over time and watching, I think both the creativity and the pace of innovation we\u2019ve seen coming out of our engineering teams particularly in Azure and Office 365 and our CRM team online, I actually even have more confidence in our ability to attach and grow that gross profit over time. [SEP] Thank you. Our last question comes from Jane from Goldman Sachs. Jane, over to you.\n\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. CEO for any additional or closing remarks. \n\nCEO: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased with our strong Q2 results and remain optimistic about our future growth prospects. Our teams continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions to our customers and driving value for our shareholders. We appreciate the support of our investors and look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. Thank you.","1131":"We've seen a lot of growth in our advertising platform this quarter and we're pleased with the results. Our focus has been on improving the platform's targeting capabilities. [SEP] In terms of ROI on the platform, the ROI is really determined by the ability of advertisers to put the right ad in front of the right person in the right format. [SEP] To that end, we're continuing to invest in our data analytics and machine learning capabilities. We believe that this will enable us to deliver even better results for our advertisers in the future. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that every ad on our platform delivers real value for both advertisers and users.","1132":"We're now seeing strong growth in our consumer segment, with the number of users increasing steadily over the past few quarters. [SEP] Once we've built this installed base up to 18 million users on the consumer side, that recurring rate does in fact offset the deferral from new, and so it is an important inflection point for us this quarter. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're confident that we can continue to build our installed base and drive strong recurring revenue growth, which is a key priority for us moving forward.","1133":"Thank you for your question, we believe that the future of our company lies in the continued success of our cloud-based services. [SEP] And that will be a constant battle between, again, growth, geographic expansion in AWS and also efficiencies to limit how much we actually need. [SEP] Additionally, we are always exploring new technologies and innovations to help us achieve both growth and efficiency in our operations.","1134":"We have seen some fluctuations in our revenue over the past few quarters. [SEP] I think it tends to not be as big a factor, sequentially quarter-over-quarter is the gradual growth in it. [SEP] However, we anticipate that our latest product launch will significantly increase our revenue in the next quarter. Our team is also working on improving our marketing strategies to drive more sales in the upcoming months.","1135":"Now I would like to touch on some of the changes we've made at Facebook over the past few months. [SEP] One is that we just started getting a lot of feedback from people in the community that they wanted Facebook to be more about connecting with people, which is really the core of what it's always been, less so about viral videos or news content and just passive consumption. [SEP] In response to this feedback, we have made a number of changes to the news feed algorithm to prioritize posts from friends, family, and groups over public content.","1136":"During the quarter, our advertising campaigns did not perform as well as we had anticipated. We experienced lower than expected click-through rates and lower conversion rates. [SEP] They are only about 65% accurate in demographic targeting, they don't work on mobile because they are cookie based, they don't work on multiple devices, they don't go off-line to on-line and they overemphasize the last click and reach. [SEP] These challenges are not unique to our company, as advertisers across the industry are facing similar issues. We are exploring alternative advertising methods, such as influencer marketing and native advertising. Additionally, we are investing in improving our targeting and attribution capabilities to drive better results for our advertising partners.","1137":"As we review our progress in the gaming segment, we are thrilled to see promising results from our Mixer platform. [SEP] And we feel very, very good about the engagement increases in a pretty unique value proposition we have in Mixer. [SEP] Our team is continuously working on improving the platform and adding more features to make it an even better experience for our users. We are excited to see what the future holds for Mixer as we continue to strive for growth and success in the gaming market.","1138":"We've continued to see strong adoption of our business solutions among our customers. This quarter, we saw a 20% increase in usage and a 15% increase in new customer acquisition. [SEP] And clearly that's increasing engagement as well and that obviously then translates into revenue growth of those business solutions we mentioned. [SEP] We believe that this momentum will continue as our customers increasingly realize the value that our solutions can bring to their businesses. In the coming quarters, we will continue to invest in innovation and expanding our product offerings to meet their evolving needs.","1139":"One analyst asked about the company's strategy for acquiring new businesses to its network. [SEP] So instead of focusing on ads first, what we did was we built pages, and we made that free, that way as many businesses as possible could get into the network. [SEP] This approach has proven successful, and we now have over 50 million businesses using our pages to connect with customers. As a result, we've been able to leverage this network for advertising and generate significant revenue.","1140":"Our team has been focused on expanding and innovating in our core business, and we've seen a lot of success there. [SEP] And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there is a lot of headroom there in our mind, and so we are working very hard to realize that opportunity. [SEP] We've also been exploring some new markets and opportunities, which we believe have the potential to drive even more growth. As always, we're committed to investing in our people and infrastructure to ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders.","1141":"We've been investing heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities in recent years. [SEP] But the combination of building AI and hiring what is going to be tens of thousands of people to work on these problems, I think will see us make very meaningful progress going forward. [SEP] Our ultimate goal is to use these technologies to improve the lives of people all around the world, whether it's through more efficient healthcare, better transportation systems, or more effective disaster response.","1142":"We've noticed that there's been some concern around the volatility in our quarterly results, and we wanted to take the time to address that today. [SEP] And so the inherent volatility that you are talking about really is about changes in-quarter that we see and the impact of that. [SEP] That being said, we're confident in our ability to manage this volatility and remain focused on our long-term goals for the company.","1143":"Our profits have been lower than expected for the past quarter. [SEP] However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. [SEP] That being said, we have made significant investments in infrastructure and anticipate seeing the benefits of that in the coming months.","1144":"Our international expansion strategy has been a major focus for us. [SEP] We rolled out Prime last summer if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there. [SEP] We've seen a significant increase in Prime memberships and engagement in that market since launching these services.","1145":"We have seen tremendous growth in our company over the past year. [SEP] So, to me staying with that and staying focused on our unique contribution is perhaps are both on opportunity and our challenge and we will obviously index on the opportunity side. [SEP] By continuing to focus on our unique contribution, we believe we can continue this upward trend in the future.","1146":"Now let's discuss our performance in the first quarter of the fiscal year. [SEP] This quarter in Q1 we were up 60 basis points year-over-year in total at the upper end of that forecast implied would be up 80 basis points, so again, that\u2019s the range and we think its appropriate range for Q2. [SEP] We are confident that our strategic initiatives will continue to drive growth and provide value for our shareholders.","1147":"Now turning to our company's growth strategy. [SEP] The analogy that I always use is the first smartphones came out in 2003, right, the BlackBerry and Palm Treo, and it took 10 years to get to 1 billion units. [SEP] And I believe that we are on a similar path with our product.","1148":"We're often asked about our approach to advertising and how we've been able to maintain a strong revenue stream while keeping our users engaged. I think it comes down to a fundamentally different approach that we took early on in the company's history. [SEP] where if you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the experience, and what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and monetization would perform better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses. [SEP] I'm happy to report that our strategy has proven successful. Our revenue growth has been consistent year over year, and we've been able to maintain a high level of user engagement. We believe this is because we've prioritized building a platform that connects users with businesses in a natural, authentic way.","1149":"Our quarterly earnings report shows strong growth across all our product lines and geographies. [SEP] That\u2019s happening not just because of frontline workers, but also continued expansion and continued movement in every segment where we see the opportunity to increase the installed base. [SEP] We are also investing heavily in research and development to ensure we stay ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and technology. Overall, we are optimistic about the future and look forward to continuing to deliver value to our shareholders.","1150":"Now let's move on to our international operations. [SEP] So we're happy with the launch in the UK and the team did a great job to get that launch in a timely manner. [SEP] We're looking forward to expanding into new markets in the coming year.","1151":"We've seen a lot of success in our digital marketing efforts over the past quarter. Our team has been working hard to optimize our online presence and social media strategy, and it's paid off in increased engagement and sales. [SEP] So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that. [SEP] Of course, we're always looking for ways to improve and adapt to changes in consumer behavior. One area where we see potential for growth is in influencer partnerships, and we plan to explore that avenue more in the coming months. But overall, we're confident that our strong digital marketing capabilities will continue to drive our business forward.","1152":"Our cloud platform continues to gain traction in the market, and we are thrilled to report another quarter of strong growth. As more customers shift towards cloud-based solutions, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. [SEP] And we see nice attach as far as EAs to the cloud as well and that's definitely a big driver of our growth. [SEP] Additionally, we have seen an increase in demand for our professional services offerings, which has further contributed to our revenue growth. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the future and are committed to delivering innovative products and services to our customers.","1153":"We've seen really strong growth this quarter and we're excited to share some of the details with you now. [SEP] And even when we make it super easy for people to get their ads into the right format, from the smallest mom-and-pop to the largest brands, people want to understand the creative of their ad and it needs to be in a format they feel comfortable. [SEP] So while we're improving our tools to make ad creation easier and more accessible, we're also committed to providing the flexibility and customization that our clients need to create impactful ads. We believe that striking the right balance between simplifying the process and offering creative freedom will continue to be the key to our success in this space.","1154":"Our company has always focused on the needs of our customers and making sure they have the best experience possible. We have been closely monitoring the changing trends and behaviors of our consumers to adapt and improve our offerings. [SEP] And I mean really looking at that, the goal is to make customers' lives easier and make it more convenient and a lot of that is you're seeing that in the homes and to some extent on the Go. [SEP] We have also been investing heavily in our technology and infrastructure to ensure seamless delivery and accessibility. We want to be the go-to source for our customers, whether they are at home or on the go. Through our continued efforts, we are confident we can achieve these goals and continue to exceed expectations.","1155":"We had a strong quarter and are very pleased with our financial results. [SEP] So there's a lot of moving parts, usually our headwinds to our unit growth number, but again happy with the 800 basis point quarter-over-quarter jump in that. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued momentum in our unit growth as we expand our product offerings and explore new markets.","1156":"We had a very strong quarter, with solid revenue growth across all of our business segments. Mobile continues to be our biggest source of revenue, with our app downloads and engagement metrics showing strong gains. [SEP] And I could not be more excited about AR and what we're seeing with ARKit in the early going. [SEP] Looking ahead, we have several exciting product launches in the pipeline, including new features for our flagship app and partnerships with leading brands in the fashion and beauty space. We're also exploring opportunities in the virtual reality space, and believe that this technology will play a major role in the future of entertainment and commerce.","1157":"Our analysts have reviewed all our forecasts and projections, and we're excited to share our outlook for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] We expect those two factors to be offset by positive leverage, because you've seen the revenue guidance that we provided and the mix to services that you've actually mentioned during your question. [SEP] Overall, we remain optimistic about our ability to achieve our financial targets and continue to grow our business in the current market environment.","1158":"During the first quarter, we continued to see strong demand for our cloud services, and we are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum going forward. Our revenue from cloud services grew by 20% year-over-year, driven by a combination of increased usage and new customer acquisitions. [SEP] And so we have a lot of value that is across the board cloud services, whether it's Xbox Live, Windows Update, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and of course all of the Azure services. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are focused on expanding our cloud offerings even further, both through the creation of new services and features and through strategic partnerships with other industry leaders. We are committed to providing our customers with the most comprehensive and reliable cloud solutions on the market today, and we believe that our strong financial performance in this area is a testament to the success of this approach. Thank you for joining us on today's call, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.","1159":"Can you provide more clarity on where our largest bucket of spend is allocated? [SEP] I think when you think about what bucket of spend that is in, which is a question we get, it really is both marketing spend and any other spend companies have where they're reaching their customers, of which if you think about marketing spend and customer service spend, marketing spend is way bigger [SEP] But it's important to remember that customer service spend is also crucial in creating a positive customer experience and can ultimately impact our bottom line.","1160":"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, with overall revenue up 8% year over year. Today, we'll be focusing on our AWS segment, which continues to be a key driver of our growth. [SEP] So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to continue delivering value to our customers with innovative new products and services. We're particularly excited about the potential for our machine learning offerings, which we believe will be a major differentiator for us in the years to come. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.","1161":"One of our top priorities this quarter has been to continue developing our Watch platform. [SEP] So the Watch behaviors that we're building is one where people come intentionally to watch specific videos and to interact with the community around that. [SEP] We have seen great success with this approach, as engagement and watch time on the platform have both increased significantly.","1162":"Now, moving on to our financial performance for the year. [SEP] But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out. [SEP] First, our procurement team has done an excellent job negotiating favorable contracts with our suppliers, resulting in significant savings on raw material costs. Additionally, our IT team has successfully implemented streamlined processes and automation tools, leading to lower labor costs in our operations. Finally, our sales and marketing team has executed targeted campaigns that have generated strong returns on investment while keeping costs in check. Overall, our focus on cost management has been a major contributor to our strong financial performance this year.","1163":"We've seen continued growth on Instagram, but it's important to keep in mind that it's still a relatively new platform for us. [SEP] Instagram remains small relative to Facebook and it's going to really take time to have significant impact on our growth. [SEP] That being said, we're investing in new features and expanding our advertising options on Instagram, which we believe will help drive growth in the long term.","1164":"Our expansion into the European market has been a major focus over the past year. [SEP] We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers.

We believe that this approach will help us create sustainable value for our customers and shareholders over the long term.","1166":"We have been investing heavily in the development of our VR platform, Oculus, and we're excited about the progress that we've made so far. Our goal has been to create a complete ecosystem that enables users to experience immersive, interactive content in a way that has never been possible before. [SEP] But as we do arrangements to get the ecosystem going, some of that could get picked up in sales and marketing, and then we have content as well that's getting picked up in R&D for the efforts we're making with Oculus. [SEP] We believe that the potential for VR is enormous, and we're committed to investing in this technology for the long term. We're already seeing strong interest from consumers and content creators alike, and we're working hard to build out a robust ecosystem that will support the growth of this market. We're confident that our efforts will pay off in the coming years as VR becomes more mainstream and more widely adopted.","1167":"We've seen incredible growth in our user base over the past year, with more and more people turning to our platform for their daily dose of news and entertainment. [SEP] And you can imagine that as the tools for any of this content get better, people taking photos, newspapers, writing news articles, advertisers, putting out ads for content that they want to sell, the better that content gets, the more people are excited to see it and then that informs the ranking in what the community qualitatively tells us that they want to see from us over time as well. [SEP] We're continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and algorithms to provide the most relevant and high-quality content to our users, and are confident that this focus on quality will continue to drive growth and engagement on our platform.","1168":"We've seen significant growth in the number of users who are using Messenger to communicate and engage with our platform.

Thank you.","1170":"Now, moving on to our financial results. I am pleased to announce that we exceeded our revenue projections for the quarter. [SEP] Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. [SEP] This was largely due to strong sales in our international markets and the successful launch of our new product line. We believe this momentum will continue into the next quarter and the rest of the fiscal year.","1171":"Let's talk about our projections for the second quarter of this fiscal year. [SEP] But sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to monitor market conditions and make adjustments as needed, but we don't anticipate any major surprises.","1172":"We've been focusing heavily on incorporating artificial intelligence into our platform.

[SEP] We have seen an increase in user engagement over the past quarter and we plan to continue to offer compelling content to keep users on our platform.","1175":"Now let's move on to discuss our performance in international markets. [SEP] Switching outside of China was up year-on-year, and so we're happy with that. [SEP] However, we still see significant potential for growth in China and will continue to invest in expanding our presence there.","1176":"We've seen significant growth in our technology division over the past year, driven by strategic investments in emerging technologies. I'm pleased to say that we've achieved some very promising results as a result of these investments. [SEP] The things that I would point to are things like AI as well as our investments in AR and VR.

As we look to the future, we remain committed to exploring new ways to leverage these technologies to enhance our business and deliver even greater value to our customers.","1177":"Our focus on improving the user experience and introducing new features has strengthened engagement on the platform.

[SEP] Additionally, we have been working closely with businesses to develop effective advertising strategies on Instagram, which has resulted in significant revenue growth for the company.","1178":"We've been working to improve our fact-checking process and ensure the accuracy of the information we provide. [SEP] What we basically ask people we don't want to assess by ourselves which sources are trustworthy. [SEP] This has become especially important as we've seen an increase in fake news and misinformation being spread online.","1179":"We've been working hard to improve our targeting capabilities over the past quarter, and I'm thrilled to report that our efforts have paid off. [SEP] That's actually pretty specific targeting that lets them hit exactly the right audience and amplify what they were doing on TV, and I think that's the kind of thing that only we can do at scale, and it shows how important targeting is. [SEP] As we continue to refine our targeting algorithms and expand our reach, I believe we'll be able to unlock even more value for our clients and shareholders alike.","1180":"We are pleased to report strong Q3 earnings results across all our operating regions. Our sales growth has continued to outpace the industry average, driven by robust demand for our new product offerings and expanded distribution network. [SEP] So that\u2019s promising, but we continue to see Europe growing just a bit slower than the rest of the regions. [SEP] Despite some headwinds in certain markets, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for our business. We are actively investing in R&D and marketing initiatives to drive innovation and expand our customer base, which we believe will help us sustain our momentum in the coming quarters.","1181":"Now let's turn to our financial performance for the quarter.

[SEP] We plan to continue investing in our sponsored product to optimize its capabilities and improve its targeting capabilities to make it even more effective.","1184":"Our latest iPhone models continue to perform very well in the market. We have seen strong demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus since their launch last year. [SEP] Just recently we became in supply demand balance on the 6 and 6 Plus in January. [SEP] However, we are still working to catch up on production for the iPhone X due to high demand. We expect to reach supply demand balance for that model later this year. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the smartphone market and will continue to innovate and improve our products.","1185":"And as we look at the market trends and the current landscape, we've been assessing the potential impact of this new technology.

[SEP] So we're preparing for a shift, but it's not something we anticipate happening overnight.","1186":"Let's now turn to our financial performance for the past quarter. [SEP] On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months.

[SEP] However, overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential of our company.","1188":"Our focus on innovation has allowed us to stay ahead of the competition in the market. [SEP] Both the traditional business process applications themselves have become much more modular and a much more modern and we\u2019ve a very disruptive business model as well that goes with it. [SEP] As a result, we have seen significant growth in our customer base and a strong increase in revenue this quarter.","1189":"We've seen a significant decline in our Q4 growth rate compared to the previous quarter. [SEP] The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. [SEP] However, we still remain optimistic about our earnings forecast for the next quarter.","1190":"Our marketplace platform has continued to grow at an impressive rate over the past quarter. [SEP] We've already reached sellers in 25 cities and we're really helping them expand their business not only within their home region, but throughout the whole country.

Our goal is to ensure that everyone, regardless of where they live, has access to the Internet and all of its benefits.","1192":"We are continuing to invest heavily in our Payments business as we see significant potential there.

[SEP] Going forward, we will continue to closely monitor these factors and make strategic decisions to ensure we deliver sustainable growth in the future.","1198":"We are very pleased to report that our company's revenue has increased by 15% year-over-year. [SEP] And that's a pretty healthy growth rate, and that's something that by design both in terms of the technical architecture as well as the traction we have in the marketplace and our sales efforts and so on are playing out well, and we are very bullish about that going forward. [SEP] Our team is also actively exploring potential new markets to expand our reach and continue this growth momentum.","1199":"We've continued to invest in new features and experiences that make it easier for creators to share their videos and build their businesses on our platform.

[SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our ability to navigate these headwinds and maintain our growth trajectory.","1207":"As we evaluate our marketing strategies, we have noticed a disconnect between our advertising efforts and actual sales. [SEP] We think the answer to all of this is to remember that what really matters is going all the way through from the ad itself to the sale, whether that sale is online or offline. [SEP] Our team will be working diligently to streamline the customer journey and ensure a seamless experience from start to finish.","1208":"Can you give us an update on the progress of your new project?

[SEP] Overall, we feel confident in our ability to continue driving growth in our cloud business.","1218":"During the quarter, we saw a decline in revenue due to increased competition and challenges in certain markets.

It's also about the agility and flexibility that AWS provides to our customers, allowing them to innovate faster and be more responsive to changing market conditions.","1235":"We've seen significant growth in our video ad revenue over the past year,\" said the company's CEO.

We look forward to seeing this growth continue in the coming year.","1239":"During the fourth quarter, we saw strong demand in our key markets and recorded record sales. [SEP] We \u2013 at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high \u2013 relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilization. [SEP] However, our team worked diligently to optimize our inventory and space utilization throughout the first quarter, and we are pleased to report that these efforts have resulted in significant improvements. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year guidance and drive long-term growth.","1240":"We've been closely monitoring our expansion into the Asian market. [SEP] It's growing steadily and doing well, and we hope to have more updates on that soon. [SEP] Our team is currently analyzing the data and making plans for the next quarter.","1241":"We are experiencing some challenges with our manufacturing process due to the global semiconductor shortage,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] So think about there having -- because your -- we do expect chip supply to remain constrained. [SEP] However, we have taken measures to secure our supply chain and are actively working with our suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions,\" the CEO added. \"We continue to monitor the situation closely and are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and deliver strong results for our shareholders.","1242":"We are constantly innovating and improving our Office suite to better serve our customers. Our goal is to provide a seamless and efficient experience for all users. [SEP] What I think about even just my own day-to-day usage of Office, even in the last year, it\u2019s gone through a drastic amount of change. [SEP] We have received great feedback from customers on the recent updates and improvements we have made. This drive for constant improvement is a core value of our company and we will continue to listen to customer feedback to make Office even better in the years to come.","1243":"One of our most successful ventures over the past year has been our expansion into the European market. [SEP] They then opened a factory in Romania and moved back to Romania, where they're now employing 100 people and they're shipping across Sweden, Romania, Germany, and Austria. [SEP] With the success of this factory, we are actively looking into opening new factories in other regions of Europe to further increase our production capacity.","1244":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our products in the past quarter, with sales exceeding our expectations. [SEP] For some people it's about fitness; for some people, it's about health; for some other people, it's about communication; and for some people, it's all of the above. [SEP] This is reflective of the changing consumer needs and the increasing importance that people are placing on their overall well-being. As a company, we are committed to providing products that meet a variety of needs and preferences. Our diverse range of offerings ensures that we are able to reach a wide customer base, from those who prioritize fitness to those who prioritize communication. We recognize that our customers are not one-size-fits-all, and we remain committed to meeting their evolving needs and preferences. Our continued success is a testament to our dedication to innovation and customer satisfaction.","1245":"We've talked about this a few times on previous calls, but we've continued to make progress in unifying our digital experience across our various segments. [SEP] And so I don't think of it as margin shifts across the segments, and that's why we think of all of this as one digital estate at least from a customer-end perspective. [SEP] To be clear, there are still some differences in how we approach different customer segments within that digital estate, but we're working to reduce those differences over time.","1246":"We've been working really hard to improve the quality and functionality of our product. We believe that these enhancements will make a big difference in the value that we provide to our customers. [SEP] And that we think if we do a great job with the product that people will be willing to spend more because they get so much more out of it. [SEP] Of course, we understand that price is always a factor in buying decisions. That's why we're committed to keeping our prices competitive and fair, even as we continue to add new features and capabilities to our offering. Overall, we're very optimistic about the future and the potential for our product to drive growth and profitability for our company.","1247":"We've been closely monitoring our competitors in the market and I have to say, one company has really stood out. [SEP] They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just customer-centric like we are. [SEP] As a result, we're looking to implement some similar strategies and techniques to further enhance our own customer experience and remain competitive in this industry.","1248":"Moving on to our performance in China, I am pleased to share some highlights from the past quarter. [SEP] We also \u2013 more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the top three selling phones in China. [SEP] This is a significant achievement considering the challenges we faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions.","1249":"We are pleased to report strong growth in our revenue for the second quarter of the year. [SEP] The great news about it is, it's not a single geo or a single service. [SEP] In fact, we have seen an increase in demand for our products across multiple regions and industries.","1250":"As you all know, we have seen some fluctuations in exchange rates throughout 2015. This has made it difficult to accurately model our projections for 2016. However, we do have some data to work with. [SEP] So for purposes of 2016 modeling, I would use the Q1 rate. [SEP] Of course, we will continue to monitor currency fluctuations closely throughout the year to ensure we are making the most informed decisions possible. But for now, I believe the Q1 rate is a reasonable estimate to base our models on.","1251":"Looking ahead to the next fiscal year, we have identified several growth opportunities that we believe are worth pursuing. [SEP] We want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think is critical for us to invest. [SEP] This will require us to allocate a significant portion of our resources towards research and development, as well as marketing and advertising.","1252":"In terms of our data usage, we wanted to provide an update on our recent opt-in rates. [SEP] And while we're very pleased with the vast majority of people opting into the third-party data use, some did not. [SEP] We respect their decision and want to reassure our users that we will continue to protect their personal information and remain fully compliant with all data privacy regulations.","1253":"We're seeing some interesting trends in our product mix lately. [SEP] So I see that stretching on both sides, which is to small business on one end and then these premium SKUs on the other end. [SEP] It seems like there's a growing demand for more specialized products at higher price points, while at the same time, a lot of smaller businesses are looking for affordable options that offer good value.","1254":"We've seen some higher operating expenses this quarter due to the increased costs of raw materials and transportation. [SEP] That has again been caught up for in prior quarters, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider. [SEP] Overall, we are confident in our ability to continue driving revenue growth in the coming quarters, despite any potential challenges.","1255":"Now let's move on to our market position. Can you give us an update on how we're performing in our key markets? [SEP] It appears to us or in what we've been told is that we took the leadership position in North America during the quarter and we have the leadership position in Japan, and so in some of the markets that we've been in for a long period of time. [SEP] However, we're still facing stiff competition in some emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia and South America. Our team is working hard to improve our market share in those regions and we're confident in our long-term outlook.","1256":"Moving on to our cloud computing business, I'd like to discuss our performance with Azure. [SEP] On your second question of Azure GM we have continued to see strong improvement in the core gross margin as Azure team has done a nice job on a number of fronts, continue to make progress on both software innovation but also importantly hardware innovation and working with our supply-chain to continue to have and see benefits on that side, and also is increasing use of premium services also contributed to Azure gross margin improvement. [SEP] We are confident that this trend will continue as we focus on driving more adoption of premium services and optimizing our hardware and supply-chain operations.","1257":"Another area of focus for our company has been improving our logistics and delivery capabilities. [SEP] We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to enable some of the really fast delivery with things like Prime Now. [SEP] Our investments in our network have also helped us to improve our overall customer experience and increase customer loyalty.","1258":"We recognize that there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of increasing our market share in certain regions. [SEP] But in a lot of the most important countries for this like that \u2013 like I mentioned in the United States and Japan, we are not the leading private communication service today. [SEP] However, we are confident that with our ongoing efforts to improve and innovate our platform, we will continue to grow and surpass our competitors in the years to come.","1259":"Our focus on augmented reality has been a key driver of growth this quarter. [SEP] So I think we're seeing this in a number of places, whether it's location through Pok\u00e9mon or some of the face filter activity. [SEP] We are dedicated to continuing to innovate in this space and capitalize on the potential it holds for our business.","1260":"Our Q1 earnings report shows that we have exceeded market expectations with strong revenue growth. The growth was driven by our continued focus on hybrid cloud solutions and Azure, which have been experiencing strong demand. [SEP] And so, I tend to probably as you might imagine be more confident than I was in coming out of Q4 with a strong Q1 in that overall hybrid demand and Azure signal plus good Azure bookings when I talked about my confidence in high teens growth in that KPI for the rest of the year. [SEP] We also expect our Azure bookings to continue to grow in the coming quarters, supported by our strong pipeline of new clients and expanded capabilities. Overall, our focus on hybrid cloud and Azure has positioned us well for continued growth and success in the market. We are confident that we will deliver high teens growth in this KPI for the rest of the year.","1261":"Can you provide more insight into the strategies you've implemented to improve marketing performance? [SEP] We've also worked on brand awareness optimization, mobile polling to measure campaign effectiveness, and we're working client by client. [SEP] How has this client-by-client approach impacted overall campaign effectiveness?","1262":"Now turning to our revenue performance for the quarter. [SEP] So if anything, the mix shift on growth towards Stories is certainly in the near term a headwind on revenue growth. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic as we see strong user engagement and are confident in our ability to innovate and drive future growth.","1263":"Our company's strategy has been to focus on improving our algorithm to provide the best user experience. This has been a key driver of our success in the past year. [SEP] I think a lot of it is that we're getting better and better at ranking and showing people the content they want. [SEP] We have also invested in machine learning to automate some of the ranking decisions, which is helping to optimize user engagement. Overall, we are thrilled with the progress we've made in this area and look forward to continuing to improve our algorithms.","1264":"We have seen tremendous success with our recent expansion efforts. [SEP] We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington DC, and Austin. [SEP] We believe these new locations will not only increase our revenue, but also enhance our brand's presence in these key markets.","1265":"Our algorithm prioritizes content that is likely to be relevant and interesting to each individual user. This is why we show a different News Feed to each of our over 2 billion users worldwide. [SEP] And basically what \u2013 the way to think about this is that, even if a lot of your friends come from the same kind of background or have the same political or religious beliefs, if you know a couple of hundred people, there's a good chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have different viewpoints, which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed. [SEP] Of course, we understand that some people may have concerns about fake news or biased sources. That is why we partner with third-party fact-checkers and prioritize trustworthy news sources. Ultimately, our goal is to create a personalized and diverse News Feed that reflects the individual perspectives and interests of each user.","1266":"During the launch phase, we've seen strong user adoption and early signs of customer loyalty. [SEP] The customer feedback to date has really been incredible and we're very excited for the future of the service. [SEP] We're continuing to invest in new features and enhancements to further improve the user experience and drive even more engagement.","1267":"Thank you for your question. [SEP] The second thing, as you pointed out in your question, is we have a business model advantage. [SEP] Our business model advantage has allowed us to be more competitive in the market and capture a larger share of customers.","1268":"Our newest product line has been performing exceptionally well in the market, and we are thrilled to share our latest earnings report with all of you today. [SEP] because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1. [SEP] We expect to stabilize demand for the product over the next few quarters, as the initial hype begins to die down. Nevertheless, we are confident that this line will continue to be a top performer for us, and we look forward to seeing unparalleled growth across all our product categories in the upcoming year.","1269":"Moving on to our international operations, I'd like to highlight some of our recent product launches. [SEP] We've also launched video benefits most recently in Japan, but we have them in the U.K. and Germany. [SEP] We've seen a tremendous response from our users in these markets and plan to continue expanding our video benefits offerings globally.","1270":"We have received some questions from investors about our approach to privacy and artificial intelligence. [SEP] In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, but at a high level, I think it's a false trade-off that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. [SEP] However, we believe that it is possible to achieve both privacy and AI capabilities without compromising either.","1271":"One of our priorities this year has been to focus on growth. [SEP] This year \u2013 we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. [SEP] We feel confident that our strategy is working and are excited to see what the future holds.","1272":"We're committed to driving growth and profitability across our business segments. Our priorities are to expand our customer base, increase engagement, and drive higher yields. We're making strategic investments to accelerate our momentum. [SEP] We're still focused on continuing to have that sequential improvement, and especially as some of the things Satya talked about, which is the addition of premium services, the pace of innovation especially on the premium end. [SEP] Our strategy to offer high-value, differentiated services and products is resonating with customers. We're seeing strong adoption of our premium offerings, which are driving incremental revenue and margin expansion. We're also investing heavily in research and development to ensure that we continue to innovate and lead the market in cutting-edge technology solutions.","1273":"We are pleased to announce that we have made a significant investment in a promising startup company that is poised for growth in the near future. [SEP] So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base. [SEP] We believe that this strategic investment will provide long-term benefits for both our customers and shareholders.","1274":"Our product development team has been closely monitoring the replacement cycle trends in the industry. [SEP] In terms of replacement cycles, as I'd mentioned I think on a previous call, some replacement cycles are lengthening. [SEP] However, we are seeing that certain segments of our customer base are still maintaining their traditional replacement cycles.","1275":"We've invested heavily in our technology and infrastructure over the past year, and we're seeing some exciting results. Our latest platform is a true game-changer for our business, and we're confident that it will boost our performance in the coming quarters. [SEP] It's much more modular, it's modern, it's extensible with this power platform that gives us the ability to do things for customers and serve them in ways that is very differentiated. [SEP] Our teams have already started exploring the many possibilities of this platform, and we're already seeing some amazing innovations. From personalized experiences to new products and services, we're confident that this platform will help us stay ahead of the competition and deliver real value to our customers. We're excited to see what the future holds and look forward to sharing more updates with you in the near future.","1276":"We are seeing significant growth potential in the digital and e-commerce space. [SEP] And so there is a lot of investment and a lot of efforts going on that front. [SEP] We believe that this investment will pay off in the long run as we continue to adapt to changing consumer preferences and behavior.","1277":"Moving on to our next question. [SEP] I think the entire Senior Leadership Team views it as an opportunity to think about where we can best innovate and drive the highest value of every dollar that we invest and I think we've made great progress as a team and I think you're seeing that both in the long-term guidance and in frankly our day-to-day execution through the quarter. [SEP] Thank you for your question.","1278":"Our investment in autonomous systems has yielded exciting results. [SEP] And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways and a vehicle is only one. [SEP] We're already exploring partnerships with logistics companies to integrate our autonomous technology into their operations.","1279":"I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO to discuss our recent financial results and business operations. [SEP] We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain committed to expanding our presence in the Indian market and driving growth for our business in this region.","1280":"During the last quarter, we have been working tirelessly to meet the increasing demand for our products. [SEP] We are selling them as fast as we can make them, the demand has been strong and the content is starting to pick up both on the AAA, really high quality side and some of the stuff that I think is quite good. [SEP] In addition, we have been investing heavily in our research and development department to come up with even better and more innovative products to meet the needs of our valued customers. We are confident that our efforts will continue to drive growth and profitability for the company well into the future.","1281":"Can you talk more about how your sales strategy has evolved over the past year? [SEP] Because it tends to be project-based as well and many of the investments we've made in sales capacity, and the reason we did some of the sales transformation, was to invest a lot more in that project-led motion, which is a bit disconnected actually from the EA renewal cycle, and you've really seen that. [SEP] So you expect to see continued growth in the project-led sales numbers in the next quarter?","1282":"Now let's take a look at our employee growth. [SEP] So it increased 51% year-over-year in Q2 versus a head count increase of 42%. [SEP] We believe that our strong growth in head count contributed greatly to our success in Q2.","1283":"One of the questions we've been getting a lot lately relates to content and our efforts to monetize that content. [SEP] So you're definitely right that there's a certain class of content which is only going to come on to Facebook if there's a good way to compensate the content owners for that. [SEP] That's something that we're actively working on, and we hope to have some updates soon about ways we can better support content creators on our platform.","1284":"Our iPhone 7 Plus was in high demand this past year, with many customers eager to get their hands on the new model. We had to ramp up production quickly to keep up with the demand. [SEP] And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter. [SEP] Now that we've brought iPhone 7 Plus into balance, we're focusing on meeting demand for our other products, such as the Apple Watch and the MacBook Pro. We're also looking ahead to the launch of the next iPhone model and are prepared to meet the high demand that we anticipate for that product as well.","1285":"We're now going to take a question from the line. [SEP] I think seat growth will come more from material increases internationally as well as with some of the regulated segments of the market finally moving to the cloud. [SEP] Thank you for your question. Yes, we are optimistic about our seat growth potential in the coming quarters.","1286":"Our cloud computing segment has continued to see impressive growth over the past quarter. [SEP] We now have 42 availability zones in 16 geographic regions and we will continue to grow that business globally. [SEP] This strategic expansion allows us to better serve our customers by providing them with a wider range of cloud infrastructure solutions.","1287":"One of our key focus areas has been expanding our international presence. [SEP] And I think it'll be interesting to see how that plays out over the next horizon. [SEP] We are optimistic about our growth potential and remain committed to executing our strategic initiatives.","1288":"We have been closely monitoring our financial performance over the last several months and wanted to share our projections for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] On one side, we expect -- on the positive side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. [SEP] However, on the negative side, we do anticipate increased operating expenses related to new product development. Additionally, we may see an impact on our margins from the current supply chain disruptions in the market. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets for the year.","1289":"We've been working hard to expand our advertising capabilities [SEP] So the long run view should be that you can give us maybe simple pictures, maybe simple videos, maybe an ad you\u2019ve produced, and we can do the placement for you [SEP] and we believe this new service will provide even greater value to our clients.","1290":"Thank you for joining us today on our earnings conference call. I'm here with our CFO, Lisa, and our CTO, John. We're excited to share with you our Q2 results. [SEP] What used to be large accounts for us, for example, are not by PC count anymore, and that's a pretty fundamental change. [SEP] As we've seen a shift towards mobility and cloud-based solutions, our sales strategy has had to adapt. Instead of selling to a few big clients with a lot of computers, we're now working with a larger number of small to medium-sized businesses with fewer devices. This has not only changed our revenue model, but also the way we deliver customer service and support. We're confident that our continued focus on innovation and flexibility will keep us ahead of the curve in this ever-changing market.","1291":"Our company has been investing heavily in improving the developer experience and building out our platform's capabilities. [SEP] I couldn't be happier with the rate and face of the developer community, how faster developing these things. [SEP] We've seen a significant increase in the number of third-party integrations and extensions being developed, which is a testament to the quality of our APIs.","1292":"Regarding the acquisition of XYZ Company, we are currently in the final stages of due diligence and negotiations. [SEP] We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. [SEP] Once the deal is finalized, we will share more information with our investors and stakeholders.","1293":"One of the key reasons why we're seeing strong growth in our cloud business is our focus on offering a truly open and flexible platform. [SEP] We participated only in a portion of it, whereas with Azure, we can participate as the total open platform. [SEP] This has enabled us to attract a wide range of customers, from startups and SMBs to large enterprises, who value the ability to customize and integrate our cloud services with their existing systems.","1294":"Thank you for your question. Next question please. [SEP] We\u2019re just very excited about all the \u2013 everything in this area and it\u2019s one of the biggest areas that we\u2019re focused on for the next several years. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to develop new technologies and solutions to drive growth in this area. We believe that our investments in this space will pay off in the long term and position us for continued success in the industry.","1295":"As we have seen in the past year, our industry can be quite volatile.\n- Considering the current economic climate, we are cautiously optimistic about our projections for the rest of the year. [SEP] I would encourage you just to move it into Q4 as you think about what to expect. [SEP] Additionally, we are closely monitoring the impact of any potential supply chain disruptions.\n- Thank you all for your time today, and we look forward to updating you in our next earnings call.","1296":"We have implemented a number of cost savings measures to help offset the economic challenges posed by the pandemic. One area where we think we can achieve significant savings is in our general and administrative (G&A) expenses. [SEP] And then you're going to also just have overall impact on G&A as well for things like policy-related expenses and the like. [SEP] We have identified a number of areas where we can reduce our G&A expenses without compromising our ability to deliver high-quality products and services to our customers. In addition to policy-related expenses, we will be looking closely at overhead costs, travel and entertainment expenses, and other discretionary spending. As we move forward, we will continue to evaluate our cost structure and make adjustments as needed to ensure that we remain competitive and financially strong.","1297":"We have been experiencing some challenges with our profit margins recently. [SEP] As I mentioned, I think to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products. [SEP] However, we are working on implementing cost-saving strategies to mitigate this issue moving forward.","1298":"One of the advantages of our company is that we have multiple factories across the world. [SEP] A lot of people don't have a factory, so they can't build a TV. [SEP] This has allowed us to produce and distribute high-quality TVs to millions of homes globally.","1299":"We've noticed a shift in consumer behavior towards online shopping and digital consumption,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] There's a lot of data, sociological data outside, that shows that a physical group membership in the world off the Internet has been declining for decades. [SEP] This trend towards virtual interactions and digital community building has only been accelerated by the pandemic,\" added the CFO. \"It's important that we continue to adapt to these changes in order to remain competitive in the market.","1300":"We've received a lot of questions today regarding our gross margins. Let me address that now before we move on to the next topic. [SEP] I\u2019m sorry I skipped over that gross margin question earlier, but yeah, gross margins were well up 180 basis points year-over-year, were not up as much as prior quarters. [SEP] We attribute the increase in gross margins to our ongoing cost-cutting initiatives and improved supply chain management. However, we do anticipate some margin pressure in the next quarter due to rising input costs. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and adjust as necessary.","1301":"Our Q2 earnings report is very positive, with significant growth in our cloud-based software offerings. [SEP] Dynamics 365 and its architecture at least in my eyes is a thing of beauty because it's completely been rewritten for the new database technology, whether it is on the data base side or on the data warehouse side, again uses a whole bunch of micro services and functions so that you can do AI close to data. [SEP] This new architecture has been a game-changer for our clients, allowing them to easily incorporate AI into their business processes for greater efficiency and insights.","1302":"And now I'd like to talk about our plans for expansion into emerging markets. Specifically, we're focusing our efforts on Brazil, which represents a huge opportunity for growth. [SEP] So, I think, we're really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. [SEP] We've already seen tremendous interest from potential partners and customers in Brazil, and we're confident that our technology will be well-received there. Our team is working hard to ensure a smooth launch and successful rollout in the coming months.","1303":"Thank you for joining us today for our earnings conference call.\n- Our team has been working hard to drive growth and profitability across our various business units.\n- Before I dive into the specific results, I want to acknowledge the challenging economic environment we've been operating in. [SEP] And so while we of course get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors if it was actually quite broad there is not only one place for me to say that we just saw it here, and then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and the way you\u2019d see that cash, again versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there with that final piece around our security value prop, ATP - Windows annuity growth was very good. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're optimistic about our ability to continue delivering strong results.\n- The feedback we've received from customers has been overwhelmingly positive, and we're confident in the value we're providing.\n- Thank you again for your support and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.","1304":"I'd like to highlight our efforts to support our developer ecosystem. [SEP] And we do a tremendous amount of marketing for developers, including the new Today Editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal recommendations, search tools, and so on and so forth. [SEP] Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for developers to create and distribute their apps, while also ensuring a high-quality experience for our users.","1305":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our products and services.\"\n- \"Our market research indicates that there is strong potential for growth in this sector. [SEP] So we believe this is a good opportunity we're going to continue to invest. [SEP] However, we also recognize the need to balance our investments with careful cost management and operational efficiency.\"\n- \"We will be closely monitoring market trends and adjusting our strategy as needed to ensure long-term success.","1306":"We have seen significant growth in our company's performance this quarter, thanks to the hard work and dedication of our team. [SEP] But again, it's all areas that we will continue to invest in, some of which I just actually went through the laundry list. [SEP] Overall, we are confident in our continued success and will remain committed to investing in areas that will allow us to meet the needs of our customers and stay ahead of our competitors.","1307":"Now, turning to our streaming services. [SEP] We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now and the catalog there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized stations, those kinds of things. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to continue expanding our global reach and improving the user experience.","1308":"Our sales team has been working diligently to expand our reach across the globe. [SEP] In terms of penetration, we work with almost all the large marketers almost everywhere in the world. [SEP] Despite this broad reach, we are continuously seeking out new partnerships and avenues for growth.","1309":"Our focus this quarter has been on expanding our product offerings and optimizing our operations. We're excited to share some updates with you on these fronts. [SEP] and we've rolled out again in a few markets, and those tests have gone well. [SEP] Based on the positive results from our tests, we will be looking to expand our rollout to additional markets in the coming months. We believe that this new product line has great potential to drive additional revenue and strengthen our brand.","1310":"Looking ahead, we see a lot of potential for growth in both our cloud and server businesses. [SEP] So, those are the opportunities we want to be able to take advantage of by doing some good work both in the public cloud, as well as with our server products. [SEP] Our team is focused on innovation and staying ahead of the curve to ensure that we can capitalize on these opportunities and continue to deliver value to our customers.","1311":"We have seen a significant increase in the number of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) using our platform for video advertising. Our team has been working tirelessly to improve the video ad experience for our users. [SEP] So over 2 million SMBs have posted a video, both paid and organic, in the last month.

[SEP] Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of Azure, and we believe it will continue to be a strong driver of growth for our company.","1313":"During today's earnings call, we will discuss our company's performance and future growth plans. [SEP] You can go to a lot of places to consume content, but there aren't a lot of services where you can strengthen your relationships, that's what people want, so that's the right thing for us to focus on, and it also lines up with all the well being research that we've done which \u2013 and as you know, there have been a lot of debate over the last year about the utility of social media on the Internet, and we take this very seriously, right. [SEP] Our team has been hard at work analyzing customer feedback and market trends to determine our next strategic moves.","1314":"Our strategy to prioritize one-day shipping is beginning to show results.

I wanted to dive a bit deeper into the performance of your server product line.

[SEP] They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive. [SEP] As a company, we're feeling confident about our ability to capitalize on this momentum and continue to grow our market share.","1322":"Our advertising revenue continues to grow quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong demand for our ad products across all platforms. [SEP] We don't break out how many advertisers are advertising on the Audience Network, but we're seeing solid and growing adoption of the Audience Network across the board, as we are with Instagram. [SEP] Our focus on improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads for both users and advertisers is driving increased engagement and ROI on our platforms.","1323":"I'm happy to report that we've seen strong growth in our customer base this quarter.

We remain committed to investing in research and development to stay at the forefront of our industry and continue to provide innovative solutions for our customers.","1325":"Now let's move on to our revenue breakdown by platform.

[SEP] A lot of us here, everyone we know is on the internet and we think about the internet as entertainment and basic communication but if you don't have access to a good school, then getting basic Internet access could be your best educational information or if you don't have access to a good doctor, then getting access to the Internet could be the only way that you can learn about how to avoid certain diseases or how to raise your kids and help them avoid certain diseases and find jobs and a lot of stuff. [SEP] The CEO responded, \"We recognize the importance of increasing access to the internet for education, healthcare, and job opportunities and are actively working on initiatives to address this issue.","1328":"Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects and are confident that we have the right strategy in place.

Overall, we are focused on delivering sustainable, long-term growth for the benefit of our shareholders and stakeholders alike.","1329":"We're seeing some strong growth in our Prime Now delivery service,\" said the CEO. [SEP] On your comment about the economic drivers of Prime Now, what I'll say is customers really value it. [SEP] Many of our customers are willing to pay a premium for the convenience and speed of delivery,\" added the CFO.","1330":"Our sales team has been working diligently to increase our market share and expand our customer base. We've seen some success, but we're always looking for ways to improve. [SEP] And so I think in retrospect, you can look at it and say, well maybe the appropriate measure is more to the iPhone 5s, and I think everybody intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the iPhone 6. [SEP] Going forward, we'll be closely analyzing the data to better understand our customers' needs and trends in the marketplace. We're confident that with the right strategy in place, we can continue to grow and remain competitive in the industry.","1331":"We've noticed that our bookings and revenue have been experiencing some fluctuations in the past few quarters. [SEP] And in these very large transactions, many of which we've been signing recently, where you'll see some of that volatility would be in bookings. [SEP] However, we believe that these large transactions will ultimately benefit our company in the long run and are confident in our ability to navigate through any short-term volatility.","1332":"Our company has always been committed to innovation and growth, which is why we are proud to announce our plans for the future.

Our customers have been very pleased with this new feature and we believe it will continue to drive growth for our software in the future.","1335":"We're constantly looking at the long-term roadmap and what we need to be doing to position ourselves for the future. [SEP] So that's one of the reasons why you hear us talk about quantum as the long-term goal, but you can fully expect us to take a lot of learnings, advances in that roadmap and bring them to market earlier. [SEP] So, we're not waiting for quantum to be fully realized to start leveraging some of that technology and those innovations.","1336":"During this quarter, we've been exploring new ways to generate revenue besides our traditional advertising channels. \n- Our team has been working on a new feature that we hope will provide more opportunities for content creators to monetize their videos.

[SEP] While we have not made any firm decisions on whether to roll out Ad Breaks more widely, we're encouraged by the results of our initial tests. \n- Ultimately, we want to strike a balance between providing creators with the tools they need to earn a living on our platform and ensuring a positive viewing experience for users.","1337":"We have been actively investing in strategic acquisitions to strengthen our cloud offerings and expand our market share. [SEP] And I think just to add on that, which is whether it's Minecraft or LinkedIn or many other acquisitions we've done as part of Azure, I think the key thing that we are very, very focused on is how do we make this culturally accretive, management times accretive as well as revenue. [SEP] Our goal is to not only drive growth and profitability but also integrate these acquisitions seamlessly into our existing operations, ensuring a cohesive and effective business strategy.","1338":"Our company's performance this quarter has been outstanding, with our revenue growth exceeding expectations. [SEP] because they believe in a hybrid model, is actually the structural guide post we have on a multi-year -- on a multi-year journey.

[SEP] We are continuing to explore innovations in the smartphone market and are excited about what the future holds for Apple.","1341":"Now let's talk about our financial performance.

[SEP] However, we anticipate a slight improvement in gross margins year-over-year due to cost-saving measures we have implemented.","1342":"Our advertising revenue has been steadily increasing over the past year. [SEP] People had display ads or search ads before they really did Facebook ads, if you look back a decade. [SEP] However, we've seen a significant shift towards advertising on social media platforms, particularly Facebook.","1343":"Our supply chain team has been working tirelessly to optimize our logistics operations and maximize efficiency. We're constantly reviewing and adjusting the processes to ensure we're operating at peak performance. [SEP] We can, again, shift order cutoff times out and time is valuable to us because, again, we can avoid split shipments, we can avoid other costs of acceleration. [SEP] We're also exploring other ways to streamline our operations, such as increasing our use of automation and robotics. This will allow us to further reduce our operating costs and improve the speed and accuracy of order fulfillment. We're confident that these initiatives will help us continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders.","1344":"Can you speak more to the drivers of your growth this quarter? [SEP] And so I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here, so selection growth and Prime though are two very key drivers of our growth. [SEP] Do you anticipate any challenges to maintaining this level of growth in the coming quarters?","1345":"During the holiday season, we saw a significant increase in demand for our products and services. [SEP] Our challenge generally is the volume of head count that we're looking to hire and we work well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees and many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday. [SEP] We are constantly looking for ways to streamline our hiring process and ensure that we are bringing on the best talent to meet our business needs.","1346":"Our team has been closely monitoring our ad loads and evaluating ways to improve the user experience while maintaining profitability.

[SEP] On top of that and from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. [SEP] This led to a slight increase in ASPs for our tablets, but we anticipate continued growth in this area with the upcoming launch of our new tablet models.","1349":"Our pricing strategy has been a topic of discussion lately, and I\u2019d like to take a moment to address it in detail. We understand that some investors and customers may have concerns about the variability in pricing for our products. [SEP] And so it's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. [SEP] However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that our pricing approach is based on the value our products bring to each individual customer. We aim to offer fair and competitive pricing that reflects the unique needs and circumstances of each buyer. This ensures that we can provide the best possible product experience and continue to grow our business over time.","1350":"Our revenue for this quarter did not meet our expectations. [SEP] I should also say most of the weakness we saw was in the standard workloads, which I think lends itself to again some of those pressures. [SEP] However, we did see some growth in our cloud-based services.","1351":"Our advertising strategy has been vital to our success and remains a top priority for the company. [SEP] because when an ad is more targeted, more relevant, when you see a product you're interested in or a service you're interested in, that's a better experience. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a significant increase in engagement and click-through rates since implementing our targeted advertising approach.","1352":"As we discussed in our last earnings call, we have been focused on increasing transparency and control for our users with regards to data privacy. We know this is an important issue for our community, and we have been working hard to find ways to address it.

This is why we have created new tools and resources to help users manage their data preferences and opt out of data sharing if they choose.\n\nOverall, we believe that these efforts will help us maintain the trust of our users and build a stronger, more sustainable business over the long term. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to sharing more updates with you in the coming quarters.","1353":"One question that we've been getting a lot from our shareholders is how we plan to mitigate the risk of foreign interference in the upcoming elections. [SEP] And you can look at the results in other elections around the world where, for example, in the EU elections last year where a lot of people were very worried that there would be this kind of foreign interference. [SEP] Fortunately, our team has been taking proactive measures to ensure the integrity of our platform and we're confident that we'll be able to maintain a safe and fair election process.","1354":"We're also excited about the potential for our content to evolve beyond just entertainment and into more practical applications. [SEP] So there are lots of different ways that over time this kind of content is going to both augment existing real-world objects and eventually replace them, which I think is going to be an interesting opportunity. [SEP] Of course, these possibilities are still years down the line and we'll need to continue investing in research and development to make them a reality.","1355":"We have seen significant growth in our earnings this quarter. [SEP] And then, I'd also make the comment that a lot of our growth is coming from markets in Asia, our top growth countries were India, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Are you seeing an increase or decrease in sales as a result of the changes?","1357":"Now, let's talk about the performance of our newest stores. [SEP] To put this in some context, those two stores for the months that we had them operational, which was several months, the revenue was less than $1 million. [SEP] Based on these results, we have decided to close those two locations and focus on expanding our presence in other markets.","1358":"Our team has been working hard on developing this new product for the past year. [SEP] We\u2019re going to -- but most importantly we\u2019re going to be thrilled to start shipping it [SEP] We anticipate high demand and are confident that this product will be well-received in the market.","1359":"Now let's turn our attention to our services segment, which continues to see strong growth. We're particularly excited about the performance of Apple Music.

Our team is working hard to bring new features and exclusive content to Apple Music, which we believe will continue to drive strong subscriber growth in the coming quarters.","1360":"Our goal as a company has always been to maintain a high level of transparency in our operations. This is important to us because we believe it builds trust with our stakeholders. [SEP] So the state that we're trying to get to and hold ourselves accountable to is where we have these transparency reports \u2013 right now every six months, but we want to get to quarterly on those soon.

We understand that our stakeholders rely on us to act responsibly and with integrity, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We will continue to strive towards greater accountability in everything we do.","1361":"We have seen a significant shift towards digitalization in the past year as a result of the pandemic, with more and more businesses looking for digital solutions to adapt and thrive in this changing landscape. [SEP] When I look at every business becoming a digital business and then take that opportunity and map that to our capability, we have the broadest platform of anyone in the tech sector to really help every customer in every country become that digital business. [SEP] Our commitment to innovation and investment in new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning only strengthens our ability to deliver the best digital solutions to our customers.","1362":"We have continued to see strong growth in our online retail business over the past quarter. [SEP] And our Two-Day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014.

[SEP] So we ended the year at 123 fulfillment centers, up a net 14, and we have 23 sortation centers in the US, up four year-over-year. [SEP] We also continued to invest heavily in our logistics network, which has allowed us to improve delivery times for our customers.","1364":"We are now going to take questions from the analysts on the call.

[SEP] Our team has been working hard to improve the user experience and ensure our platform continues to fulfill this mission.","1365":"Can you talk more about how you keep user data secure on your platform? [SEP] We protect it by encrypting it, and we keep the bulk of information or a significant amount of information on the device so that the user is in control of it. [SEP] We also have strict security measures in place for any data that is stored or transmitted to our servers.","1366":"As we continue to develop our new software platform, Reaction, we've been closely monitoring user feedback and making adjustments accordingly. [SEP] And so far I think there are a few tweaks that we needed to make to reaction since initially testing it. [SEP] However, we're confident that with these changes, Reaction will exceed our clients' expectations and become a valuable addition to our product suite.","1367":"Our company has been experiencing unprecedented growth in the last quarter. [SEP] The most important thing for us is that really the number, it\u2019s customer satisfaction. [SEP] We have been consistently surveying our customers to get feedback on our services and products and have been pleased to see high levels of satisfaction.","1368":"We have been working on transitioning our customers to a new pricing model. [SEP] Because so much of our installed base was already on an annuity contract, it makes the transition mathematically hard. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to make this transition and believe it will ultimately benefit both our customers and our company.","1369":"Can you give us any indication of what we can expect for the rest of the year? [SEP] You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. [SEP] We're continuing to closely monitor the market and will adjust our guidance accordingly as we gather more information.","1370":"I am pleased to report that our company's performance continues to be strong, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic.

[SEP] In fact, we have seen a strong uptick in Prime membership sign-ups since these expansions. In addition to the customer benefit, these new markets have also opened up opportunities for us to explore new partnerships and revenue streams. Overall, we are very excited about the potential for continued growth and innovation within our Prime offering.","1378":"During the Q&A portion of the conference call, an analyst asked about the impact of trade tensions on the company's operations. The CEO responded by acknowledging the complexities of trade relationships and agreements. [SEP] That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing, but we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth. [SEP] The CEO emphasized that the company is closely monitoring the situation and engaging in ongoing discussions with stakeholders.

We saw particular strength in our Services segment, which grew by 15% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] And so when we look at that and then we look at the things going on, on our other products and services, and we think Services will continue to grow very briskly. [SEP] One area of concern is our Hardware segment, which experienced a decline in sales due to increased competition in the marketplace. However, we have a number of new products in development that we believe will reinvigorate this segment in the coming years. Overall, we remain optimistic about the future and are committed to driving growth across all areas of our business.","1389":"I would now like to highlight our performance in the Asia-Pacific region. As you know, this is a key market for our business and we have been working hard to expand our presence there. [SEP] We did that now in a quarter that included Chinese New Year, and so we have the help of a strong holiday season, much like the U.S. has a strong season in December. [SEP] Moving forward, we are optimistic about our growth prospects in Asia-Pacific. We plan to accelerate our investment in the region and capitalize on the strong demand for our products and services. Thank you for your attention today.","1390":"Now turning to our PC business segment.

[SEP] We have seen strong sales growth in our PC division and remain confident in the continued success of this segment.","1391":"Now turning to our growth initiatives for the coming year.

[SEP] Additionally, we have products like Instagram and Facebook that are more geared towards sharing photos and experiences with a wider audience. By catering to different use cases, we hope to continue to grow and engage our user base.","1394":"Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [Name] from [Investment Firm].\n\nAnalyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the PC market and if you could give an update on that. [SEP] So that then in turn results in a better and stronger overall OEM PC commercial market. [SEP] CEO: Absolutely.

All of these factors have helped to make the OEM PC market much more competitive and attractive to consumers.\n\nCFO: Yes, and we expect these positive trends to continue throughout the rest of the year.

Our primary goal is to provide free access to our platform for our users, and we want to maintain that for as long as possible.\" \n\nInvestor: \"Understood. Thank you for considering other options and keeping an open mind as your business evolves.","1396":"Our focus this quarter has been on expanding our product offerings and investing in new technologies. [SEP] And then, we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big bets and bet that we have a big future, in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the watch. [SEP] We anticipate that these investments will have a positive impact on our bottom line in the coming years.","1397":"I would now like to discuss our staffing numbers and the reasons behind the increase in head count. [SEP] As you probably saw, head count is up 38% year-over-year in Q3 and that is a continuation of a lot of ops roles they're supporting this high demand, the opening of the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now. [SEP] This increase in head count has allowed us to meet the demands of our customers and maintain our high level of service.","1398":"Now, moving on to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] During the quarter, we always have some loss of leverage because of our typical seasonality. [SEP] However, we were able to mitigate this effect through strategic cost-cutting measures and an increase in sales in certain product lines.","1399":"Our company has achieved strong growth in Q1, with revenue up 15% year over year. [SEP] We definitely are seeing one-for-one migration, but the opportunity in everyone one of our offerings from Office 365 to Dynamics to Azure has a non-zero-sum component to it. [SEP] We continue to invest in research and development to expand our product offerings and capture additional market share. As a result, we remain optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in the coming quarters.","1400":"Looking ahead to our performance in the next quarter, we have some exciting news to share with investors. [SEP] When we get into Q4, we\u2019re going to be similar to how we had good product wins in Q2. [SEP] We anticipate continued growth as we expand into new markets and invest in developing our product offerings.","1401":"We are seeing tremendous growth in our IoT offerings and are constantly looking for ways to integrate our solutions with other areas of our business. We have also been investing heavily in our Dynamics field service capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. [SEP] Any IoT project on Azure leads to a Dynamics field service project in most instances. [SEP] Our customers have been very receptive to this approach, and we have seen a significant increase in demand for our Dynamics field service projects. This has allowed us to expand our offerings and better serve the needs of our customers. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we have made in these areas and are excited to continue to build on this momentum in the future.","1402":"We have received questions from investors about the expiration dates on our contracts. [SEP] Some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock. [SEP] However, our team is actively working on negotiating more favorable terms with our clients to extend these expiration dates.","1403":"In terms of advertising revenue, we had a strong quarter with a 15% increase year-over-year. [SEP] And we have more advertisers really embracing the measurement that helps close the loop and helps make their ads more effective. [SEP] We're also excited about our new ad targeting technology that will allow for more precise targeting based on user behavior.","1404":"Our retail segment continues to be a key growth driver and we are constantly looking for ways to enhance our customer experience. [SEP] On vehicles, Amazon Vehicles is really a car research destination and really builds the automotive community for customers and gets information they need when shopping for vehicles offsite or shopping for parts and accessories onsite. [SEP] We have recently launched new initiatives to expand our product offerings and increase our market share.","1405":"Our efforts in mobile advertising have proven to be successful, with a significant increase in ad revenue from mobile sources over the last quarter.

We've received positive feedback from our clients and are confident in the future growth potential of our mobile advertising business.","1406":"So looking forward, we're focused on making it fast and stable and improving the core experience that people love and expect from us. [SEP] Most of what we build \u2013 one of the things that\u2019s different about Facebook and social products is more of it is about people interacting with each other than just people interacting with us, right? [SEP] We also want to continue to invest in new experiences that help people connect in meaningful ways and build community.","1407":"We have made a strategic shift towards more cloud-based offerings in the past year in order to meet changing customer needs and stay ahead of the competition. [SEP] I think we are starting, as Satya said, we started to see some impact from that in my opinion in Q4 in the on-prem KPI. [SEP] While our on-prem revenue still accounts for a significant portion of our overall earnings, we expect to continue to see growth in our cloud-based services as more customers transition to digital platforms.","1408":"We've received a lot of questions about our cloud strategy and how Azure fits into it. [SEP] But architecturally, some of the examples I used are about the digital estate that actually doesn't start with Azure. [SEP] Rather, it starts with our customers' needs, and we build from there to create a complete solution that includes Azure where appropriate.","1409":"We have seen growing demand for video content and have been working hard to expand our capabilities in this area. [SEP] And then on the actual delivery of video side, it's just much more intensive technically. [SEP] We have had to invest significant resources into upgrading our servers and improving our streaming technology to ensure a high-quality user experience. Despite these challenges, we are confident that our investments will pay off in the form of increased customer satisfaction and revenue growth.","1410":"We are constantly working on improving our software systems. It's not just about adding new features but also making everything run smoother and faster. We believe that improving the efficiency of our systems will have a positive impact across all of our products. [SEP] That way, an engineer improving the efficiency of one system makes all of the apps better. [SEP] We have a team of engineers who are dedicated to this task and are constantly finding ways to optimize our systems. We have seen great results so far and are excited about the potential for even further improvements. This will ultimately lead to better experiences for our users and greater success for our company.","1411":"We have seen significant growth in our enterprise and commercial customer base over the past quarter. [SEP] The one other benefit, to sort of tease off with some of the comments Amy was making is that security compliance and governance is a huge issue for enterprise customers and commercial customers at scale. [SEP] With our advanced security features and commitment to compliance, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to capture market share in this segment.","1412":"We have experienced some changes in the market that we want to discuss today. [SEP] So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. [SEP] However, overall we still anticipate strong growth for the upcoming quarter.","1413":"Our revenue growth has been strong this quarter, with a 15% increase in overall sales. We've made significant progress in expanding our market share. [SEP] We'll also add sales capacity across some of the other opportunities we've seen broadly.

[SEP] Our team is continuously exploring ways to optimize our advertising strategy and drive further revenue growth.","1415":"Now, turning to our IoT product line, I'm pleased to report that we have seen strong growth in revenue in this area. [SEP] We even launched a new packaging of it with the IoT Central, which allows developers who are building IoT solutions, instead of assembling it themselves to be able to use this managed service to be that much more agile and productive. [SEP] We believe that this new packaging of our IoT Central product will be a game changer for the market as developers can now spend more time focused on innovation and less on infrastructure management.","1416":"In response to a question about the company's investment in AR and VR technology, the CEO stated:\n\n\"We believe that augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have enormous potential to reshape the way we interact with digital content and each other. Our team has made significant progress in developing hardware and software to support these technologies, and we are very excited about the possibilities ahead. [SEP] Not only does it have the possibility of being the next major computing platform, AR and VR together, but I think it has the possibility of being much more social and intuitive and natural than some of the devices that we have today, whether they're computers or phones. [SEP] Of course, there are still many challenges to overcome before AR and VR can become mainstream, such as improving the quality of displays and reducing the cost of production. But we are confident that with continued innovation and investment, we can bring these technologies to mass market in the near future.","1417":"Our focus remains on building and strengthening our user base through innovative product offerings and providing a seamless user experience. [SEP] We're continuing to build out features and functionality for the community across a wide range of different products, whether it be the ad products that Sheryl talked about or IGTV and the like. [SEP] We have seen significant user engagement and growth across these products, and we plan to invest further in their development to drive continued success.","1418":"We've seen some great traction with our Reserved Instances (RIs) program in the past quarter. [SEP] As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. [SEP] In fact, we've seen an uptick in RI adoption over the past few months, which is a positive sign for the long-term growth of our business.","1419":"Can you provide some insight into how the company's revenue growth is performing in North America versus international markets? [SEP] Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there's so many different factors going on in every country that's hard to compare North America to international. [SEP] However, we do track these metrics closely and continue to make adjustments to our strategy based on regional nuances.","1420":"We've been working hard to improve the user experience across all of our platforms. [SEP] I mean we announced this program last year that basically we'll make it so if you pay for something in any of our apps, you only need to enter your credit card once, and then you can use that to have a more frictionless checkout experience across the other apps. [SEP] Since implementing this program, we've seen a significant increase in conversions and customer satisfaction.","1421":"Can you elaborate on the use of Amazon's own delivery network, AMZL? [SEP] In many cases we are already are and the places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for instance, in some cases we\u2019re lacking alternative options for the type of delivery that we\u2019re doing. [SEP] However, we are constantly working on improving our logistics network and exploring new delivery options to provide the best possible service to our customers.","1422":"Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the new product release. [SEP] So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it. [SEP] Okay, thank you for the clarity. My other question is in regards to the sales projections for Q3.","1423":"Our dividend yield has been consistently solid over the years. I would like to announce that our board has just approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividends. [SEP] So we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the investors that value income. [SEP] We also believe that this increase will attract more investors who prioritize steady income. Despite the current market challenges, we remain committed to providing value to our shareholders through stable dividend payments.","1424":"We will now take some questions from the analysts on the call. The first question is from John Smith from XYZ Research. [SEP] And then secondly in some markets as I had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets. [SEP] Do you have any plans to address this issue going forward, and if so, how do you plan to do it?","1425":"Moving on to our customer base, I want to highlight the growth we have seen in the past quarter. [SEP] Now in the past, sometimes we had also given a total active customers count, and so that number for this quarter was over $310 million. [SEP] This is a record high for us, and we are extremely pleased with the continued engagement and loyalty of our customers.","1426":"During the quarter, we saw solid growth in our international markets. [SEP] Obviously, we were particularly pleased that there was really strong demand that benefited regions like APAC and rest-of-world, so really broad-based strength in APAC. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in these regions due to a number of factors, including increased investment in infrastructure and a growing middle class.","1427":"Our new delivery system has really been a game-changer for our business. [SEP] As Brian's mentioned, allowed them to shop even up to Christmas Eve and then have their items delivered in two hours. [SEP] This has resulted in a significant increase in sales during the holiday season, and we plan to expand the service to other major holidays throughout the year.","1428":"In terms of our new product rollout strategy, we have received some concerns from investors about potential cannibalization. [SEP] So, at least in the intermediate timeframe, we do not see cannibalization. [SEP] However, we will continue to closely monitor the market and adjust our strategy accordingly if necessary.","1429":"With the ongoing global pandemic, the hospitality industry has been hit hard. [SEP] And that has driven tourism, international shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago. [SEP] However, we have been able to offset some of these losses through increased online shopping and e-commerce sales.","1430":"We are pleased to announce that our earnings for the December quarter exceeded our expectations. [SEP] And so the idea for us is to continue to invest in the business, making the right trade-offs and the results from the December quarter give us very good confidence for the future. [SEP] We believe that our ongoing investments will enable us to maintain our competitive edge and achieve our long-term strategic objectives.","1431":"Let me talk a little bit about our gaming segment. [SEP] There are about -- I think it\u2019s around 250 million people who have Xboxes, Play Station, or Wiis.

[SEP] On the issue you raised with the Facebook female engineers, I'm really glad to have a chance to address this because this is an issue I take very seriously.

[SEP] This helps provide more accurate reporting of our operating expenses.","1437":"We have seen incredible growth in our iPad sales in the past quarter and we attribute this to our continued innovation in the product line and our efforts to expand our reach globally. Our iPads have become an essential tool for students, professionals, and creatives alike.

However, we want to make it clear that we are not setting a specific margin target for any given year. [SEP] In terms of our long-term margins, we\u2019re not managing the business to a specific margin target in any year.

[SEP] This shift in moderation approach will require additional resources and investment, but we believe it is necessary to create a safer and more welcoming community for our users.","1462":"In terms of our latest product release, I'm pleased to report that we've received extremely positive feedback thus far. [SEP] I think that the vast majority of people are very happy with it, including the most important people at all, which is the user.

[SEP] It's the rationale for why we're putting a huge investment in the home, making \u2013 really bringing home automation to life for people in a very simple and elegant way. [SEP] We believe that by offering an intuitive and user-friendly platform, we can capture a significant portion of the growing home automation market.","1464":"We've heard a lot of chatter in the industry about a certain trend that is supposedly the key to success.\n- Many have claimed that this trend is essential to remain competitive in the market. [SEP] So it's a good sounding theory, and I can get why people repeat it, but it's not true. [SEP] Our data shows that companies who focus on this trend actually perform worse than those who do not prioritize it.\n- In fact, we've seen an inverse relationship between the amount of resources allocated to this trend and overall profitability.","1465":"One factor that we are always keeping an eye on is the quality of our online advertisements. [SEP] If ad quality was low, we wouldn't be able to put as many ads in because people wouldn't want them. [SEP] That being said, we are constantly striving to improve our ad quality to ensure that our customers are satisfied and engaged with the content they are seeing.","1466":"Now moving on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] It's also \u2013 there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. [SEP] However, we're keeping a close eye on currency fluctuations and their potential impact on our future performance.","1467":"Can you give us an update on the states where our products have been legalized? [SEP] So Washington State started as of January 1, Pennsylvania as of April 1, and most recently Oklahoma on July 1. [SEP] Do you have any plans to expand into other states in the near future?","1468":"Our sales have exceeded expectations this quarter, and we're excited to share the results with you. [SEP] so not only was it a great day for Amazon, it was also a great day for our sellers which is great. [SEP] We continue to invest in new technologies and initiatives to help our sellers grow their businesses on our platform.","1469":"We've received a lot of questions about our Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) and its potential for growth. [SEP] But now with the growth of actually mobile devices and SaaS applications, our opportunity with EMS is much bigger than anything that we had in the client server era [SEP] We believe that EMS will continue to be a major driver of our revenue growth as more businesses adopt a mobile-first approach to their operations.","1470":"We are thrilled to report that our company has experienced significant growth this quarter, with earnings exceeding our expectations. We continue to invest in and expand our logistics and fulfillment capabilities, which are proving to be a key factor in our success. [SEP] I would say that while our 20-year head start in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that we've built are helping us, we also do have a network that is tuned to two-day delivery right now, principally for two-day delivery. [SEP] In addition to our focus on two-day delivery, we are also exploring ways to enhance our next-day and same-day delivery services, as we recognize the importance of speed in e-commerce. We remain committed to providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience, and we believe that our investment in logistics and fulfillment will help us to achieve that goal.","1471":"Our earnings report for the fourth quarter shows that we have exceeded market expectations. We saw a significant increase in revenue during the last few months of the year, and we believe that this trend will continue into 2021. [SEP] And I think we were quite encouraged by E5 performance, particularly in Q4 as we ended the quarter, which was great to see. [SEP] Moving forward, we will be focusing on expanding our operations in international markets. We have identified several key areas where we believe there is significant potential for growth, and we are actively pursuing new partnerships and collaborations in these regions. Overall, we are optimistic about our prospects for the coming year, and we believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on emerging trends and market opportunities.","1472":"Now that we've discussed our US operations, let's turn to our international business. [SEP] So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com and built off that base. [SEP] Joyo.com has been a key asset for our growth in the Chinese market, and we continue to see exciting opportunities for expansion.","1473":"As we continue to invest in our digital platform, we are seeing a shift in how our employees communicate and collaborate. [SEP] Some of our social tools like Yammer are increasingly getting used for broad communications, inclusive of Skype for Teams. [SEP] We anticipate that with the growing adoption of remote work, these tools will become even more essential for our teams to stay connected and productive.","1474":"Can you speak to the ownership rights and distribution of your original content? [SEP] So the content that we are creating, especially through Amazon Studios, we are generally holding the worldwide rights to and can use that in other countries as well. [SEP] This gives us a significant advantage over traditional studios who often have to negotiate separate licensing deals for each individual territory.","1475":"Our company has achieved some incredible milestones this quarter, particularly in the technology sector that we operate in. [SEP] They're pretty significant when you add up all the things that we have done in the Office 365 space, all of the things that we have done in the Azure space [SEP] We believe that these accomplishments are a testament to the hard work of our employees and the strength of our partnerships, and we are excited to continue building on this momentum in the future.","1476":"We've seen tremendous success with our recent ad campaigns. [SEP] If you're trying to sell a direct product, then you want to use DPA ads. [SEP] Additionally, we've found that incorporating influencer marketing into our strategy has also been effective.","1477":"Our user engagement metrics have continued to improve over the past quarter, particularly in the area of video consumption. As we look at the data, we see that users are spending more time than ever before watching videos on our platform. [SEP] So, when we talk about the time spent per DAU growing worldwide across our family in double-digit percentages, video is making a contribution there more broadly. [SEP] This trend is particularly evident in emerging markets, where video is becoming an increasingly important source of entertainment and information. We believe that our investment in video content and technology is paying off, and we remain committed to delivering the best possible video experience to our users around the world.","1478":"Many of our clients have been asking about the effectiveness of our advertising platform. We understand that the market is becoming more crowded, and competition is intensifying. [SEP] But we think we offer something pretty compelling, which is the reach of Facebook with very unique targeting. [SEP] We are constantly seeking ways to improve our platform and offer more value to our clients. As we continue to invest in new technologies and expand our reach, we are confident that our platform will remain a top choice for advertisers looking to reach their target audience.","1479":"We've been working hard to improve our delivery services and keep up with the increased demand during the pandemic. [SEP] So the immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but we're confident that we will have a good service and continue to delight customers. [SEP] Additionally, we're constantly seeking feedback from our customers to identify areas where we can make further improvements to our service.","1480":"We've been seeing strong growth in Azure usage across a variety of industries and geographies. Our goal is to continue to provide a robust and flexible platform that meets the needs of our customers. [SEP] So - and then, they represent different use cases in terms of the components of Azure that get used. [SEP] For example, some customers primarily use Azure for its compute and storage capabilities, while others focus on its machine learning and analytics tools. We're constantly working to develop new features and services that can meet these diverse needs and help our customers drive value from their data.","1481":"We've had some questions recently about the timeline for our new product release. [SEP] So I don't think of it as a delay in the way you're talking about it. [SEP] It's more of a strategic decision to ensure that the product is fully optimized and meets all of our standards before it goes to market.","1482":"Our team has been focusing on expanding our Stories feature and we are excited about the growth we've seen so far. [SEP] So as we bring more formats to Stories and bring more advertisers to Stories, we can build up that demand and balance that out with supply. [SEP] We have also made significant strides in improving the targeting capabilities for our advertisers on Stories, which has resulted in better performance and ROI. We believe that the continued expansion and optimization of our Stories offering will be a key driver of our revenue growth in the coming quarters.","1483":"When it comes to our brick and mortar stores, we have made significant strides in developing our physical presence. [SEP] We of course have Amazon bookstores, 18 bookstores in the U.S. [SEP] Our strategy with these bookstores is to provide customers with a unique, immersive shopping experience that can't be replicated online.","1484":"We have seen an unprecedented increase in online shopping during the pandemic. [SEP] We will continue to add fulfillment capacity, we will work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of fourth quarter with immense learnings [SEP] As we look ahead to the next quarter, we are also exploring opportunities to expand our international presence and enter new markets.","1485":"Can you speak to the strategy behind your recent product development?

[SEP] And I think that approach has really paid off in terms of our sales growth in international markets.","1486":"We're now going to open up the call for questions. [SEP] And the link to basically do the messaging is over Messenger, but in that country, where people really want to be using it, is WhatsApp and we need to make it so that people can communicate across the different networks and graphs that they have or be able to do that integration better in order to facilitate more transactions and connections there. [SEP] So, we're actively working on improving that integration between Messenger and WhatsApp to make it easier for our users to connect and transact seamlessly between the two platforms.","1487":"As we look ahead to the next fiscal year, we want to remain focused on our strategic objectives. [SEP] We're just trying to make the best decisions we can to grow long-term free cash flow per share. [SEP] With our current market position, we believe there are opportunities for us to capitalize on in the near term.","1488":"We are currently seeing strong demand in our existing regions and are considering expanding our reach. [SEP] So it will be demand-driven, but I don't want to essentially put a cap because if the opportunity arises, and for us it's a high ROI decision to open a new region, we will do so. [SEP] However, we will closely analyze market conditions and weigh the potential risks before making any big decisions.","1489":"We've seen some incredible growth within our product offerings over the past year. Our customers continue to express appreciation for the services we provide and we are thrilled with the results. [SEP] And our goal is to just constantly refine this and make it better and we're going to keep on doing that because we think there's a lot of upside and there's a lot more that we can do. [SEP] As we move forward, we plan to invest heavily in research and development to ensure we stay ahead of the competition. We have a strong team in place to tackle these challenges and we look forward to continuing to drive great results for our customers and shareholders.","1490":"We've recently seen a surge in engagement on our platform, particularly in certain demographics. [SEP] And I think it's going to be one of the next big areas that I'm really excited about the Facebook uptick. [SEP] We're actively working on developing new features and tools to enhance this experience for both our users and advertisers.","1491":"We are excited to announce that we have received approval from the FAA to conduct drone operations beyond visual line-of-sight in certain designated areas. This is a significant milestone for our company and for the industry as a whole. [SEP] This is providing us with permission to trial new methods in the space, including beyond line-of-sight operation, sense-and-avoid technologies and flights where one person operates multiple drones. [SEP] We believe that these new methods can revolutionize the way drones are used in a wide range of applications, from agriculture to transportation to public safety. We are committed to working closely with our partners and customers to develop and test these technologies in a safe and responsible manner, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming months.","1492":"We are seeing significant growth in our international markets and we have particular interest in the potential for growth in China. [SEP] As you point out, and I think this is a major point that many people miss, the LTE penetration in China is only at 12%. [SEP] We believe that as LTE penetration in China increases, we will see even more opportunities for growth in that market.","1493":"We've seen strong growth in our Surface and gaming businesses, which are giving us reason for optimism going into the next fiscal year.\n- Despite a challenging economic environment, we're continuing to invest heavily in R&D to ensure that we're well positioned for long-term growth.\n- Our cloud and productivity offerings continue to gain traction with enterprise customers, with Azure and Office 365 both showing strong growth in the past quarter. [SEP] But I think as I look to 2016, I\u2019m excited about the designs we\u2019ve seen, I\u2019m excited about the products that are possible with Windows 10, and I think we feel good and are looking forward to sharing some of that excitement next week.

[SEP] We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018. [SEP] We believe that expanding our video offerings will not only enhance our user engagement, but also attract new advertisers to our platform.","1495":"We've seen a lot of interest in our advertising platform from developers who want to run mobile app install ads. [SEP] We don't break out marketer segments, but mobile app install ads, which is where the revenue would come from developers, is a relatively small part of our advertising revenue [SEP] Our primary focus for advertising revenue is on our core ad products, including sponsored posts and feed ads.","1496":"Our video content and marketing strategy has been successful in driving user engagement and subscriptions. We believe that video is a key driver for our business and we want to continue investing in it.

Our goal is to become the go-to destination for high-quality video content.","1497":"We are pleased to announce our earnings for the quarter ending June 30th.

[SEP] We attribute this strong performance to our continued focus on cost-cutting measures and the successful introduction of new products.","1498":"Our company has seen some significant changes in the global currency market over the last year. [SEP] Because on a year-over-year basis actually the impact is larger, given the fact that currencies have moved during the last 12 months. [SEP] However, despite this impact on our earnings, we are confident in our ability to maintain our strong financial performance going forward.","1499":"We've seen tremendous growth in our service offerings over the past year. [SEP] The way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our customers in the future. [SEP] We're constantly listening to customer feedback and exploring new technology to improve our offerings.","1500":"Can you discuss how you measure the success of your services business?\" \n- \"What is the breakdown of your revenue streams across hardware, software, and services? [SEP] And so as we\u2019ve always said, there is a large part of the -- or the vast majority of the services are mapped to the install base instead of the quarterly sales. [SEP] Does this mean that your services revenue is more predictable and stable than your hardware or software revenue?\" \n- \"Are you considering expanding your services offerings in the future?","1501":"As we continue to navigate through the current market conditions, we recognize the importance of executing on our growth initiatives. [SEP] And so, we're working very hard to -- at the -- but at the very beginning of the ramp there. [SEP] Our goal is to reach full capacity within the next quarter and we are confident in our ability to do so with the support of our dedicated team.","1502":"Our team has been closely analyzing customer feedback and behavior in order to identify areas where we can improve our services. [SEP] And so we think there's a lot of opportunity there to add convenience for customers. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring partnerships with tech companies to develop innovative solutions that can further enhance the customer experience.","1503":"Now let's talk about our recent advertising campaign on Facebook using Canvas ads. [SEP] They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those Canvas ads, so clearly people were really engaged in the brand experience of the ads, and they had a 13-point lift in add recall and a 9-point lift in purchase intent. [SEP] Overall, we're extremely pleased with the results and plan to continue using this format in future campaigns.","1504":"Our technology team has been working diligently to improve the features and functionality of our products.

[SEP] This is a testament to our commitment to providing the best possible user experience to our customers.","1505":"Thank you for those insights. I have a question about your product offerings. [SEP] And then on the technology side, as you said, yes we will continue and invest in SDEs and software engineers to build these you know products that customers love, continue to respond to their demands, and that will push or inform our product portfolio. [SEP] Can you give us more details on the specific types of products you're planning to develop in the next quarter?","1506":"So, onto some good news. As you know, we launched our new advertising platform last quarter, and I'm pleased to report that it's been a great success so far. [SEP] I talked about Mary Barra and what she and I did together in New York at Adweek, and we're seeing them not just use the platform for advertising but really use the platform. [SEP] We've already seen a significant increase in engagement and click-through rates compared to our old platform, and we're confident that this will translate into revenue growth over the coming quarters.","1507":"We've received a few questions about the operating margin in the AWS segment, so I'd like to address that now. [SEP] So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. [SEP] However, long-term trends demonstrate that our investments are paying off and contributing to the continued success and expansion of the AWS business.","1508":"Looking ahead, let's talk about our revenue projections for the next quarter. [SEP] We continue to expect that we'll see deceleration in ad revenue growth. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions, as we have done in the past.","1509":"Investor: Can you discuss the margin improvement in your AWS business? \n\nCompany Representative: Yes, we can definitely speak to that. [SEP] So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business. [SEP] In fact, our AWS margins have seen significant improvements over the past few quarters. We anticipate that trend to continue as we place more emphasis on innovation and operation strategies that drive efficiency. Ultimately, our goal is to provide our customers with high-quality cloud computing solutions at an affordable price.","1510":"Our company has been looking for ways to expand our original content offerings and bring in new, fresh voices to collaborate with.

[SEP] Yes, I think vision that we have always had is that distributed computing in some sense will remain distributed. [SEP] However, we do see trends towards more centralized cloud solutions for certain industries and use cases, and we are monitoring these developments closely.","1512":"Our focus for the next quarter is to continue enhancing our autonomous vehicle technology. [SEP] As you do more of that, what happens is you need to - and then you start doing sensor fusion, which is your multiple sensors that you want to be able to fuse and take action. [SEP] We believe that by integrating sensor fusion into our vehicles, we will be able to provide a safer and more efficient driving experience for our customers.","1513":"Our Q2 earnings release shows strong performance across all of our business segments. [SEP] We are continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we are in, but we are also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace Prime and AWS. [SEP] We believe these investments will position us well for future growth and success.","1514":"Can you elaborate on your marketing strategy for this quarter? [SEP] So, obviously, we started with ads in Facebook, and that was something we have grown and they continue to grow. [SEP] But we've also expanded our advertising efforts to include Instagram and Google, which have shown promising results.","1515":"We have a question from one of our analysts on the line about your company's ability to accurately track user engagement on mobile devices. [SEP] In terms of measurement capabilities, I don't think there's a direct thing we're exactly worried about right now. [SEP] However, we are always looking for ways to improve our measurement capabilities and stay ahead of industry standards.","1516":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. I'm pleased to report that our company has continued to demonstrate strong performance, exceeding our expectations in several areas.

Thank you for your continued support and trust in our company.","1517":"We've been working on some new features that I want to share with you all today. [SEP] There are a few big reasons why I'm excited about this and think it'll be good for the user experience, which is the reason that we're doing it. [SEP] First of all, it's going to make the app much faster and more reliable. Additionally, it will enable us to provide more personalized content and recommendations to our users, which we know is something they've been asking for.","1518":"One area that we're seeing continued strength is in video content. We've been investing heavily in video over the past few years, and our efforts are paying off. [SEP] So we're ranking longer-form video, but that's still relatively short video views. [SEP] We're also seeing strong engagement with our live video offerings, particularly in the news and sports categories. We remain committed to continuing to invest in video content and improving the user experience.","1519":"We've seen some positive trends in our sales numbers this quarter. [SEP] And so it's still down year over year but less so than it was and part of that is the compare is an easier compare. [SEP] Additionally, our cost-cutting measures have helped mitigate the impact of lower revenue.","1520":"During the quarter, we faced significant headwinds due to the ongoing global economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. In spite of these challenges, we were able to deliver solid results thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees. [SEP] On a profitability standpoint, our hedging program partially mitigated the impact from the volatility in currencies. [SEP] Looking ahead, we expect the currency market to remain volatile in the coming months. However, we are confident that our hedging program will continue to provide us with some degree of protection against currency fluctuations. We remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives and delivering value to our stakeholders.","1521":"Our company has seen significant growth in the amount of data we collect and store from our customers. It's become clear that data management is a top priority for our industry. [SEP] I do think that there is a very broad sense, as you're saying, that - and greater awareness that having data stored for long periods of time with companies cannot only be an asset, and that it can help provide better services but can also be a liability in that there could be breaches or the data could be used in ways that weren't intended. [SEP] To address these concerns, we've implemented stricter data security protocols and are working closely with regulators to ensure compliance with emerging privacy laws. We believe that responsible data stewardship is essential for building trust with our customers and maintaining our competitive edge in the marketplace.","1522":"Let's now turn to our services segment, which represented a new all-time revenue record in the June quarter. [SEP] We have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly, faster than the App Store from a much lower base, but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses. [SEP] We believe that the services category is going to continue to grow, and we're very excited about the contributions that iCloud and our other services will make to Apple's future.","1523":"Our company has seen a significant increase in demand for our server products over the past year. [SEP] Having been in the server business all my life, I've never seen a lot of the small business customers adopt some of the rich capabilities like it's possible now, and that's great growth as well. [SEP] We've been working closely with our partners to ensure that our small business customers are aware of these new capabilities and can take full advantage of them.","1524":"Our team has been working tirelessly on brainstorming ways to grow and strengthen our cloud technology offerings. [SEP] We really have a view of distributed computing which is more expansive doing just even our HyperScale cloud. [SEP] This approach not only aligns with our company's goals but also allows us to meet the increasing demand for cutting-edge computing solutions in today's digital landscape.","1525":"We have continued to focus on improving the overall customer experience with our products and services. As part of this effort, we have invested heavily in new technologies and introduced new features and enhancements. [SEP] Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices. [SEP] To achieve our goal, we are leveraging our extensive data and analytics capabilities to better understand consumer preferences and behaviors. We are also partnering with top brands and retailers to offer a wider selection of high-quality products at competitive prices. By doing so, we are confident that we can continue to drive growth and deliver long-term shareholder value.","1526":"We are proud to report a strong quarter with earnings exceeding expectations. [SEP] So these are capabilities that are not easy to build if you don't have a real commitment to research and then the ability to take that research and then ultimately turn into products. [SEP] However, we recognize that competition in the market is fierce and we must remain focused on innovation in order to stay ahead.","1527":"Now I'd like to discuss our marketing strategy moving forward. [SEP] What we\u2019ve definitely done over the last year and plan to invest even more in over the next year is worked hard on vertical specific targeting. [SEP] We've seen promising results so far and believe that this targeted approach will continue to drive growth in our key markets.","1528":"One analyst on the earnings conference call asked about the company's revenue projections for the upcoming year.

[SEP] Our real goal for LinkedIn is \u2013 over time of course I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets. [SEP] But at the end of the day, our real goal is to continue to drive growth and create value for our shareholders through this acquisition.","1530":"Our company has seen significant growth in the past year. [SEP] I can't give an exact split of the investments by geography, but I would say most of the fulfillment expansion was in North America last year. [SEP] We also expanded our e-commerce capabilities in South America and Asia.","1531":"Our company's core value is to prioritize our customers' needs and satisfaction. [SEP] What we focus on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic footprint to make our services more widely available. [SEP] We believe that by doing so, we can achieve sustainable growth and profitability in the long term.","1532":"I'd also like to touch on our revenue growth drivers and how they relate to our active installed base. As you know, our revenue is derived from a combination of transaction fees and subscription fees. So, let's break down our revenue growth drivers and how they contribute to our overall business. [SEP] They're more correlated to the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that we have. [SEP] So, as you can see, our revenue growth drivers are tightly linked to our active installed base and the health of our customer relationships. We're constantly looking for ways to improve our offerings and provide more value to our customers, which in turn drives growth for our business. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions.","1533":"In terms of our product development strategy, we're always looking for ways to expand our offerings and address new customer needs. [SEP] So I think we'll continue to iterate on those and try to find different areas. [SEP] Of course, we'll also be keeping a close eye on industry trends and competitive pressures as we develop our next generation of products.","1534":"Now, let's turn to our Prime membership and delivery services. [SEP] I mentioned that four years ago when we last increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two days. [SEP] Today, we're proud to say that Prime members have access to over 100 million products with even faster delivery options.","1535":"Looking ahead to the new fiscal year, we have some exciting developments to share with you all today. [SEP] As we get into new fiscal year, so many things change and we need to take that into account, the geographic mix of our products and so on.

[SEP] We're working to increase our production capacity to meet the high demand for these popular products.","1544":"In the last quarter, we saw a significant shift towards mobile usage, especially in emerging markets.

[SEP] What I mean that is that 27% seat growth is starting to include some lower ARPU seats that Satya just mentioned whether that's in academic, in edu, in front-line workers and that's really important for us to keep having that seat growth even if it\u2019s not at the same ARPU level those are not seats that we ever could reach before at any level and that's absolutely new opportunity for us.

[SEP] This increase gives us the capacity to handle more orders, especially during peak seasons. We are very pleased with our progress and we will continue to invest in our fulfillment center network to ensure we can deliver on our promise of fast and reliable shipping to our customers.","1556":"Moving on to our social media platform segment, I would like to provide an update on Facebook.

[SEP] Of course, we will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, as we always have. We remain confident in the strength of our legal position and the diligence of our legal team. Our focus remains on delivering outstanding products and services to our customers around the world.","1608":"We're really excited about the impact we're seeing from the member network and the engagement that's happening across our gaming platforms. Satya spoke earlier about the significant growth we're seeing in the gaming ecosystem, and we believe there's a lot of runway ahead. [SEP] And as I believe, the industry that Satya is talking about pivots to be more about the engagement and monetization of that member network, you can expect that margin profile as well of our traditional, more hardware-focused Xbox to evolve, to be a real combination of those two things going forward. [SEP] We're already seeing progress on this front, with our gaming revenue up 50% year-over-year in Q3. And looking ahead, we're focused on continuing to innovate and deliver new experiences to our members, while also leveraging our hardware expertise to drive margin expansion. Overall, we're confident in the long-term growth potential of our gaming business, and we look forward to sharing more updates in the quarters ahead.","1609":"We are closely monitoring the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. [SEP] There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China. [SEP] We anticipate that this fourth tariff will impact our bottom line and are taking measures to mitigate any potential negative effects.","1610":"We've had a strong year so far, with revenue increasing by double digits compared to fiscal 2018. As we look ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to continue this momentum and achieve our financial goals. [SEP] In general, fiscal 2019 will have a higher base than fiscal 2018, just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year. [SEP] We're closely monitoring market trends and potential headwinds, such as increased competition and macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we're confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and deliver value to our customers. We'll provide more updates on our fiscal 2019 performance in future calls.","1611":"Can you give us an update on the progress of the new factory project? [SEP] And as we were just talking with Carlos, the capital investment is very large as well, so we continue to fund it. [SEP] But overall, we believe this investment will pay off in the long term with increased production and revenue.","1612":"Now moving on to our revenue breakdown.

[SEP] We have seen a significant increase in ARPU since the launch of E3 and expect this trend to continue throughout the year.","1613":"We're very excited about the potential of this new technology. [SEP] But it's got a topology associated with it, going all the way to the sensors, whether it's at home, whether it's in a hospital, whether it's in a factory. [SEP] This topology allows for seamless integration and communication between different devices and systems.","1614":"We have been investing heavily in technology and infrastructure to ensure that we stay ahead of the game. [SEP] And if anything, at our scale, as you can imagine, we are becoming much more efficient in how we use software to utilize the capacity we have. [SEP] This has allowed us to deliver faster and more cost-effective services to our customers, which has resulted in increased revenue and market share.","1615":"One question that we've received from investors is regarding our stance on sales tax collection. [SEP] I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. [SEP] In the meantime, we will continue to comply with all state regulations and act as a responsible member of each community we serve.","1616":"Can you clarify how this quarter's earnings compare to last year's? [SEP] But the numbers are only comparable if I quote the third-party source for both and so that's what I'm doing. [SEP] Thank you for providing that information. Can you speak to any changes in the market that might have affected our performance this quarter?","1617":"When we look at our international segment results, we're really pleased with the momentum we're seeing across multiple countries and categories. [SEP] But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. [SEP] We're going to keep investing in those areas to make sure that we're delivering an exceptional customer experience and continuing to grow our business.","1618":"During the last quarter, we noticed an increase in customer service calls. This brought to light some challenges we face in providing top-quality customer service. [SEP] I don't know many people who like calling businesses to deal with issues that they have. [SEP] As part of our efforts to improve customer satisfaction, we are exploring new technologies that can streamline our customer service process. We also plan to train our customer service representatives to better handle difficult situations and help customers feel heard and appreciated.","1619":"Now let's look at our marketing expenses for the quarter.

With this expansion, we are confident we can continue to grow our business and deliver great results for our customers and shareholders.","1621":"A participant on the call asked about the company's expectations for performance in specific regions.

[SEP] We're seeing a lot of positive trends in our key markets, including strong demand and increasing customer adoption.","1622":"We've had a challenging quarter due to unforeseen circumstances but we are still committed to our goals.

[SEP] We have a clear plan in place to address the current challenges and are confident that we will come out stronger in the end.","1623":"Our team has been working hard over the past quarter to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our customers in terms of compliance and security. [SEP] And the one thing I\u2019d mention is the having compliance security that spans all of these tools, is also proving out to be a very big architectural advantage in a customer value proposition because I think, our customers look to use more SaaS applications, they don't want an exponential increase in their security exposure or more compliance burden. [SEP] In fact, our customer feedback has been extremely positive as they have been able to seamlessly integrate our tools into their existing infrastructure without having to worry about any added security risks.","1624":"Now let's talk about our fourth quarter performance. [SEP] So, really Q4 wasn\u2019t just renewal activity, it was also new workloads and new value. [SEP] We are excited to see this growth and expect it to continue into next year.","1625":"We're seeing great success with our security management strategy and I want to take a moment to talk about that. As you know, security is a top concern for businesses of all sizes and we are focused on providing the best solutions to address those concerns. [SEP] The more important part around the security management value prop is in fact I'm going to pivot back again a little bit, because it's the same thing we saw in Office. [SEP] The success we had with security management in Office is what's driving our pivot. We've found that businesses are looking for a comprehensive and integrated security solution that covers all of their applications and data. By leveraging the knowledge we gained from Office, we're confident we can deliver that solution.","1626":"CEO: \"Now, before we open up the call for questions, I want to take a quick moment to address some of the challenges we've been facing this quarter. As you all know, it's been a difficult few months for the industry as a whole, and we've certainly felt the effects of that.\"\n\nCFO: \"That's right. We've seen some headwinds in a few different areas, but we've also taken steps to mitigate those impacts as much as possible. [SEP] There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacted us. [SEP] CEO: \"So, in summary, there's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacting us. But overall, we're feeling pretty optimistic about the direction we're headed in.\" \n\nCFO: \"Exactly. And we're constantly evaluating our strategies and looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve. It's not always easy, but we've got a great team in place who are dedicated to making this company a success.","1627":"Thank you for joining us today on our earnings conference call.

[SEP] This means investing in efficient and effective ways of doing business, including updating our technology and streamlining our operations.","1629":"We want to assure our customers that we take data protection and privacy laws very seriously. [SEP] With our EU-approved AWS data protection agreement and model clauses we have in place, AWS customers can keep running their global operations using AWS and be in compliance with the e-law.

So every day, we're striving to be the best possible partner we can be, and we're always looking for ways to improve.","1631":"We have seen tremendous growth in our cloud services division this quarter. In particular, our Azure platform continues to be a major driver of revenue. [SEP] The way that -- the only other way that, that Azure number, to think about it, is when we've talked about the Azure Hybrid Benefits that exist, those show up actually in the on-prem number, right, even if they ultimately get used on the Azure side. [SEP] This is because these benefits are essentially discounts that are applied to our customers' existing on-premises software licenses when they transfer those licenses to Azure. Therefore, it makes sense for us to attribute these benefits to our on-prem numbers. However, it's important to note that they still account for significant revenue for our Azure business overall.","1632":"We are pleased to present our earnings report for the third quarter of the fiscal year. [SEP] Anthony, on the on the marketing budgets, we continue to think we've got great opportunities to grow in the large global advertising market.

In the quarter, commercial cloud revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, driven by outstanding performance in Azure and Dynamics 365. [SEP] And really, driver of these per user services, such as EMS, actually is the value proposition that Satya refers to, and we refer to as Microsoft 365 and we saw strength broadly. [SEP] Looking ahead, we see continued opportunity for growth as organizations increasingly turn to us for their digital transformation needs. We're investing heavily in areas like AI, IoT, and cybersecurity to ensure we remain a trusted partner for our customers. Overall, we're very confident in the long-term trajectory of our business.","1640":"Moving on to our supply chain, I want to share some numbers with you. As you know, we are committed to supporting American businesses and investing in our local communities. [SEP] If you look at the second area, we have purchased \u2013 or we purchased last year about $50 billion worth of goods and services from U.S.-based suppliers.

We believe this not only benefits our company but also contributes to the growth of the American economy. Our goal is to continue to prioritize local partnerships and supplier diversity.","1641":"I'd now like to turn to our long-term asset management strategy. [SEP] As we looked in Q4 of 2019, we believe it's -- there's enough trend now to show that the useful life is exceeding four years.

We will continue to monitor this trend in the coming months and adjust our asset management plan accordingly. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in Q4 and remain optimistic about the future of our company.","1642":"We are always looking for opportunities to expand our advertising reach and increase revenue. Our recent venture into video ads has been quite successful and we see potential for growth in this area. [SEP] But the opportunity to take not just video ads, but other ad formats we have, bring them to the rest of the web and other apps with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one. [SEP] We are currently exploring partnerships with other major websites and apps to bring our targeted advertising capabilities to a wider audience. This will not only benefit our company, but also provide more effective advertising solutions for our clients. The future looks bright as we continue to innovate and adapt to the rapidly changing digital landscape.","1643":"We've made some significant changes to our operations over the past few months, and I'm pleased to report that we're already seeing positive results. [SEP] So on that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search capacity, and also good costs. [SEP] We're confident that these improvements will continue to drive growth and profitability in the coming quarters.","1644":"Our international expansion efforts have been successful, largely due to our ability to tailor our offerings to local markets. China represents a particularly promising area for growth, and we are investing heavily in our operations there. [SEP] Offerings like the Amazon Global Store where Chinese customers can access those international brands on the China website and have them shipped directly to their houses is something we're focused on. [SEP] Of course, while we are confident in our growth strategy, we are also aware of the challenges in the Chinese market. Regulatory and cultural differences can be significant obstacles to success, but we are committed to finding innovative ways to overcome them.  Overall, we remain bullish on our long-term prospects in China and elsewhere around the world.","1645":"During the first quarter of 2016, we experienced strong demand for our iPhone products.

[SEP] This is a great indicator of the effectiveness of our content strategy and the loyalty of our customers.","1647":"We've seen a significant shift in user behavior over the past few years. [SEP] When you think about the transition or people using feed versus Stories, there are a couple of things that are different. [SEP] We're constantly working to improve the user experience on both platforms and provide more options for our users.","1648":"We received a lot of questions about our plans for search on Facebook, so I want to address that now. [SEP] On the search opportunity, there's a growing number of searches on Facebook, but we're still a ways off from monetization. [SEP] However, we're excited about the potential for this area and are actively exploring ways to effectively monetize search on our platform in a way that benefits both our users and advertisers.

We anticipate continued growth in this area in the coming year.","1651":"Now, turning to our financial performance for the quarter... [SEP] And then keep in mind that there were a couple of things that affect the compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago, we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year.

Overall, we are pleased with our continued growth and profitability.","1652":"We had a strong finish to the year, with solid results across all segments. [SEP] So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin.

We believe that this trend will continue to accelerate and that we are well positioned to be a leader in this space. We remain committed to innovation and to providing our customers with the tools they need to succeed in a rapidly changing business landscape.","1656":"We have a question from a caller in regards to our international operations. [SEP] And I'll talk a little bit about Japan and Walter to answer your question, I don't have any concerns if that expands such that in this unique issue beyond Japan, with the Windows end of XP plus the VAT increase, I do think, as well as some of the macroeconomic environments, it tightened far faster than we had anticipated and Japan in particular because of its model for us, it is a non-annuity geography for us. [SEP] Now, let's move on to discussing our upcoming product launches. \n\n\"And I'll talk a little bit about Japan and Walter to answer your question, I don't have any concerns if that expands such that in this unique issue beyond Japan, with the Windows end of XP plus the VAT increase, I do think, as well as some of the macroeconomic environments, it tightened far faster than we had anticipated and Japan in particular because of its model for us, it is a non-annuity geography for us.

[SEP] We believe that this growth can be sustained as we continue to innovate and bring new and exciting products to market.","1665":"We have been closely analyzing our inventory management and supply chain operations over the past quarter. [SEP] And so to the degree that sales are distributed in the countries with disproportionally with shorter supply chains, or the standard deviation demand is less, we would always choose to have less inventory in those countries. [SEP] However, we understand the importance of meeting customer demand and will continue to make adjustments to our inventory levels as needed based on market trends and consumer behavior.","1666":"As we navigate through these challenging times, our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees, customers, and partners.

People are increasingly looking for convenience and customization, especially in the digital space. Our company has been adapting to these changes, but it's important to keep a long-term perspective.

[SEP] Of course, we still monitor our financial performance on a regular basis. However, we try to look beyond the immediate numbers and focus on the underlying drivers of our success. This approach has served us well over the years and we believe it will continue to do so in the future.","1672":"We're now going to open the call up to questions from our investors and analysts.

[SEP] So we do have Stories ads available across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and I think one of the most important things we learned as we were doing it transition to mobile is if we made it easy for our advertisers to place the ads, make sure they understood the measurement they were having and also make sure the ad format worked, businesses would move more quickly. [SEP] Our investments in ad measurement and targeting capabilities have allowed us to deliver more relevant and effective ads to our users, which has in turn driven higher engagement and revenue for our advertisers.","1674":"We've seen strong growth in our services business this quarter. [SEP] Our services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins. [SEP] In fact, our services business accounted for over a third of our total revenue for the quarter.","1675":"We continue to see strong adoption and usage of our family of apps, with over 2.7 billion monthly active users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. We're also investing heavily in new areas like VR and AR to build the future of computing. [SEP] So I mean across the whole family of apps, I mean all of this engagement is growing quickly and we're very happy with how we're enabling people to share. [SEP] In terms of monetization, we're seeing particularly strong growth in our ad business, driven by increasing demand from advertisers for our targeting and measurement capabilities. Overall, we remain focused on delivering value for our users and advertisers while investing for long-term growth.","1676":"We have some exciting updates to share with you all on our streaming services. [SEP] Obviously, we need to make some assumptions around the take rate of our customers on the -- on Apple TV+, right. [SEP] But based on our market research and early customer feedback, we feel confident in our projections for this platform.","1677":"During the conference call, a participant asked about the slow adoption rate of voice calling in certain regions. [SEP] So one of our theories in this is that it's one of the reasons why voice calling has been a little slower to catch on is because you need the large established network of people who you know will have access to be able to receive a voice call before it, before that behavior can really take on in a big global community. [SEP] However, we are seeing a shift in this trend as more and more people gain access to reliable networks and mobile devices.","1678":"During the last quarter, our subscriber base grew by 10% year-over-year, reaching over 300 million paid subscriptions. [SEP] There are, within the 300 million-plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third party video subscriptions and we see the growth that is going on there. [SEP] We expect the trend towards third-party video subscriptions to continue and plan to invest in this area to further enhance our offering to customers.","1679":"Our team has been working tirelessly to develop innovative solutions that cater to the evolving needs of our users. [SEP] We have a good operating system release for the core desktop user, and second, I believe is that we also expand out into new usage patterns. [SEP] Our aim is to offer a comprehensive suite of products and services that cater to a wide range of user preferences, and we are confident that our latest offerings will appeal to both our existing user base and new customers.","1680":"Can you speak more to the adoption of Stories by advertisers? [SEP] First, we need to convince marketers that people are using Stories, and I think having seen the mobile shift, their process \u2013 they\u2019re getting that I think more quickly. [SEP] Additionally, we are seeing strong engagement metrics from our users on Stories, which should reassure marketers about the potential impact of this format on their campaigns.","1681":"Now let's turn to our sales strategy for the upcoming year. [SEP] In fact there is always, and I think we also talked about how we get licenses sold and then, or subscriptions sold and then there's deployment. [SEP] Our focus this year will be to improve our deployment process to ensure a seamless experience for our customers.","1682":"Now moving on to our advertising business. [SEP] On the demand side, all of the things we do to get more advertisers active in our system, means we'll have more ads to choose from, to make those ads more relevant, to measure the ROI of those ads so that people can then iterate and, again, make those more relevant. [SEP] Overall, we are seeing strong growth in our advertising revenue as we continue to improve our system and attract new advertisers.","1683":"We're excited to announce our new advertising strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] We're going to all know a lot more after we roll out, but the thing that won't change is that advertisers are going to look at the highest ROI opportunity. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to ensure that our new campaign will achieve the highest level of return on investment for our clients.","1684":"We are pleased to announce that our earnings for the past quarter have exceeded our expectations. One of the contributing factors to our success is the performance of our data centers. [SEP] Obviously, part of that was in the capital leases being flat year-over-year, and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher efficiency. [SEP] In addition, we have been exploring new technologies and partnerships to further optimize our operations and reduce our energy consumption. We believe that by continuing to innovate, we can maintain our competitive edge and deliver value to our customers and shareholders alike.","1685":"Our overall revenue for the quarter exceeded our expectations. [SEP] We had a, as I think Dave mentioned, the Echo Dot was the highest selling unit globally, so devices had very strong sales in the quarter. [SEP] Additionally, we saw growth in our services segment, particularly with the expansion of our streaming platform.","1686":"We are now going to address questions from analysts. [SEP] As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. [SEP] We have also seen great demand for the new Apple Watch Series 2 and AirPods. Our retail stores have been bustling with customers eager to get their hands on these products. Overall, we are very pleased with the reception of our latest releases and look forward to continued success in the future.","1687":"I would like to address a question we received from one of our investors regarding our decision to invest in Marketplace. [SEP] So I think your basic point is right, that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab around that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things. [SEP] As a result, we saw an opportunity to create a dedicated platform within Facebook to support buying and selling activities. Since launching Marketplace, we have seen significant growth and engagement within our community.","1688":"We've received a lot of feedback from our clients about our platform. [SEP] And all they need is just a very robust field service module that's cost-effective and efficient. [SEP] With that in mind, our team is currently focused on developing and launching a state-of-the-art field service module that meets all of our clients' needs.","1689":"Our company is pleased to report strong financial results for this quarter.\n- Despite some challenges in certain areas, we believe our overall strategy is proving successful.\n- Our team has been working tirelessly to execute on our business plan and drive growth. [SEP] For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. [SEP] This unit growth was driven by a number of factors, including new product launches, targeted marketing campaigns, and improved customer retention.\n- We are particularly encouraged by the growth we have seen in emerging markets, where we are investing heavily to build brand awareness and expand our footprint.\n- Looking ahead, we remain committed to delivering strong results for our shareholders and creating value for all our stakeholders.","1690":"During the Q&A session, a participant asked about the progress Facebook has made in improving its content moderation policies. [SEP] But if you look at areas like hate speech, which are just much more nuanced linguistically, it really depends on the local language, that's an area where I think it's going to take more years to be able to do something reasonably. [SEP] However, we have made significant progress in detecting and removing terrorist propaganda and graphic violence. We are constantly improving our AI technology and working with experts to help us better understand the cultural nuances of different countries and languages.","1691":"Looking at the revenue figures for this quarter, I'm pleased to see that we have exceeded our targets. [SEP] What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing and it is encouraging that the plan that we put in place, that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on. [SEP] As we continue to grow and expand our customer base, I believe we will see even more positive results in the months and years to come.","1692":"Investor: \"Can you speak to any potential changes in expenses going forward? [SEP] So I don't feel like you'd expect any material change in those, Mark. [SEP] CEO: \"No, I don't think there will be any significant changes in our expenses in the near future.","1693":"Now turning to our long-term strategy. [SEP] So if you think back to how we've talked about the long term, the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over time, and we had lots of encouraging signs about that. [SEP] We're confident that this focus on lifetime value will continue to drive growth and success for the company.","1694":"Now, let's talk about our financial performance over the past year. [SEP] I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. [SEP] This impressive growth can be attributed to the implementation of our new marketing strategy and increased investment in technology.","1695":"As we review our financial performance for the year, I would like to highlight a few key trends that influenced our results. [SEP] We also have a more difficult memory pricing environment this year than a year ago. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain optimistic about our ability to navigate the market and deliver on our long-term growth strategy.","1696":"We are seeing tremendous growth in our user base over the past quarter [SEP] And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share so many different kinds of content, ranging from text to photo to video, just richer and richer and more immersive content. [SEP] As a result, we have been investing heavily in our infrastructure to ensure that we can continue to provide the seamless experience our users have come to expect.","1697":"Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our iPhone sales performance. [SEP] The iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we've measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6. [SEP] However, we anticipate strong demand for our upcoming iPhone 7 launch in the second half of this fiscal year.","1698":"We are committed to integrating our various services and channels to enhance our customers' experience and make Amazon the premier destination for grocery shopping. [SEP] As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. [SEP] This integration will allow us to offer our customers a wider range of options, greater convenience, and even faster delivery times. We know our customers value quality products and exceptional service, and we are excited to bring the best of Amazon and Whole Foods together to deliver that experience.","1699":"I'd now like to turn to our community initiatives and highlight some recent successes. [SEP] And so I'll share just one example but one I really love, which is the Alameda County Fair, which is a local fairground in Pleasanton, California. [SEP] Through our partnership with the fair, we were able to provide free admission and transportation for over 1,000 underserved families in the area, allowing them to enjoy all the festivities without financial burden.","1700":"We've seen some fierce competition in the market, particularly from some of the newer entrants. Our sales team has been working around the clock to try and secure our position. [SEP] And so I think it's product first, and then prices sort of falls out of that, and we did decide to be more aggressive. [SEP] Of course, being more aggressive with prices is a risk. However, we believe that it's a calculated risk that we need to take if we're going to stay ahead of the competition. We'll be monitoring the situation closely, and we're prepared to adjust if necessary.","1701":"We have seen an increase in demand from our customers over the past few months. [SEP] Yes, order size can go up, but we ship a lot of toys and bigger items. [SEP] Our fulfillment centers have been able to handle the larger items with ease, but we are constantly monitoring our processes to ensure efficient shipping.","1702":"Can you comment on the potential impact of the current market volatility on your business? [SEP] And of course, as I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve never worried about that. [SEP] We believe in the resilience of our business model and remain confident in our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders.","1703":"We have had a very successful quarter and are excited to announce our latest commercial deal. [SEP] I\u2019m not going to comment on any specific dollar terms, it is the largest commercial deal that we\u2019ve signed of the size and we see -- we\u2019ve line of sight to many more such deals. [SEP] We are confident that this deal will help us continue to grow and expand our business in the coming years.","1704":"We have seen a decrease in smartphone sales in the United States over the past quarter. This can largely be attributed to the recent changes in carrier subsidies for smartphones. [SEP] The subsidy, the lack of that \u2013 and this is more of a U.S. phenomenon than the rest of the world, some of that can be a shock for people that were used to paying $199 for their smartphone. [SEP] However, we have also seen an increase in sales of mid-range smartphones as consumers look for more affordable options. Moving forward, we will continue to monitor the market trends and adjust our strategy accordingly.","1705":"Our team has been hard at work developing new tools and technologies to enhance productivity and collaboration. [SEP] I think if we can really change the way people work, I think the opportunity is enormous. [SEP] As we look forward, our focus will be on expanding our reach and increasing adoption among businesses of all sizes.","1706":"When it comes to our financing program, we're finding that more and more customers are opting to trade in their old devices in order to lower the monthly cost of their new iPhone. [SEP] And the residual value for iPhone tends to be the highest in the industry and many people pick up $300, $350 or so for their iPhone and so that even reduces the monthly payment less. [SEP] We believe this is a testament to the high quality and durability of our products, and we will continue to prioritize the sustainability of our devices and their value for our customers.","1707":"Now moving on to our advertising strategies for the quarter. [SEP] So on that, I think what we're continuing to see with Stories monetization is, that is a product that's experiencing a lot of impression growth. [SEP] We have also seen an increase in ad revenue generated from Stories as more advertisers are recognizing its potential.","1708":"As we continue to integrate our latest acquisition with our existing technology, we are excited about the potential for further growth and innovation. Our team has been working diligently to identify the key synergies between these two products. [SEP] We think we're at the very beginning of what's possible when we combine these two. [SEP] In the coming months, we will be rolling out several new features that will further enhance the user experience and provide even greater value to our customers. We believe that our unique combination of capabilities has the potential to transform the industry and we are committed to staying at the forefront of this innovation.","1709":"Our company's financial performance has been impacted by various factors in the past few quarters. [SEP] And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4 and it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market. [SEP] We are confident that our product strategy, marketing initiatives, and investments in R&D will pay off in the long run. \n\n\"And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4 and it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market. We have already taken steps to address the issue and are closely monitoring the market conditions. Our goal is to ensure that our customers have access to high-quality products at competitive prices. We are committed to delivering value to our shareholders and are optimistic about the future prospects of our business.","1710":"Our company's focus this quarter has been on building a strong foundation for our platform.\"\n- \"As part of our strategy, we have invested heavily in fostering a thriving ecosystem. [SEP] We think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem. [SEP] We've seen tremendous growth and engagement from our partners and users as a result.\"\n- \"Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize the health of our ecosystem in our decision-making to ensure long-term success.","1711":"We have received quite a few questions from investors regarding our key performance indicators for bookings. [SEP] But I do think the more helpful KPI for us in terms of bookings is the commercial one. [SEP] Our commercial bookings include contracts with higher average order values and longer-term commitments, so it gives us a better understanding of the health of our business.","1712":"We've been talking a lot about our long-term goals and vision for the company, and I wanted to take a moment to dive a little deeper into our plans for ecosystem development. This is an area that we see as critical to our success in the coming years, and I'm excited about the progress we've already made. [SEP] So the work that we started talking about at F8 that we are releasing slowly over the course of the year is certainly one of the precursors for building out that ecosystem that I'm excited about. [SEP] Of course, there's a lot of work still to be done, and we know that building out a robust ecosystem takes time and effort. But I'm confident that we have the talent, resources, and vision needed to make it happen. As we continue to release new products and features throughout the year, we'll be keeping a close eye on user feedback and making adjustments as needed to ensure that we're delivering the best possible experience. Thank you all for your continued support and engagement.","1713":"We are proud to announce that our company has doubled its investment in outsourced labor from India. [SEP] And there's a lot of research that we've seen and reports that third parties have put out that show, that when you connect to place like India, it makes a very big difference socially and for the economy there. [SEP] As a company, we are committed to not only achieving financial success but also making a positive impact on the communities in which we operate. By increasing our partnership with Indian companies, we are contributing to the growth and development of the country's economy.","1714":"Our financial results for the quarter were quite positive overall. [SEP] It was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than was in our guidance. [SEP] We believe this was due to unexpected expenses that arose during the quarter, and we are taking steps to address them going forward.","1715":"We continue to innovate and experiment with our products across all our platforms. [SEP] You can see that a little bit in the announcement and launch of Instagram Stories and what we're doing with Messenger and some of the additional tests on Facebook and the camera work that we're doing in WhatsApp. [SEP] Our focus remains on developing engaging experiences for our users that drive growth for our business.","1716":"We've been reviewing our customer feedback and analyzing our operations to identify ways we can enhance the overall customer experience. Our goal is to make sure we're meeting and exceeding customer expectations in every aspect of our business. [SEP] Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. [SEP] In addition to improving selection and delivery, we're also investing in technology to streamline the ordering process and reduce wait times. We're confident that these efforts will result in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty going forward.","1717":"Our revenue from mobile advertising has been steadily increasing. [SEP] But now between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which are two very broad communication networks, we're pretty confident that because of the higher quality of calling that you can get through the services that we're providing that this is going to continue growing very quickly. [SEP] We're also exploring ways to improve the user experience and engagement on these platforms through new features and integrations.","1718":"I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, who will give an update on our recent performance and outlook for the future. [SEP] In terms of monetizing some of our newer attempts at products in News Feed such as Ad Break, those are really in early experimental stages, and for now, we're really focused primarily on our core business, our core ad products, of which video is one. [SEP] However, we recognize the potential in these new areas and will continue to invest in them. We believe that over time, they could provide additional sources of revenue for our business. We will keep you updated on any developments in these areas.","1719":"Our goal for the next year is to expand our product line and enter new markets. [SEP] As you've seen from our track record during the last five years, we will do it at a very fast pace but we also want to do it efficiently. [SEP] To achieve this, we will be investing in new technology and hiring additional staff to support our growth.","1720":"We have seen a decrease in our server maintenance costs this quarter. [SEP] It's rather a reflection of the work that we've done to make our server capacity last longer. [SEP] This not only benefits our company financially, but it also creates a better user experience for our customers.","1721":"As part of our expansion plans, we have been looking into ways to optimize our supply chain. [SEP] We thought it made sense to go ahead and buy some trailers, we're actually still contracting out for the truck part. [SEP] However, with the increased demand for our products, we have noticed that our current logistics process may not be sustainable in the long run.","1722":"Our Q2 results exceeded expectations and we are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum moving forward. [SEP] That starts in Q3, but there's a number of other factors that I also pointed to, including the desktop lapping some of the efforts we made on desktop in terms of unblocking or working against the ad blocking technologies. [SEP] Therefore, we expect to see continued revenue growth in the coming quarters, especially as our desktop advertising efforts gain traction and ad blocking becomes less of a hindrance.","1723":"We've seen a decrease in overall sales as a result of the recent economic downturn. [SEP] And you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously that doesn't help us. [SEP] We're working on implementing strategies to increase our national marketing efforts to counteract the negative effects on local demand.","1724":"So, can you talk a little bit more about how this new feature has impacted user behavior? [SEP] At the time, what I basically said was, that even though this might decrease time spent and we expected that it would, is we took out especially a bunch of watching of viral videos. [SEP] But we also anticipated that users would find new ways to engage with the platform and we're seeing that with increased time spent on user-generated content and conversations in the comments section.","1725":"Moving on to our advertising strategy, I'd like to focus on our local initiatives. [SEP] On local, we think this is a really big opportunity, and you see this in the large base of existing businesses using Facebook and Instagram increasingly. [SEP] In addition, we are continually improving our tools and resources for local businesses to help them better leverage our platform.","1726":"Can you talk more about the investments you're making in your logistics and transportation capabilities?\"\nPossible [SEP] It's obviously transportation where you're building out new transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries. Possible [SEP] sentence: \"How do you see these investments affecting your bottom line in the long term?","1727":"Now, turning to our financial performance for the first quarter. [SEP] So when you put things in perspective and you add the $10 billion of growth that we had in the first quarter and the $7 billion to $9 billion that we're guiding to for the second quarter, you're talking about $17 billion to $19 billion of growth in six months. [SEP] We're really proud of these results and remain confident in our ability to continue delivering growth for our shareholders.","1728":"We've seen some challenges in using third-party data to target our ads. Firstly, with the changes to third-party cookie tracking, it's becoming increasingly difficult to attribute meaningful results to our advertising efforts. [SEP] Secondly, mobile operating systems and browser providers such as Apple and Google have announced product changes and future plans that will limit our ability to use those signals. [SEP] As a result, we've been shifting our focus towards building our first-party data capabilities, which will allow us to better understand our customers and target them more effectively. We're also exploring new channels and methods for reaching our audience, such as influencer marketing and contextual advertising.","1729":"We have developed a new product that we are excited to release to the market. [SEP] It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. [SEP] However, there are features and capabilities that differentiate it from a traditional phone and we believe will make it a game changer in our industry.","1730":"We've seen a lot of growth in our e-commerce business over the last several quarters. [SEP] So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers. [SEP] We're also working on improving the customer experience on our website and mobile app, with a focus on personalization and ease of use. Additionally, we're exploring new marketing channels to reach a broader audience and drive more traffic to our site. Overall, we're optimistic about the future of our e-commerce business and believe we're well-positioned for continued growth.","1731":"One of the key performance indicators that we've been closely tracking is daily active users or DAUs. [SEP] We're not providing a specific time spent update but I think it paints the picture well on the DAU front. [SEP] Our DAU numbers have exceeded our expectations and have continued to grow steadily quarter over quarter, which is a positive sign for the long-term health of the company.","1732":"Our advertising revenue increased by 25% compared to the same quarter last year,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] and the willingness of advertisers continue to grow budgets with us I think highlights our progress there. [SEP] We are confident that our strong relationships with advertisers and our innovative ad targeting technologies will continue to drive growth in the coming quarters,\" added the CFO.","1733":"Our investments in the Indian market continue to yield impressive results. [SEP] We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. [SEP] With these efforts, we have seen a 50% increase in customer loyalty and are on track to exceed our revenue targets for this quarter.","1734":"As we continue to innovate and expand our platform, we remain committed to making sure it is accessible to everyone. [SEP] That allows us to not only do things around accessibility, to show somebody who is visually impaired to be able to read to them what might be in a video or a photo. [SEP] We believe it\u2019s important to create a more inclusive environment where everyone can participate and engage with our content.","1735":"We are now going to discuss our cloud services. [SEP] because our cloud, our public cloud runs on our software assets, our software asset gets packaged up as our servers. [SEP] This integration allows us to seamlessly deliver updates and upgrades to our cloud services without any disruption to the customer.","1736":"We recognize that the current economic climate has been challenging for our customers, and we wanted to find ways to make sure that our products and services remain accessible to everyone. [SEP] Not only did we lower the prices of our products but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. [SEP] We're pleased to report that these initiatives have been successful, as we've seen an increase in both sales and customer satisfaction. By offering more affordable options, we're able to help our customers save money and stay loyal to our brand.","1737":"Can you provide some information on the geographic distribution of your current operations? [SEP] We're in four countries right now, the U.S., UK, Germany and Japan. [SEP] Are there any plans to expand into other countries in the near future?\" \"How do you plan to navigate any potential challenges with entering new international markets?","1738":"Can you provide more detail on the start-up costs for this project? [SEP] Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. [SEP] We anticipate that the start-up costs will level out in the second half of the year as we ramp up production.","1739":"Thank you for your question. Our team is excited to share updates on our progress. [SEP] On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 cities across eight countries. [SEP] We continue to see strong demand for the service and are investing in expanding our capabilities to meet customer needs.","1740":"We have seen strong sales of both our Mac computer line and iPhone product line this quarter. [SEP] There is probably some level of cannibalization that's going on with the Mac on one side and the Phone on the other. [SEP] However, we believe that the overall effect of these two products on our company's profitability is positive, as they appeal to different segments of the market and provide unique value propositions.","1741":"Now, let me give you some examples of how our advertising strategies are working in practice. [SEP] I'll share one example of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook through ads, which is a company called Sparkle in Pink. [SEP] Since we started working with Sparkle in Pink, they\u2019ve seen a 20% increase in sales and their customer base has grown by 30%.","1742":"Our advertising business continues to be a key driver of our revenue growth. [SEP] Because we are looking to show relevant ads to the right person at the right time, the systems we have that understand in a privacy-protected way what ads people are likely to be more interested in, those work, whether you're in Stories or Watch or Instagram Feed or News Feed. [SEP] In fact, we recently made updates to our algorithms to improve the relevance and personalization of ads for our users.","1743":"We've seen a significant increase in our user base in recent months due to the popularity of our free offerings. [SEP] And obviously in - finally in getting more people that are enjoying things for free to - let to pay for some of the premium services. [SEP] Our goal is to continue providing high-quality free content while also offering value-added features to those willing to pay for them.","1744":"We've received a lot of questions about why we've decided to prioritize mid-roll ads over pre-roll ads on Facebook. [SEP] In terms of why mid-roll is preferable to pre-roll, Facebook is well suited for shorter-form content where we're ranking things to be longer-form as well. [SEP] Additionally, mid-roll ads allow for a more seamless viewing experience for users, as they don't have to endure an ad before getting to the content they want to see.","1745":"We have seen a significant increase in our user base across all platforms over the past quarter. [SEP] But ultimately, I think that humans have such a deep desire to express themselves and want to connect with the people around them that I think that all of these audiences and all of these different types of media should grow over time. [SEP] Our company is focused on improving user experience and providing innovative tools for self-expression to meet this growing demand.","1746":"We've been investing heavily in technology to enhance our customer experience. As part of that effort, we've been experimenting with new ways to streamline the buying process and make it easier for customers to get what they want quickly. [SEP] We also have in the same vein of, I think what you called maybe automated consumption, the same day has expanded. [SEP] One of the initiatives we're particularly excited about is our same-day delivery service. We've been working to expand this offering to more locations, and we're pleased to report that we've seen significant traction in recent months. As more and more customers look for fast, convenient shopping options, we believe same-day delivery will be a key driver of growth for our business.","1747":"During the last quarter, we saw a significant increase in the number of businesses creating interactive messaging experiences through our Messenger platform. [SEP] If you're a business and you have a higher ROI for interacting with a person in your messaging thread than you do on the mobile web or trying to get them to install an app, then that creates this positive feedback loop, where you're going to point your ads towards the Messenger thread. [SEP] In addition to businesses seeing higher ROI, we've also seen a notable increase in user engagement with businesses through Messenger, which is a testament to the power of personalized and convenient messaging experiences.","1748":"We are very excited about the growth we are seeing in international markets, particularly China. Our iPad sales have been particularly strong in this market, and we believe there is still plenty of room for growth. [SEP] But if you look at iPad as just an example, in China, 68% of the people that purchased an iPad it was the first tablet they've owned and 40% of those have never owned any Apple product. [SEP] This is a testament to the appeal of the iPad as a versatile and user-friendly device, as well as the strength of our brand in China. We are confident that we can continue to capture market share in this important region and build on the momentum we have established.","1749":"We've been focusing a lot on improving the user experience of our platform. [SEP] So it's a different consumer format, and we believe that the ad format should follow the consumer format, so it's really integrated as part of the experience. [SEP] Our data shows that when ads are seamlessly integrated into the consumer experience, engagement and conversion rates significantly increase.","1750":"We had a strong Q3 and are excited to share our results with you today. [SEP] And so for us I think really the way to think about the early signs of the impact were the strong device mix, some higher priced units across a wide variety of OEMs as we build into holiday, did provide some slightly better than expected results, as you noted in the non-Pro business. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the holiday season and are working hard to continue this positive momentum.","1751":"I'd like to highlight our investments in our infrastructure to support our growing shipping volumes. As we continue to see increased demand for our services, we recognized the need to expand our capacity. [SEP] Last year we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went into service in the back end of last year. [SEP] While we are pleased with the progress we have made in expanding our capacity, we remain committed to optimizing our operations to ensure we are able to meet the needs of our customers. We will continue to make investments in our infrastructure as needed to support our ongoing growth.","1752":"We have seen significant growth in our messaging platforms, and we believe that this trend will continue. [SEP] Messenger, I think, is a really important thing and WhatsApp over a three- to five-year period, and we're investing a lot in it. [SEP] Our goal is to make these platforms the go-to communication tools for people all around the world, and we are committed to enhancing their features and capabilities to achieve this.","1753":"We would now like to turn our attention to our performance in emerging markets over the past quarter.

[SEP] On the Audience Network, we continue to invest in ad tech, and the Audience Network is a key part of our focus there. [SEP] We're constantly working to improve the user experience on the Audience Network, and we've recently implemented a new algorithm that's shown promising results in increasing engagement.","1755":"We've been running a variety of ad campaigns across multiple platforms over the last few months. [SEP] What matters the most is the A\/B test that these people saw ads on Facebook and Instagram, these people didn't, and here's the sales lift. [SEP] Based on our analysis, we believe that Facebook and Instagram achieved the most success in terms of driving sales for our business.","1756":"Our video sharing platform has seen significant growth over the past quarter. [SEP] That's because you can shoot it on your mobile device, you can upload it, you can do that for free or you can pay us for the ad. [SEP] We've also introduced new features that allow for seamless integration with popular social media platforms.","1757":"We have some questions from the participants in the call. [SEP] And, Lloyd, on the margin question, as I mentioned, 2019 will be a big investment year. [SEP] However, we expect these investments to drive long-term growth and profitability for the company.","1758":"Now, turning to our product updates and innovations over the past quarter. [SEP] And on Live video, the theme that I think is most important is just that there's so much that people want to express and share with the people around them that they don't have the tools to do today. [SEP] That's why we're investing heavily in improving our Live video capabilities and creating new features to make it easier for our users to connect and share their experiences.","1759":"Our e-commerce sales continue to rise, accounting for over 50% of our total sales this quarter. [SEP] So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. [SEP] We're confident that these investments in our supply chain will allow us to meet the growing demand of our customers and continue to drive significant revenue growth in the upcoming quarters.","1760":"We recognize that there have been concerns about the impact of content moderation on our ad business. [SEP] Over the next several years as we develop an understanding of all of the content on Facebook that won\u2019t be a constraint anymore. [SEP] We are confident that by continuing to invest in our content moderation efforts while also providing advertisers with more transparent and effective tools, we will be able to maintain strong growth in our ad revenue.","1761":"We recognize that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company. [SEP] and we take this very seriously, from the work we've done with LinkedIn to get CS&E Lean In circles all over college campuses, to encourage more women and under-represented minorities to come into our field. [SEP] In addition, we are committed to improving our hiring practices to ensure that we are attracting a diverse pool of candidates and providing equal opportunities for all.","1762":"Now let's move on to our revenue breakdown by region. [SEP] Obviously, I'm very pleased with the strength of North American ad revenue and, overall, all the different regions, but that's a factor there, and IG is, obviously, contributing nicely to growth in North America and worldwide. [SEP] We are also encouraged by the growth we are seeing in our international markets, particularly in Europe and Asia. We believe there is still significant room for expansion in these regions and we will continue to aggressively pursue opportunities there.","1763":"Now, let's take a look at the breakdown of our revenue streams.

[SEP] We not only see Windows Server obviously but we see 20%-plus of Linux growth. [SEP] As we continue to expand our partnerships and offerings in the cloud space, we anticipate continued growth in both Windows Server and Linux.","1767":"During the past quarter, we conducted market research to better understand our customer base. We discovered that our customer base fell into two distinct groups. [SEP] And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick service restaurant purchasers. [SEP] To cater to these two groups, we will be launching two separate marketing campaigns. The first campaign will target our loyal customers, offering them exclusive deals and discounts. The second campaign will target the quick service restaurant purchasers, highlighting our affordable prices and fast service. We believe that these campaigns will help us expand our customer base and increase our revenue.","1768":"I want to highlight some of our success stories in driving adoption of our solutions. [SEP] But again take all the other things I described, power BI , Dell and the list goes on, take eDiscovery; even for the largest of enterprise these were things that had low penetration or low deployment. [SEP] We have made significant progress in expanding our reach and increasing our market share in these areas.","1769":"Now let's move on to discuss our financial strategy and how we've allocated our resources. [SEP] Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. [SEP] We believe this approach has been beneficial for both our shareholders and the long-term success of the company.","1770":"Our focus continues to be helping advertisers succeed in this ever-changing landscape. We recognize the importance of investing in tools and resources to support our clients, particularly in a time where many have had to pivot their marketing strategies. [SEP] So as we have to help advertisers move, we've learned how to make those investments in making the formats really easy, the measurement really easy, the buying really easy. [SEP] Overall, we've seen positive results from these efforts and have received great feedback from our clients. We believe that by streamlining the advertising process, we can help our clients achieve their goals more efficiently and effectively.

[SEP] We'll be looking for ways to streamline our processes and increase efficiency to help us achieve that goal.","1772":"Let's now turn to our performance by product segment. Overall, we had a strong quarter with growth in all of our business segments. However, there were a few standout areas that I want to highlight. [SEP] The first one was the benefit that we saw from hybrid, in particular, with an outsized impact on Windows Server. [SEP] The second area of strength was our cloud offerings, with continued adoption of Azure and a significant increase in usage of our SaaS applications. Finally, we also saw growth in our gaming segment, driven by strong sales of our Xbox hardware and continued engagement with our gaming community.","1773":"During this quarter, we saw an increase in our cost of goods sold due to higher material and labor expenses. However, we also had a decrease in our server maintenance costs. [SEP] Overall, when you think about COGS and the pacing, the depreciation rates of our servers don't change.

Moving forward, we will continue to focus on optimizing our supply chain to further reduce costs and improve margins.","1774":"Now, if we turn to our collaboration business and Teams in particular, our results were once again very strong in Q4 and throughout the fiscal year.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we continue to see a significant opportunity for Teams to drive even greater collaboration and productivity gains for our customers.","1775":"We have received some questions around our messaging platform and how we plan to monetize it. [SEP] I mean in terms of the focus on privacy, the one thing that I would \u2013 I would sort of cite there, if anything the priority for messaging is clear, the focus on privacy and interoperability, and that means that monetization for messaging is a lower, near-term priority so that has some \u2013 has some impact on the outlook. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to drive revenue growth through other areas of our business and believe that prioritizing privacy and interoperability in our messaging platform will ultimately lead to long-term success. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for monetization in the messaging space, but for now, our focus remains on delivering a quality user experience.","1776":"Our focus for the upcoming quarter is to deliver even more transparency to our advertising partners [SEP] We're very interested in making sure that marketers can verify or measure outcomes through third-parties [SEP] and we are actively exploring ways to partner with reliable third-party measurement companies to achieve this goal.","1777":"We have a question from an investor on how we\u2019ve decided to display some of our new product features on our homepage. [SEP] So many years ago when the homepage ticker was in vogue, we never did that. [SEP] Now, we\u2019re always looking for ways to optimize user experience and engagement, which is why we\u2019ve implemented new features such as personalized content recommendations.","1778":"We have had great success in expanding our product offering and reaching new customer segments. [SEP] So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course there are opportunities. [SEP] However, we need to ensure we have the resources and talent to execute on these opportunities, and we will be investing in those areas as needed.","1779":"Our Q2 results showed a deceleration in revenue growth compared to previous quarters. [SEP] So, just broadly, I think we expect the revenue deceleration trend that Q2 is not mark a reversal of that, but we expect to kind of return to constant currency revenue growth deceleration as you get into the remainder of 2019. [SEP] While we anticipate continued revenue growth, we recognize there may be external factors beyond our control that could impact our performance.","1780":"Can you give us an update on the number of businesses and advertisers using Facebook? [SEP] We've done \u2013 obviously, we have 80 million now pages, so we have 80 million businesses using Facebook on a monthly basis, of which 6 million are advertisers.

We remain committed to achieving our long-term goals and continuing to deliver value to our shareholders.","1785":"We've had a number of questions about the status of our upgrade plans for the upcoming year, so I wanted to take a moment to address those concerns. [SEP] From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. [SEP] On the one hand, upgrading our technology can lead to increased efficiency and improved performance. But on the other hand, upgrades can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and potentially frustrating our customers. So we're taking a careful, measured approach to determine the best course of action for our business.","1786":"During the last quarter, we experienced some challenges in our international markets due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. [SEP] One of the things that we've done to respond to the foreign exchange situation has been to increase the price of some of our products in certain international markets. [SEP] However, we have also been implementing cost-saving measures to offset the impact of the currency fluctuations.","1787":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve the user experience on our platform. Our focus is on keeping our users engaged and creating a seamless experience for them.

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for users to discover and engage with video content on Facebook.","1788":"Our company is expanding rapidly and we're looking to capitalize on the market opportunity. [SEP] But given the growth we have in the business, given the opportunity we have before us, we're very much in investment mode in terms of the infrastructure.

[SEP] So, there's a polarization of tends to be a polarization to early shipping -- or excuse me early purchase and late purchases. [SEP] It seems that many of our customers either want to get their hands on our products as soon as possible, or they're waiting until the last minute to make a decision.","1802":"We received great feedback from customers on our Dash Buttons during the quarter. [SEP] So on the Dash Buttons, we're really excited about what we're delivering there.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate these changes.","1804":"We have seen tremendous growth in our mobile app install ads segment over the past quarter. Our revenue in this area increased by 50% compared to the same quarter last year.

It's called \"Explore\" and it's designed to help users discover new content and discover new communities. [SEP] The reason why it needs to be a different tab or at least a different service from News Feed is because people come to it with a different intent. [SEP] We've received feedback from users that they want a separate space to explore their interests without being bombarded by other types of content. We believe that Explore will help to satisfy that demand and keep our users engaged on our platform.","1808":"We've seen some challenging times in the past year, but I'm pleased to report that our company has performed exceptionally well in the current market.

Our customers have told us that they value fast and convenient delivery options, and we've been working hard to meet that need.

Our sales force has also expanded significantly. R&D spending has also increased as we continue to invest in new products and services.

Our customers trust our brands, and we've continued to expand both the range of products we offer, as well as the number of categories we compete in. [SEP] When you look at private brands, it's very much meant to supplement that great selection, and we look for ways to be able to find private label items that have a high-caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers and really supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing the customers in many cases. [SEP] And to be clear, we don't see this as a zero-sum game. We're not looking to replace vendor or seller products with our own private brands. That's not what this is about.

[SEP] Our research indicates that there is a growing demand for our product in those regions, and we're confident that we can capitalize on this opportunity.","1857":"We've had a lot of questions from investors and analysts about our company's preparedness for GDPR.

[SEP] We believe that by complying with GDPR, we are not only protecting our customers' data but also contributing to a more streamlined regulatory environment.","1858":"Now turning to our advertising strategy. Our focus has been on maximizing revenue from our Stories feature. This has been a strong driver of growth for us in recent quarters. [SEP] So while I do expect that we'll bring more advertisers to Stories and we'll bring more advertising formats to Stories and that will create more demand for Stories, we're also growing Stories inventory quickly.

[SEP] We've increased our marketing efforts in these regions to reach new potential customers and drive adoption of our products.","1866":"We've been seeing strong demand for our services across all geographies and industries. [SEP] So, even though obviously it comes at a little lower gross margin percentage, our ability to add workloads, add premium services and to increase our overall footprint inside a customer is really where the life time value goes up.

[SEP] We anticipate continued demand for our servers with enhanced security features as cybersecurity concerns continue to increase across industries.","1871":"We have decided to focus our resources on improving our desktop website rather than investing heavily in mobile apps. This decision was based on data showing that our desktop site has significantly higher user engagement and conversion rates than our mobile apps. [SEP] because most people don't use the mobile web and mobile apps are expensive to build and hard to get people to use, especially if you're a small business. [SEP] However, we recognize that mobile usage is still important and we will continue to optimize our mobile website for a better user experience. We also plan to explore new technologies and partnerships to make mobile app development more accessible and cost-effective for small businesses in the future.","1872":"We're excited to launch our new feature, Facebook Marketplace, which allows users to buy and sell items within their local community.

We believe that these changes will ultimately lead to a better user experience and a more engaged and active user base. [SEP] There's a lot of different effects that come from the different quality changes and focus on meaningful social interactions, so it's hard to tease out what exactly contributed to the slowdown in user growth. [SEP] However, we did see some negative impacts on our user growth during the quarter, which we attribute in part to the disruptions caused by these changes. We are continuing to analyze the data and monitor user feedback in order to ensure that we are making the right decisions for our users and our business in the long term.","1883":"We've seen a lot of momentum in our e-commerce business particularly with the COVID-19 pandemic.

[SEP] And so overall, I think while it is certainly aided by the large expiry base because it tends to impact the CNB balance the most, it is really I think to your point; it is clearly encouraging because it gives us a very good base of support going into FY 2018 to come in to the GAAP reporting numbers. [SEP] This positive trend has also allowed us to focus on other areas of our business that need improvement.","1916":"We have seen strong demand in some of our higher margin products.

However, we feel confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and emerge even stronger.","1949":"We've seen some interesting trends in our small business division over the past quarter.

[SEP] These changes in customer behavior have resulted in record-breaking sales for our company.","2038":"We have seen some fluctuations in our revenue and operating income due to the current economic climate. [SEP] But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've tried to maintain over time. [SEP] Our goal is to ensure the stability and growth of our company over the long term, and being conservative with our guidance is part of that strategy.","2039":"We continue to see significant growth potential in our platform, but we understand that we need to address some key challenges in order to reach our full potential.

[SEP] We are confident we can sustain this momentum and continue to deliver strong results in the coming quarters.","2055":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith with ABC Investments.

Moving forward, we plan to continue to invest in content and features to drive even more value for our Prime members.","2058":"Our tech team has been working hard to ensure we are able to respond quickly to changes in demand.

I'd like to take a moment now to address a question that has been raised regarding our on-prem component. [SEP] And to your point on the component, the on-prem component, even with comparable doing well, let me break Satya's comment into sort of two drivers that have been actually more sustaining. [SEP] The first driver of sustainability for our on-prem component has been the ongoing investments we've made in innovation.

Our team is ready to assist our clients in adapting to the changing market dynamics and maximizing their IT investments.","2063":"Now I'd like to discuss our financial performance this quarter. [SEP] There's lots of different underlying metrics, but the overall kind of reported metric is really \u2013 continues to be driven by the mix shift away from right-hand column ads, which are lower price and lower value. [SEP] As we continue to focus on delivering more engaging and valuable ad experiences for users, we expect this trend to continue in the near future. \n\nWe've seen strong growth in our mobile ad revenue, which now accounts for over 70% of total ad revenue. While our desktop ads continue to perform well, the growth in mobile ad revenue has been the primary driver of our revenue growth this quarter.\n\nIn addition to the shift away from right-hand column ads, we've also seen an increase in engagement with our video ads, which command a higher price point. This has contributed to a higher overall average ad price and increased revenue per user.\n\nLooking ahead, we're focused on continuing to improve the quality and relevance of our ad offerings, as we believe this will drive increased engagement and revenue growth over the long term. We're excited about the opportunities ahead and remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plan.","2064":"Our team has been working hard on developing new ways to monetize Messenger without sacrificing user experience. We understand the importance of finding the right balance between monetizing the platform and keeping our users happy. [SEP] But we really want to emphasize, especially since there are so many questions on Messenger monetization on this call, that we're going to be slow and deliberate.

[SEP] And then once you have that, the quality of those interactions is really what contributes to the scale of how much you can grow. [SEP] We are also investing in new technology to further enhance the quality of our interactions with customers.","2067":"We saw strong growth in our revenue from online sales during the quarter, driven by increasing demand for our products. [SEP] So that year-over-year growth rate for that line item would have been higher, but for that change. [SEP] However, we expect the impact of that change to be temporary and anticipate seeing continued growth in that line item in the next quarter.","2068":"During the past quarter, we saw strong performance across our product lines.\n- We're pleased to report that our bookings number hit a record high of 18.9.

We've been able to secure some major accounts and partnerships lately. [SEP] It's some of the largest brands in the world really going for the results that they're looking for.

We believe this will be a significant revenue stream for us in the future and will continue to invest in strengthening our partnership with Microsoft.","2072":"During the second quarter earnings call, we would like to update our investors on the performance of our company for the past quarter. [SEP] So back in Q2, I said that we were estimating an $800 million expense tied to One Day in Q2, and we actually were just above that in Q2.

Our focus on streamlining our operations has allowed us to ensure that we have the right inventory in the right place at the right time. [SEP] And our ability to optimize the inventory that we have against those downstream activities allows us to deliver those at still good prices while still seeing effective CPMs go up. [SEP] As we look ahead to the next quarter, we plan to build on this momentum by continuing to refine our inventory management processes. We remain confident that our approach will enable us to deliver strong results for our shareholders over the long term.","2075":"Now I would like to open the floor for questions from our audience.

[SEP] We're pleased with the growth we're seeing in all of these areas, and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results going forward.","2078":"CEO: \"I'd like to take a moment to talk about our cloud business, which continues to be a key driver of growth for us. As you know, we've been deeply invested in cloud technology for years now, and we're starting to see that investment pay off in a big way.\"\n\nCFO: \"Yeah, and one thing I would add to that is the fact that our cloud revenue hit a major milestone last quarter. We are now officially a billion-dollar cloud company, and that's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our entire team. [SEP] You are seeing it even in our intelligent cloud results for the last quarter and this quarter. [SEP] CEO: \"But it's not just about reaching big numbers.

And we're investing heavily in our partner ecosystem to ensure that we can continue delivering value to those customers over the long term.","2079":"We've seen some questions in the chat about our expansion plans and how we prioritize investing in specific regions. [SEP] So there are really two components, and I think Satya has talked about why you would enter a region and its ROI, and there's also the correlation to how many servers and that spend and pace over time based on demand. [SEP] Ultimately, we want to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers while also making sound business decisions.","2080":"One analyst asked for more information on the company's success in the Chinese market.

[SEP] We believe these investments in our infrastructure and expansion will allow us to better serve our customers and continue our strong growth trajectory into the future.","2086":"As we look to the future, we continue to explore ways to drive growth and enhance our capabilities. [SEP] And so one of the opportunities we have here is increasing inventory, and it's particularly good inventory for marketers because we're seeing nice adoption of video views and really nice impact from those sales. [SEP] We believe that leveraging this inventory and our expertise in video will be key drivers of growth in the coming quarters.","2087":"We have received a lot of questions from analysts and investors regarding our approach to state sales tax collection and reporting. We would like to take this opportunity to clarify our strategy and outline our plans for the future. [SEP] So right now, as you mentioned 45 states that have state-imposed sales tax, first-party products we do our own collection on that. [SEP] However, when it comes to third-party products sold through our platform, the responsibility for sales tax collection falls on the individual sellers. We do provide guidance and resources to help them comply with state sales tax laws, but ultimately it is their responsibility to handle the collection and reporting. We believe this approach strikes a balance between fairness for our sellers and compliance with state regulations.","2088":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our holiday products and services in the last quarter. Our team has been working hard to ensure that we are prepared for the holiday season.

[SEP] We anticipate continued growth and are confident that our momentum will carry us into new territories in the coming year.","2091":"We're really excited about the potential for our new video platform. As we mentioned before, we're putting a lot of resources towards developing high-quality video content. We believe this will be a key driver of growth moving forward. [SEP] And then even after we establish a flywheel here and get content being produced for ad revenue share, that's going have a different margin structure than core News Feed. [SEP] Of course, there are still many challenges ahead. We need to make sure we're attracting the right talent and building a loyal audience. And we need to continue to innovate and experiment in order to stay ahead of the curve. But overall, we're confident that our video platform will be a major source of revenue for us in the years to come.","2092":"Today, I'm pleased to report that our company has experienced record-breaking growth over the past quarter.

Can you speak more to the diversification of your product offerings? Have you considered expanding into other operating systems or software solutions?","2098":"In response to an analyst's question about whether the company has seen any changes in user behavior regarding video content on the platform. [SEP] So there, we've really had this dynamic over the last 12 to 18 months where we've limited the amount of video that we've shown in order to make sure - in News Feed, to make sure that it doesn't displace interactions, social interactions that people are having. [SEP] But now, we're starting to see some opportunities to balance that out a bit more and to potentially increase the amount of video that people are seeing in a way that doesn't negatively impact those social interactions.","2099":"Our team has been working tirelessly to innovate and bring new products to market. [SEP] And so I think we're leading and I think we have a lot more to do. [SEP] We have a strong pipeline of projects in development and are excited about the growth opportunities ahead.","2100":"We are seeing strong growth in our advertising revenue, particularly from small businesses. [SEP] And the process for that is often that small businesses become organic users, so those 40 million small business Pages that are using it once a month and then we're able to move them onto being advertisers. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to improve our advertising tools and make them more accessible to small businesses.","2101":"One question we frequently receive is how we plan to monetize our various applications and features. [SEP] We're figuring out the extent to which those should grow to be big, independent apps over time, or should be integrated into the core of the Instagram service or our other messaging apps. [SEP] It's important to note that determining the path forward for these features will take time and be carefully considered to ensure the best outcome for our users and our business. We'll provide updates as decisions are made.","2102":"I'd like to now turn our attention to our database offerings. [SEP] What's happening with SQL Server, SQL Server is no longer just about a database that's on-premise. [SEP] We're seeing a shift towards cloud-based databases and with our Azure platform, customers can now run SQL Server on the cloud and take advantage of its analytical capabilities.","2103":"During the past quarter, we made significant progress in rolling out our new Instant Articles feature on Facebook. This feature allows publishers to share their content directly on our platform, rather than linking to an external website. [SEP] The hypothesis when we rolled it out was that if we removed the latency, which is often 10 seconds to 15 seconds of opening up a web view from News Feed that more people would read news. [SEP] After analyzing the data, we found that the removal of latency did indeed lead to an increase in readership. In fact, articles published through Instant Articles were read 20% more frequently than those accessed through the traditional web view. As a result, we plan to expand this feature to more publishers in the coming months.","2104":"Our company has seen strong growth in recent quarters, driven by strong demand for our products both domestically and internationally. However, there are a few factors that we will need to navigate in the coming months that may impact our earnings. [SEP] As we look forward, and we look into particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 for two main reasons. [SEP] Despite the anticipated headwinds, we have a number of initiatives in place to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our business. We will be closely monitoring the situation and adjusting our approach as needed to ensure that we continue to deliver strong results for our investors.","2105":"Our goal is to continue growing and improving the user experience on Facebook. [SEP] We have introduced a number of things like that for public figures, for groups, messengers, probably been the most successful; it\u2019s something that\u2019s connected to the Facebook experience that now has more than 800 million people using it. [SEP] Additionally, we have been working on enhancing our advertising platform to provide more targeted and relevant ads to our users.","2106":"Our company is continually looking for ways to innovate and improve the user experience. One area we are particularly excited about is our video platform. [SEP] We have a dedicated place for people to watch and comment, where heavily focused on the social aspects of video viewing [SEP] We've seen a significant uptick in engagement since implementing these changes. User feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and we expect even more growth in the coming months.","2107":"As for our social media platform, we continue to see strong growth in user engagement and advertising revenue. In fact, our user base has grown significantly over the past year. [SEP] But I just said earlier that we have more than 900 million people are using that every month. [SEP] This is a testament to the value and relevance our platform continues to bring to people's lives. We will continue to invest in user experience and new features to maintain this momentum going forward.","2108":"We appreciate the opportunity to share our Q2 earnings with you all today. [SEP] The way we think about this is we're trying to help marketers reach their customers, both their existing and their new customers, effectively. [SEP] Our platform provides advanced targeting capabilities to ensure that the right messages are reaching the right people, at the right time.","2109":"We have been closely monitoring the performance of our database solutions across different operating systems. [SEP] Overall, we are very, very excited about what we are seeing with SQL on Linux [SEP] We believe that SQL on Linux will provide our customers with greater flexibility and choice in their IT infrastructure.","2110":"Now turning to our grocery business segment. We've seen a significant shift towards online grocery shopping in the past year due to the pandemic, and we've been actively expanding our offerings and capabilities in this area. [SEP] So, on the grocery side, for fresh we're in a handful of metropolitan areas here in the U.S. [SEP] We're also exploring opportunities to expand our fresh grocery offerings into new markets and regions, both in the U.S. and internationally. Overall, we're confident in the potential for growth in our grocery business, and are committed to continuing to invest in this important area.","2111":"We've been closely monitoring the performance of our loyalty programs and promotional offers. We understand the importance of offering these to attract and retain customers, but we also need to ensure they are profitable for us. [SEP] But what really matters to us and what we look at -- when we look at the elasticity of these programs is to see the impact on our gross margin dollars. [SEP] We've found that some programs have a higher elasticity than others. This means that small changes in the program can have a significant impact on our gross margin dollars. So, we are constantly analyzing and testing different promotions to find the right balance between customer value and profitability.","2112":"We've made significant changes to how we account for certain advertising services that we offer to our clients. These changes were made in order to comply with updated accounting standards and are aimed at providing greater transparency to our stakeholders. [SEP] As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of costs of sales. [SEP] While the adoption of these changes did have an impact on our reported revenue figures, we believe that this is a positive step towards greater clarity and consistency in our financial reporting. Going forward, we will continue to review and refine our accounting practices to ensure that we are in compliance with all relevant regulations and that we are providing accurate, transparent financial information to our investors.","2113":"We were able to make a strategic acquisition last quarter that really paid off for us. It was a unique situation that aligned perfectly with our goals and allowed us to expand into a new market. [SEP] And so it's not part of a broader pattern, or although I wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time. [SEP] However, I want to emphasize that we are not actively seeking out M&A opportunities at this time. Our focus is on organic growth and continuing to improve our existing business operations. But we are always open to exploring strategic opportunities if they arise.","2114":"So, as we look at our overall revenue streams, we continue to see growth in many areas of our business. [SEP] And that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with the strength and diversity of our revenue streams, and we will continue to focus on driving growth in key areas moving forward.","2115":"We have seen a significant increase in our customer base over the last quarter. [SEP] And also just on the growth point, I just think the team that's working on that is executing extremely well. [SEP] Our focus on innovation and strategic partnerships has helped us stay ahead of the competition and continue this growth trajectory.","2116":"As we review our financial performance for the quarter, there are a few key points that I want to highlight. [SEP] Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. [SEP] However, this was largely expected as we continue to integrate the Whole Foods brand into our operations. We remain confident in the long-term benefits this acquisition will bring.","2117":"Our international markets continue to face some challenges, particularly in Latin America. However, we're confident in our long-term growth strategies and are continuing to invest in our overseas operations. [SEP] I mean we saw the impact in places like Brazil, where you\u2019ve gotten in currency headwind of over 30%. [SEP] Despite these currency headwinds, we've still managed to see growth in our Brazilian market thanks to strong demand for our products. We're also exploring ways to mitigate currency risks and optimize our operations in these challenging markets.","2118":"We've been investing heavily in enhancing our online customer experience. As part of that effort, we've been experimenting with new ways to make our website more interactive and engaging. [SEP] And it can be a much more immersive experience and we've already found from the initial experiments that we've done that the engagement is positive and we're starting to roll that out more broadly. [SEP] We're also exploring other ways we can leverage technology to improve customer engagement, including machine learning and virtual reality. Our goal is to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for every customer who interacts with our brand online.","2119":"We have been working on measures to increase customer engagement and loyalty over the last quarter. [SEP] So there'll be an incremental differential in Q1 on those price cuts, but this is something that we again have quite frequently and I don't think it's a large factor in Q1. [SEP] Overall, we remain bullish on our growth prospects going into Q1 and throughout the rest of the year, and we look forward to delivering value to our shareholders and customers alike.","2120":"We are very pleased with the strong growth in our revenue this quarter. [SEP] and that's because I think we solve a really big problem for SMBs, which is how are they going to reach customers. [SEP] Our team has been continually innovating to provide effective solutions for our clients, and we believe this is reflected in our financial results.","2121":"Our quarterly earnings report has shown growth in many areas, but there are some challenges we've faced in the international market. [SEP] And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. [SEP] This appreciation has negatively impacted our profit margins and overall financial performance. We are evaluating strategies to mitigate this impact and remain competitive in our global market.","2122":"We have been working hard to identify areas where we can improve our operational efficiency and reduce costs. [SEP] And as we lower costs, we pass those along to customers, either through new rates or new deals that we have. [SEP] This approach has been well received by our customers and has allowed us to remain competitive in the market.","2123":"Now let's take a look at our performance in China. This is a critical market for us given its size and growth potential. [SEP] In terms of China, the LTE penetration as of the end of last October, which is the last data I've got, was in the mid-20s. [SEP] This is a significant increase from the previous year and we are excited about the growth opportunities in this market. We will continue to invest in expanding our network and improving our offerings to capture even more market share.","2124":"We've seen strong growth in our gaming and productivity segments, but we acknowledge that there is room for improvement in our devices segment. We believe that our upcoming Windows 10 release will be a key driver of growth in this area. [SEP] That's actually a segment we don't today have good devices, and we hope to change that with Windows 10. [SEP] Our team is working hard to develop devices that offer seamless integration with our new operating system, and we're confident that our efforts will pay off. In addition to improving our devices, we're also investing in marketing and sales initiatives to increase awareness and adoption of our products. We're excited for the opportunities ahead and believe that we're well-positioned for success.","2125":"We've had a few ups and downs this quarter, but I don't believe that tells the whole story.\n- Some investors have expressed concern over our recent performance, but I would caution against placing too much focus on short-term results. [SEP] I think that the far bigger thing is to look over a longer period of time. [SEP] As we've seen in the past, fluctuations in the market and our industry can have a significant impact on quarterly earnings.\n- Our growth strategy is designed to create sustainable, long-term value for shareholders, which requires a focus on steady progress rather than immediate gains.","2126":"Now, turning to our financial performance this quarter. [SEP] So we're very happy, very encouraged early on with what we've seen in the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both customers and sellers. [SEP] We believe that the strong momentum we're seeing will continue into the next quarter.","2127":"We are excited to report that our gaming revenue has increased by 20% this quarter. [SEP] But more importantly, we have a much more broader gaming view in terms of what value we can add with our subscription services streaming services across all devices. [SEP] Our team is continuously working on enhancing our offerings and improving user experience to stay ahead of the competition in the gaming industry.","2128":"In terms of our advertising strategy, we\u2019ve been closely monitoring the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, as well as similar regulations being implemented in other regions. [SEP] The number of people who have opted out on using context from the apps and websites they visit for ad targeting has continued to increase since the adoption of GDPR, so we\u2019ve seen that come up both in Europe and around the world. [SEP] As a result, we\u2019ve been exploring alternative ways to personalize our advertising efforts, such as through partnerships with third-party data providers and other innovative approaches.","2129":"We've had a very strong quarter and I am pleased to report our earnings today. [SEP] And so you're seeing \u2013 of course, the auction drives pricing and there has been interplay between the supply growth and the pricing growth, and we're seeing the strong demand play through on the pricing side. [SEP] As we look ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about the market conditions in the upcoming quarter. We continue to monitor supply and demand dynamics closely.","2130":"We're constantly working on new innovations and advancements to provide our customers with the best technology available. Our Cosmos DB has been a key focus area for us, and I think it has the potential to really set us apart in the market. [SEP] I think that, yes, I mean, Cosmos DB's pretty unique capability in combination with everything else we do in both the data layer, the AI layer and the infrastructure layer, I think we have a tremendous opportunity [SEP] Our teams are working hard to continue improving all aspects of our technology stack, and I believe that Cosmos DB will play a large role in our future growth. We're excited to see the impact that it will have on our customers and the industry as a whole.","2131":"Our second quarter financial results were quite phenomenal and reflect the bright future of our company. [SEP] And as you probably know, as I had reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid-June. [SEP] However, despite the challenges with inventory flow, we are proud to report that our overall sales revenue exceeded our expectations and we are optimistic about the future.","2132":"We've had a challenging year, but we remain confident in our ongoing transformation efforts. [SEP] And we do expect material improvement in FY 2017, both from the benefits of scale and the investments we've made, but importantly also in the revenue trajectory we're seeing and the makeup of that revenue. [SEP] Overall, we're optimistic about the direction of our business and the opportunities ahead.","2133":"We have seen tremendous growth and success in our subscription services over the past quarter. [SEP] So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just \u2013 the units do not count in this unit calculation. [SEP] However, we remain committed to investing in and expanding our subscription offerings to drive continued growth and better serve the needs of our customers.","2134":"Thank you for your question. \n- I understand you're interested in our current performance drivers. [SEP] And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3. [SEP] However, we are also seeing some positive contributions from our expansion into emerging markets.\n- As we continue to focus on innovation and customer satisfaction, we expect to see even more growth in the coming quarters.","2135":"In the previous quarter, our AWS business demonstrated strong growth momentum, driven by an increase in usage and a broad expansion of its customer base. [SEP] On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this is primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. [SEP] Looking forward, we anticipate that AWS will continue to play a critical role in our overall growth strategy and remain a key focus area for investment and innovation.","2136":"Our advertising revenue for the quarter showed strong performance, driven largely by our continued investment in our platform. [SEP] We continue to see good growth opportunities across the platform on both Facebook and Instagram and feed and Stories. [SEP] As we look ahead, we remain optimistic about our ability to drive further growth and engagement through a combination of innovative technology and strategic partnerships.","2137":"We're really excited about the growth opportunities we see in our industry. As we've discussed, we plan to invest heavily in technology and marketing to maintain our competitive edge. [SEP] That clearly is going to have implications for margins along with the other big investments that we're making next year. [SEP] However, we believe these investments will pay off in the long run, as they will help us capture greater market share and drive stronger revenue growth.","2138":"Now turning to our retail operations, I am pleased to report that we have achieved strong growth in sales this quarter. [SEP] We\u2019ve taken our brand to more places and we continue to open new retail stores around the world. [SEP] In addition to our physical stores, our e-commerce platform has also seen impressive growth, with a 20% increase in online sales compared to the same period last year.","2139":"We have received a lot of feedback from our users about the importance of privacy and security in their communications on our platforms. [SEP] Right so establishing, we have to rewrite the networks on Messenger and on Instagram to be more client and server oriented to be end-to-end encrypted. [SEP] We believe that these changes will not only improve the security of our users, but also provide a better user experience overall.","2140":"Our focus on providing a unified experience across our portfolio has been a key driver of our success in recent years. [SEP] So, you will see significant synergies in terms of the architectural platform underneath gaming, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn all being the same. [SEP] This alignment not only streamlines our development and operations, but also makes it easier for customers to seamlessly integrate and leverage our products.","2141":"Moving on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] So, you had some G&A expenses that were higher in the quarter as a result of that. [SEP] However, we were able to offset some of those expenses through cost-saving measures in other areas of the business.","2142":"We're seeing unprecedented demand for our products across all regions. [SEP] It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. [SEP] We're working to ramp up production as quickly as possible to meet the needs of our customers.","2143":"We are really excited about the potential of virtual and augmented reality technologies. [SEP] And it will just be an interesting exercise to see how many of the things that we have that are physical things don't actually need to be physical in that world, and how much innovation that opens up for independent developers all around the world. [SEP] Our team is already exploring ways to take advantage of this new landscape and we think it could be a game-changer for our industry.","2144":"We continue to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure. Our investments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are transforming the way we do business. [SEP] You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. [SEP] We are also making progress on our delivery initiatives, including the expansion of our one-day and same-day delivery services. Furthermore, we are exploring new markets for our Amazon Web Services division and are excited about the potential for growth in this area.","2145":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings conference call. [SEP] First, on guidance, we keep it pretty consistent process on how we look at guidance and how we value or how we estimate the near-term view of the business. [SEP] Our guidance takes into account various factors, such as the current market conditions, competitive landscape, and our own internal performance metrics.","2146":"We've had some challenges in the short term with our entry into this new market. [SEP] But I think in the longer term, it's a great move, and I feel really good about how we're doing there. [SEP] Our team has been consistently working on ways to improve our strategies in this market and I believe with time, we will see significant growth and profitability.","2147":"Our advertising revenue increased by 15% this quarter, which exceeded our expectations. We saw strong growth in both display and search advertising. [SEP] But I would say, generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. [SEP] Looking forward, we plan to continue investing in our advertising platform to improve targeting and measurement capabilities. We also anticipate continued growth in mobile advertising as more users access our platform through their smartphones. Overall, we believe that our advertising business remains a key driver of our company's success.","2148":"We've been getting a lot of questions about how the new GDPR regulations might impact our user numbers. [SEP] Finally, on the GDPR trend, that's just based on what we're expecting given that you're having to bring people through these consent flows, and we have been modeling it and expect there would be a flat to down impact on MAU and DAU. [SEP] Of course, we're keeping a close eye on all these trends and will adjust our strategies accordingly.","2149":"I'd like to give an update on our iPhone sales for the first quarter of this year. [SEP] Last year, we launched the top end of our iPhone lineup, which was iPhone X, during Q1 and placed the entirety of the channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. [SEP] This year, we took a slightly different approach with our iPhone launches.","2150":"Our cloud infrastructure was crucial in allowing us to handle the increased traffic and demand we saw over the past quarter. As a result, we exceeded our revenue projections and experienced significant growth in our customer base. [SEP] When someone thinks that only using one cloud, we're definitely one of the names. [SEP] Furthermore, we're constantly striving to improve and innovate our cloud services to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We believe that our commitment to flexibility and scalability sets us apart from our competitors and positions us as a leader in the industry.","2151":"Moving on to our services segment, I am pleased to report that we had another strong quarter with record-breaking results. [SEP] We had double digit services growth in all of the geographic segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services, Apple Pay all set new June quarter records and of course subscriptions have now passed the 300 million, as I'd mentioned before, and so we couldn't be happier with how things are going. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain confident in the growth potential of our services business and are constantly exploring new avenues to further enhance our offerings.","2152":"Can you provide any insights into your growth strategy for the upcoming year? [SEP] And you're right, we do expect to see and continue to do that as we lead into 2017 within the overall envelope I discussed. [SEP] Great, thank you. And can you comment on any potential challenges or headwinds that you may face in the coming year?\"\n\nAnd you're right, we do expect to see and continue to do that as we lead into 2017 within the overall envelope I discussed. As for our growth strategy, we plan to expand our product offerings and enter new markets. However, we do anticipate some potential challenges related to regulatory changes and increased competition. Nonetheless, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate these obstacles and continue driving growth in the coming year.","2153":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith from ABC Investments. \n- Can you provide us with some more insight into your recent financial performance? [SEP] When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last three years, for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. [SEP] As we've mentioned before, we've been focusing on diversifying our product line and expanding our customer base. \n- Going forward, we believe that our strategic initiatives will continue to drive long-term growth for the company, despite any short-term fluctuations in unit sales.","2154":"We understand that there have been challenges for some of our customers in these uncertain times. [SEP] So we'll continue to try to work with folks to try to do what we can to help there. [SEP] Our goal is to support them however we can and ensure that they can continue to rely on our products and services.","2155":"We want to talk about some of the exciting developments we're seeing in our industry. [SEP] For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. [SEP] Our company has been putting a lot of resources into researching and developing edge computing technologies.\"\n\n\"For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. In fact, we believe that edge computing will be the next big thing in technology. This is because edge computing allows for faster processing of data and reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent back and forth to the cloud. As a result, this can lead to improved performance and reduced costs for businesses. Our company has been putting a lot of resources into researching and developing edge computing technologies. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this emerging trend in the industry and drive growth for our company.","2156":"We've seen strong momentum in our video advertising business, with more and more advertisers utilizing this format to reach their target audience. In fact, video ads now represent a significant portion of our overall ad revenue. [SEP] It's worth pointing out that, as Sheryl mentioned, video does displace other ads in News Feed. [SEP] However, we believe that video is a valuable and engaging format that provides a great user experience. We're continuing to invest in this area and exploring new ways to improve the delivery and measurement of video ads on our platform.","2157":"Can you give us some color on how you expect the company's performance to trend for the rest of the year? Are you expecting to see any significant change in consumer behavior or market trends? [SEP] And it should, to your point, match increasingly the market and we do get to some slightly bigger comps in H2 which I would agree with. [SEP] However, I do want to emphasize that we remain cautious about the overall economic environment and the potential impact of ongoing trade tensions. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and make any necessary adjustments to our strategy to ensure we are well-positioned for any potential challenges.","2158":"We believe that the hybrid cloud is the future of enterprise computing. With the proliferation of data and the need for instant access to it, companies need the flexibility to store and process their data both on-premises and in the cloud. [SEP] Most people think about hybrid where they think about the cloud as the edge of their server. [SEP] However, we see the hybrid cloud as much more than just cloud-based storage. In fact, we believe that the cloud can be thought of as the new edge of your server, providing advanced analytics, machine learning, and other capabilities that were once only available on-premises. By leveraging the hybrid cloud, companies can take advantage of these capabilities while still maintaining control over their core data assets.","2159":"We've had a lot of questions around gross margin and how it may trend over time. [SEP] And I would say, the way to think about that and you see it in the gross margin percentages and the improvements we've continued to see is the Azure premium revenue growth exceeding the overall revenue growth that actually is a benefit to the gross margin rate. [SEP] So, we definitely believe the premium mix helps our gross margin because it does carry higher gross margin contribution, and we really see that playing out pretty strongly in Q3.","2160":"We've seen a significant uptick in our marketing spend over the past quarter as we continue to drive awareness and engagement with our brand. [SEP] In the short run, some of the spend is incremental and some isn't. [SEP] However, we believe that the long-term benefits of this investment will outweigh any short-term adjustments to our bottom line.","2161":"In terms of operating profit, we are very pleased with the results this quarter. Our operating profit increased by 30% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also to a lesser extent the stock-based compensation, which certainly hits across all of our businesses. [SEP] We believe that these investments in sales and marketing personnel will continue to drive growth for AWS in the future. As for stock-based compensation, we understand that it can have an impact on our bottom line, but we also believe it is important to attract and retain top talent in our industry.","2162":"Now moving on to our financial performance. [SEP] And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're \u2013 we are accelerating. [SEP] We have seen strong growth in our cloud services, particularly among enterprise customers, and we are continuing to invest in the expansion of our cloud infrastructure to meet their needs.","2163":"We've completed a significant amount of product development over the past few years, but there's still more work to be done. We're going to shift our focus to improving the underlying architecture of our platform. [SEP] So for the next year to two a lot of the work that we need to do is just about getting the architecture right. [SEP] This work may not be as visible as some of our previous updates, but it's critical to the long-term success of our company. It will allow us to scale more efficiently, reduce downtime, and lay the groundwork for future features and capabilities.","2164":"We are pleased to report a strong quarter for our APAC business. Our team has been working hard to expand our presence and deepen our relationships with customers in the region. [SEP] So our APAC business is robust, and I think the global nature of our business is part of driving that. [SEP] Despite some economic headwinds in certain markets, we remain optimistic about our prospects in APAC. We are continuing to invest in the region and have several exciting initiatives in the pipeline.","2165":"Our efforts to enhance user engagement and retention have paid off. [SEP] We got room on user growth, which you continue to see that number go up across segments. [SEP] In addition, we are exploring new markets and expanding our product portfolio to drive further growth.","2166":"Our company's focus on innovation and product development has been instrumental in the success of our latest product launches. [SEP] We also look at the number of people that have upgraded, that were in the installed base prior to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. [SEP] By analyzing customer data and trends, we can better understand their needs and preferences, which allows us to make informed decisions regarding our product offerings.","2167":"Now let's take a look at our gross margin for the quarter. [SEP] So, without it, our gross margin would have been 39.7%. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the results, but we're also looking at ways to further optimize our margins moving forward.","2168":"Thank you for your question about Libra. [SEP] We\u2019ve opened a period of, however, long it takes to address regulators and different experts and constituents questions about this and then figure out what the best way to move forward is and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re planning to do with Libra. [SEP] We understand the importance of working closely with regulators and stakeholders to ensure that Libra is compliant, secure, and meets their expectations.","2169":"Our latest feature, Live, has been a great success for our users and we've been seeing a lot of engagement from our audience. [SEP] We're really excited about it in terms of it providing an authentic and real form of sharing for people, and we're really trying to give people the full range of tools to share what they care about with anyone that they want, and Live is really effective there. [SEP] We'll continue to develop Live and other features that encourage meaningful connections and allow our users to express themselves in new and creative ways.","2170":"Our product development team has been working tirelessly to bring new innovations to the market. [SEP] To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. [SEP] This increased rate of product launches is a testament to their hard work and dedication.","2171":"Our revenue growth for the quarter was driven largely by our advertising platform, which saw significant increases in both the number of advertisers utilizing our services as well as the average spend per advertiser. [SEP] And they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals to \u2013 whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue as we expand our offerings and increase our reach within key target demographics. Our emphasis on targeted advertising and data-driven decision making has proven to be highly effective in driving conversions for our clients, and we look forward to continuing to grow and innovate in this space.","2172":"We've seen strong growth in our third-party services, with an increase in the number of sellers and products on our platform. [SEP] The third-party revenue, it's a positive factor in gross margin and can be a negative factor in fulfillment costs and some of the other metrics [SEP] However, we've also noticed that there's been some inconsistency in how these third-party sellers handle customer support requests, which can impact our overall customer satisfaction metrics.","2173":"Now I want to turn the call over to Wamsi to discuss our financial performance in greater detail. [SEP] If I can add, Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of countries around the world, the reality is that our customers have seen some significant price increases [SEP] However, despite these price increases, we have continued to see strong demand for our products and are confident in our ability to maintain our market share.","2174":"I'd like to now turn our attention to our revenue sources. [SEP] The important thing to understand here is that they're not only used by developers, they're used by all four marketer segments. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a significant increase in adoption of our products by non-technical teams such as sales and customer support.","2175":"Now I'd like to turn to our financial performance in the last quarter. [SEP] CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures, particularly in AWS. [SEP] Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth plans, but we'll also be keeping a keen eye on cost management and efficiency.","2176":"I'd now like to turn our focus to our seller business. [SEP] We spent a tremendous amount of time on our seller business over the years and trying to improve both the experience for sellers, as well as customers.

[SEP] And I think we're going to be receiving, over the next few months, implementation guidance. [SEP] Once we receive this guidance, we will be able to take the necessary steps to stay compliant and continue serving our customers.","2178":"We've seen some short-term fluctuations in our revenue due to market conditions. However, we remain optimistic about the growth potential of our company. [SEP] But again, we're taking a long-term view on the business and interested in helping customers as much as possible in that space. [SEP] That's why we've recently invested in new technologies that will allow us to better serve our customers and stay ahead of the competition in the long run. We believe that this commitment to innovation will pay off and generate sustained success for our shareholders.","2179":"As we continue to navigate these uncertain times... [SEP] The other dynamic in our company though is definitely working on cost reductions and efficiency. [SEP] We have implemented various measures to streamline our operations and reduce expenses without compromising the quality of our products or services.","2180":"We are closely monitoring the proposed changes to the privacy controls on social media platforms. [SEP] But depending on how broadly the controls are adopted and set, there is a potential to impact targeting for our advertisers. [SEP] We are working with our partners to ensure minimal disruption to our advertising campaigns and exploring alternative targeting options.","2181":"We have seen a steady increase in revenue and profits this quarter. [SEP] I think that's very consistent with what we've been talking about over the last several quarters. [SEP] Our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction has been paying off, and we will continue to invest in these areas moving forward.","2182":"We are pleased with the strong growth in user adoption of our devices and services this quarter. Our team has been working hard to provide high-quality products and services that resonate with our customers and meet their evolving needs. [SEP] There are a group of customers who use our devices and then we monetize that in different ways to commitment to Amazon and the video and everything else. [SEP] We're also exploring new ways to deepen our engagement with these customers, whether it's through exclusive content, personalized recommendations, or other features that help them get more value from our ecosystem. Ultimately, our goal is to build long-term relationships with these customers and become their go-to destination for all their entertainment and shopping needs. Thanks for your attention, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.","2183":"We've seen incredible success over the past quarter with our new partnerships in the smartphone industry. [SEP] In fact, I sort of internally think of them as what our relationships with our traditional OEM partners in the PC ecosystem were. [SEP] These new partnerships have allowed us to diversify our revenue streams and expand our reach in the market.","2184":"We had a strong start to the quarter with solid demand and a robust pipeline of new opportunities. [SEP] Now when you launch mid quarter, there's always some timing aspect to that, but I feel very good about the execution of those and that is a meaningful component of that out-performance. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are optimistic about our ability to continue this momentum and deliver strong results for the remainder of the year.","2185":"Moving on to our Prime Day results, we are excited to report that this year's event was another huge success for our company. We saw record-breaking sales and engagement from our customers worldwide. [SEP] We also like that the \u2013 on Prime Day, we were able to expand our list of countries that experience Prime Day; this year to Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

We look forward to expanding our reach even further in the future and bringing the benefits of Prime Day to even more countries across the globe.","2186":"We're excited to share that our new product has received overwhelmingly positive feedback during beta testing. [SEP] And then from there, we'll start to roll it out broadly across the world, hopefully sooner rather than later. [SEP] We anticipate this new product will significantly contribute to our revenue growth in the coming quarters.","2187":"During the quarter, we saw strong revenue growth across all of our business segments despite a challenging economic environment. [SEP] A lot of the concerns that we have with some of the potential changes to the ecosystem we think will disproportionately hurt small businesses' ability to compete with larger companies. [SEP] As a result, we are actively advocating for policy changes that will create a more level playing field for small businesses.","2188":"We've seen a lot of growth in our wearable technology division over the last quarter. [SEP] And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. [SEP] However, we remain committed to innovation and improving our offerings in this area to stay ahead of the competition.","2189":"Our financial performance in the first half of this year has been very impressive. [SEP] And we\u2019re very proud of the fact, when you look, for example, at the last two quarters, the first half of 2015, our revenue growth has been higher than our opex growth. [SEP] This is a testament to the effectiveness of our cost-cutting measures as well as the success of our sales and marketing efforts.","2190":"We've received a lot of questions about our iPhone sales performance, so I wanted to address that in more detail. [SEP] As I talked about it in the comments, the iPhone 6s upgrade rate is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s but lower than the iPhone 6. [SEP] Despite this, we are still seeing strong demand for the iPhone 6s and anticipate it will continue to be a key driver for us in the upcoming quarter.","2191":"We see a lot of potential in the messaging space, and we are actively exploring ways to leverage our platforms to drive growth and engagement. As we look to the future, we are focused on building out our capabilities in messaging and communication, as we believe this is an area of significant opportunity. [SEP] And that is going to be the business that we hope to build on Messenger and WhatsApp over time. [SEP] However, we recognize that there are challenges associated with monetizing these platforms, particularly with regard to user privacy and data protection. We are committed to working closely with regulators and other stakeholders to address these issues and build sustainable, long-term businesses. Ultimately, we believe that our investments in messaging and communication will pay off, both for our shareholders and for our users.","2192":"Our cloud computing division has been a major driver of growth over the past year. [SEP] We\u2019ve seen consistent double-digit billings in this segment and it speaks to that. [SEP] We plan to continue investing in this area to maintain our competitive edge and capitalize on the increasing demand for cloud-based services.","2193":"We are constantly looking for ways to enhance our value proposition to customers [SEP] I think, the announcement I just made about morphing to a one-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail, as we say. [SEP] And we believe that this change will further solidify our position as the go-to destination for all of their shopping needs.","2194":"Our strong financial performance in the last quarter has allowed us to remain committed to our growth strategy despite the current economic uncertainties. [SEP] So, we\u2019re still positioned to invest aggressively both in 2019 and beyond. [SEP] We have identified several key areas for investment, including expanding our digital capabilities and exploring new markets.","2195":"We have seen some challenges in the market over the past few months, but overall our company has remained strong. [SEP] And so that part we really need to protect and we want to continue to invest in the business. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new opportunities for growth and expansion, particularly in the international market.","2196":"Now let's talk about our performance during the holiday season. [SEP] The events we have for Diwali were all in Q4 last year some of them are in Q3 this year based on the timing of the holiday. [SEP] We're excited to see how these events will contribute to our overall Q3 and Q4 sales.","2197":"Our company has recently invested heavily in upgrading our technology and infrastructure. We believe that these upgrades will not only benefit our customers but also improve our operational efficiency and overall bottom line. [SEP] From an absolute quantity point of view, the upgrades for this fiscal year are the highest that we've seen. [SEP] We are already starting to see the positive impact of these upgrades on our revenue and profit margins. However, we recognize that there is still more work to be done in order to remain competitive in our industry, and we will continue to invest in upgrading our systems and processes. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made so far and are confident that these upgrades will position us for long-term success.","2198":"Our partnership with our suppliers has been critical to our success this quarter.

I'm pleased to report that we achieved strong results, exceeding our expectations. [SEP] We hit an all-time record at $9.2 billion, first time we cleared $9 billion.

We remain committed to driving long-term growth and creating value for our shareholders.","2200":"I wanted to touch on our upcoming quarter and provide some perspective on what we expect to see in terms of financial performance. [SEP] Obviously, what is different and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we will have lots of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins. [SEP] However, we anticipate that this will be a short-term impact and we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth in the long-term.","2201":"As we analyze our sales data, we see a clear trend in our revenue streams. [SEP] Much of our, not only our revenue for the quarter, but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year. [SEP] To capitalize on this peak season, we have ramped up our marketing efforts and expanded our inventory to meet the high demand.","2202":"We've been investing heavily into our AI and machine learning capabilities. [SEP] So understanding photos, what's in photos, what's in videos, what people are doing. [SEP] And we're seeing it pay off in our ability to analyze and understand visual data at a more granular level than ever before.","2203":"Our social commerce strategy has been a key focus for us over the past few quarters. [SEP] We started last quarter for buy-on Facebook, and that enables people to buy products from merchants with a buy button on Pages, and it is a product that is used and aimed at SMBs. [SEP] We have seen a significant uptake in adoption of this feature amongst our SMB partners, and we are excited to continue building out new capabilities for them to leverage.","2204":"Moving on to our product strategy for the coming year. [SEP] Devices, we'll continue to invest in as particularly Alexa and the Echo products. [SEP] The success of these devices has been a key growth driver for our company and we believe there is still significant opportunity for expansion in this market.","2205":"Now I'd like to discuss our company's plans for integrating augmented reality technology into our products and services. [SEP] The reason I'm so excited about AR is I view that it amplifies human performance instead of isolates humans. [SEP] I believe that with AR, we can create experiences that enhance our users' abilities and allow them to do more than they ever could before.","2206":"In terms of the iPad, we saw some softness in sales during the last quarter but are optimistic about the future. [SEP] But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad. [SEP] We have some exciting updates and improvements in the pipeline, and we believe the iPad will continue to be a key driver of growth for our company.","2207":"Our latest product launch has been met with a great response from our customers, and we're pleased with the initial sales figures. [SEP] And it's a business that the team is excited about and working hard on. [SEP] We believe that with our continued investment in this area, we can grow our market share and build a strong presence in the industry.","2208":"Looking ahead, we are optimistic about our continued growth and expansion plans.

[SEP] We're quite happy with consumer engagement with 1.3 billion monthly actives on the platform, and we continue to see a lot of organic connections between businesses and consumers on the messaging platform. [SEP] As we expand our features and offerings, we believe this will only further increase consumer engagement on our platform and provide more opportunities for businesses to connect with their customers.","2210":"We have noticed that many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are hesitant to create an online presence. [SEP] But a great majority of those do have a Facebook page, and that's because setting up a web presence for an SMB is complicated and expensive. [SEP] This is why we have developed a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of establishing a web presence for SMBs.","2211":"Our strategy for continued growth involves building deeper connections between our users and the businesses on our platform. [SEP] And then the third phase is once there's good organic interaction between people and those businesses, give those businesses tools that they can pay for to reach more people and amplify those interactions. [SEP] We've already seen success in the first two phases of this strategy with increased engagement and loyalty from our users. We're confident that introducing paid tools for businesses will further enhance the experience for both parties and drive revenue growth for our company.","2212":"And as we continue to develop our platform, we are constantly looking for ways to increase the value we can offer to our users. [SEP] We see that as an opportunity, an opportunity that we can build and we can bring to sellers. [SEP] We believe that this focus on expanding our offerings will help us continue to grow and increase revenue.","2213":"We're now going to take some questions from the analysts on the line. [SEP] One, we made some price adjustments essentially backing out the weaker currency effect and then some. [SEP] Overall, our pricing strategy has been successful in maintaining our profit margins despite the current economic climate.","2214":"One of our key priorities at the moment is to support the growth of our publishing arm. [SEP] Produce publishers, the thing that I'm excited about is, look, I do think that we have a responsibility to help work with newest publishers to fund high quality journalism. [SEP] We believe that by investing in the production of original, high-quality journalism, we can help to build trust with our readers and ultimately drive growth in our audience.","2215":"Now, I'd like to turn to our plans for future growth. [SEP] In terms of autonomous systems, what we've said is that we are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view. [SEP] We believe that investing in this technology will provide significant long-term benefits for our company and our customers.","2216":"We are pleased to announce our quarterly earnings report today. [SEP] The app store hit a new record again last quarter and the growth seems to be really great there. [SEP] Our team is continuing to focus on app store optimization and improving user experience for our customers. We believe this will only further drive growth in the future.","2217":"Our financial performance this quarter has exceeded our expectations. [SEP] We believe the stock is undervalued and so we have a bias towards the buyback. [SEP] However, we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and evaluate other options for utilizing our excess cash.","2218":"We have seen strong growth in our News Feed and video content over the past quarter. [SEP] But I mean, the team has just done really good work in terms of ranking the content and making the experience faster and building out better ways to get feedback from our community on what kinds of content they want to see in News Feed and helping people have the tools that they need to share the social content and news and video content that they want so that way it exists in the corpus of content that can be shown. [SEP] We believe these improvements will lead to continued growth in our user engagement and overall revenue.","2219":"Now I want to talk about our sales performance over the past quarter. [SEP] So I feel great about our sales execution especially in terms of growing the recapture rate at accounts. [SEP] However, there is still room for improvement in terms of expanding our customer base and reaching new markets.","2220":"During the last quarter, we saw significant growth in our operations in that country. We are committed to serving our customers' needs in this market by continuously improving our platform. [SEP] We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. [SEP] Our team is currently working on expanding our product offerings to better cater to the unique needs and preferences of customers in that country. We look forward to seeing continued growth and success in this important market.","2221":"Now turning to our Q3 earnings report, I'm pleased to share that we have exceeded expectations. [SEP] In terms of AR and the Pok\u00e9mon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. [SEP] We've seen a surge in mobile game revenue thanks to the success of Pok\u00e9mon Go and we expect this trend to continue in the coming quarter.","2222":"Now I'd like to turn to our subscription services and give an update on our Prime membership growth. [SEP] Again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth and it has remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year. [SEP] Our focus remains on continuing to add value to the Prime membership and deepening our engagement with our Prime customers.","2223":"We've seen a significant uptick in sales in the last quarter. [SEP] And so these numbers are not numbers that you would get if the market were saturated. [SEP] We believe there is still plenty of room for growth in this market.","2224":"We have noticed a significant increase in online sales during the holiday season. [SEP] As far as, the six days that sort of time period between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday, we don't see an impact on that. [SEP] However, we are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to make adjustments if necessary.","2225":"Our education initiatives have been a key driver of growth for our company over the past few years. [SEP] And we're doing an enormous amount of things to deliver curriculum to both K-12 with Swift Playgrounds in the K-to-6 area, other curriculum as you proceed beyond grade 6 under the Everyone Can Code area. [SEP] We are seeing strong demand for these programs from schools and educational institutions all over the world.","2226":"Our company has made significant technological advancements in the past fiscal year. [SEP] Now today, we don't have to wait for someone to report it a lot of the time. [SEP] This has allowed us to be more proactive in addressing issues and has also improved our overall efficiency.","2227":"Our growth in China was particularly strong this quarter, with revenue up 57% year-over-year. [SEP] So, we're very bullish on it, and I would point out that we're investing in China not for next or the quarter after, or the quarter after, we're investing for the decades ahead and as we look at it our own views is that China will be Apple's top market in the world. [SEP] We're continuing to expand our retail presence in China, opening several new stores over the next year.","2228":"Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO to discuss our financial results for the quarter.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in revenue as we expand our product offerings and reach new markets.","2229":"We've had impressive growth in our Pro segment this quarter. [SEP] The component that actually has impacted -- the second component in Pro that is a quote unquote \u201cASP\/mix comment\u201d is the academic licenses that I referred to earlier where we did lower the price and saw an increased unit number. [SEP] Overall, we're seeing positive trends in our pricing strategy and expect continued growth in our Pro segment.","2230":"We've seen a steady increase in sales in the past quarter. [SEP] So in some ways, I guess you could say it implies slightly better at the company level, if that's how you're thinking about it. [SEP] However, we still need to monitor economic conditions and consumer behavior closely in the upcoming months.","2231":"We've noticed some fluctuations in our Instagram engagement rates across different international markets in recent months. [SEP] And then there's obviously different engagement levels, maturity of Instagram in those markets that also plays into it. [SEP] However, we have implemented new strategies to further boost user engagement and increase adoption in these markets, which we believe will result in sustained growth over the long term.","2232":"Our financial performance this quarter has been exceptional and we are pleased to report strong revenue growth and earnings per share that exceeded expectations. [SEP] And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. [SEP] Going forward, we anticipate increasing hiring efforts in certain areas of the company as we aggressively pursue new growth opportunities. While we remain committed to controlling costs, we understand the importance of having a strong and talented team in place to drive our continued success.","2233":"We're really excited about our recent partnership with Facebook. As we all know, social media advertising has become increasingly important and we believe that we're in a great position to take advantage of it. [SEP] So the fully immersive format with the targeting and optimization of Facebook ads is a pretty unmatched opportunity. [SEP] We've already seen some promising results from our initial campaigns and we look forward to continuing to refine and improve our strategy. Our goal is to provide our clients with the most effective and efficient advertising opportunities possible, and this partnership is a key part of that.","2234":"Our Q1 earnings show that Facebook continues to see solid growth in advertising revenue, particularly on mobile. [SEP] And as people consume more content on Facebook, there's opportunities to show them ads in Feed, so there's an opportunity there, but it's really around engaging with content that you want to find on Facebook. [SEP] Additionally, we're working on new ways to enhance the user experience with personalized recommendations and AI-powered content curation, which we believe will increase user engagement and time spent on the platform.","2235":"We are committed to creating a positive user experience on our platform. [SEP] But if we started playing an ad in the middle of a feed before you got to the video, then that would really go against that. [SEP] We are exploring alternative methods of advertising that won't disrupt the flow of content for our users.","2236":"Can you elaborate on the factors driving the variance between actual and estimated costs for the year? [SEP] So those three areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. [SEP] Are there any specific cost-saving measures that you plan to implement in the coming quarter? And how do you anticipate these initiatives impacting our bottom line?","2237":"One of the highlights for us this quarter was the growth of our user base and the corresponding increase in revenue.

[SEP] We have seen increased engagement from our customers with our subscription services and expect this trend to continue as we explore new offerings.","2238":"We've noticed some fluctuations in our earnings over the past year, and I want to take a moment to address that. While we've seen some growth year-over-year, there have been some dips in certain quarters that may be causing concern among our investors. [SEP] So the way to think about it is over the year, it's up a little and in Q2, it happens to be just a low quarter of the 12 that come up through the cycle, much like Q4 was quite large in the cycle. [SEP] However, it's important to note that these fluctuations are to be expected. We are constantly moving through cycles that can impact our earnings in various ways. Q2 happens to be a low quarter in that cycle, much like Q4 was particularly high.

[SEP] This new business model ensures that our audiences receive authentic and accurate news while supporting the hard work of journalists and publishers.","2242":"Now, I'd like to talk about our advertising revenue. [SEP] And there's a special property with Instagram, which is that the increasing visualization of ads and the creative canvas it offers with the science behind the Facebook targeting and measurement system is really a pretty unusual combination. [SEP] This has led to very strong revenue growth for our company in recent quarters.","2243":"Our team has been working hard to deliver a next-generation 5G network, and we are excited to announce that we are now rolling it out across the country. [SEP] That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone in a way that an older network, a 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. [SEP] This will mean lightning-fast download and upload speeds, ultra-low latency, and a seamless experience for our users, whether they are streaming high-definition video, playing immersive mobile games, or connecting multiple devices to the network at once. We believe that 5G will transform the way we use our smartphones and other devices, and we are thrilled to be at the forefront of this exciting new era in mobile technology.","2244":"During the quarter, we focused on improving our user experience and engagement metrics. [SEP] You're browsing through a News Feed, you tap on a link, if you're not on a good connection, the content isn't cached, it can take 10 or 20 seconds in some cases for that content to load. [SEP] As a result of these efforts, we are pleased to see an increase in user retention and time spent on our platform. \n\n\"Additionally, we have identified slow loading times as one of the biggest pain points for our users. You're browsing through a News Feed, you tap on a link, if you're not on a good connection, the content isn't cached, it can take 10 or 20 seconds in some cases for that content to load. We are committed to addressing this issue and have been implementing new technologies to improve load times and enhance our overall user experience.","2245":"We conducted an internal audit of our compensation practices for the past year and found some concerning trends. There was a noticeable pay gap between male and female employees, particularly in our engineering department. [SEP] If you compared male and female engineers at the same level, there was not this discrepancy. [SEP] However, upon further investigation, we discovered that this disparity was due to a lack of representation of women in higher-level engineering positions. When you compared male and female engineers at the same level, there was not this discrepancy. We are committed to taking steps to address this issue and ensure fair compensation for all of our employees.","2246":"We've been investing heavily in our sales and marketing teams over the past year to drive increased revenue growth. [SEP] And so some of the confidence I think that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense into even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have. [SEP] We're also excited about the growth potential in international markets and are actively expanding our sales presence in key regions.","2247":"We've identified a gap in our customer engagement strategy. It seems like we're not capturing the attention of younger audiences as much as we'd like. [SEP] And that's one where I look at that and I wonder if Facebook can play a role in helping to strengthen that. [SEP] We're open to collaborating with other companies or platforms to improve our engagement with younger audiences. We're also exploring new content formats that could appeal to them. Any thoughts on how we could address this?","2248":"Can you speak to your strategy for the pricing of Prime membership?

[SEP] Overall, we believe that we're well positioned to capitalize on the continued demand for modern devices and the benefits they offer. Our focus for the remainder of the year will be on executing on our strategy, delivering exceptional customer value, and driving growth across our business. We're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.","2250":"In response to a question about competition, the CEO of the company said, \"We believe that we are well-positioned in the market and continue to see growth opportunities. [SEP] The other thing that we see is that with our vast offering of selection and faster and faster shipping programs, we have more competitive offering for many things that they buy. [SEP] Additionally, we are investing heavily in our technology infrastructure to improve the customer experience and make it even easier for them to find and purchase the products they need,\" the CEO added.","2251":"Our sales strategy for the quarter was to focus on promoting our latest product lines.

We continue to see great progress there, especially in terms of capacity. Let's dive in.

[SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the results and believe we're well-positioned for continued growth in the coming quarters.","2327":"Looking ahead to the next fiscal year, we've analyzed our projections and taken into account the current market trends and economic conditions. [SEP] Our current outlook for 2019 does suggests that we\u2019ll see margins come down this year versus 2018. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to manage costs and maintain profitability despite these anticipated margin declines. Our focus will be on increasing revenue through new product offerings and expanding our customer base.","2328":"Our company faced a significant challenge in the past quarter due to the unforeseen spike in the price of raw materials. As a result, our cost structure was affected severely, and we had to reevaluate our strategies to ensure long-term profitability.\n\nStatement: To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. [SEP] To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities [SEP] We invested heavily in research and development and implemented several cost-saving measures to mitigate the impact of the price increase. Fortunately, we were successful in our efforts, and our performance on other commodities exceeded our expectations. We are confident that our focus on cost management will continue to yield positive results in the coming quarters.","2329":"We recognize there have been some challenges in our operations department, specifically in the area of employee turnover. However, we have taken steps to address this issue and have implemented new strategies to improve retention. [SEP] But in general, we're very happy with that team and the progress they're making. [SEP] We believe the efforts we've made will lead to greater stability within the operations team, which should result in improved productivity and efficiency. Overall, we remain optimistic about the direction of the company and our ability to continue driving growth in the coming quarters.","2330":"In response to a question on your approach to third party fees, can you provide some more information on your strategy? [SEP] We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a healthy growth in third party. [SEP] Overall, we believe that creating a fair and mutually beneficial fee structure for third parties is crucial to our success and we will continue to assess and adjust our approach as needed.","2331":"We're constantly working to improve our ad placement and targeting capabilities [SEP] because we think over time our systems will do a better job deciding where your ads should be placed and even helping you target until you\u2019re seeing us build tools in that direction as well. [SEP] We believe this will ultimately lead to better outcomes for your advertising campaigns, and we're committed to investing in this area.","2332":"During the development of our content moderation system, we encountered many challenges. One of the biggest challenges that we faced was identifying and removing inappropriate content while minimizing the risk of false positives. [SEP] And the reason for that is it's much easier to build an AI system that can detect a nipple than it is to determine what is linguistically hate speech. [SEP] We've made significant progress in this area, but there is still a lot of work to be done. We believe that with continued input and feedback from our users, we can further improve our content moderation system and ensure a safe and positive experience for everyone on our platform.","2333":"We\u2019ve seen continued growth in India, where revenue doubled year-over-year. [SEP] We do manufacture some of the entry iPhones in India, and that project has gone well. [SEP] We will continue to explore opportunities to manufacture more products in India to serve the local market.","2334":"We've been seeing some headwinds in our financials in recent quarters, specifically in the second half of this year. We knew that 2020 was going to be tough due to the global pandemic and resulting economic downturn, but we're still feeling the effects. [SEP] But the things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and variable expenses that it takes to run the building and I think that's what Brian's pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting the profitability of the second half. [SEP] However, I do want to highlight some positive developments in our business. Our sales team has been performing exceptionally well, securing new contracts and partnerships with some major players in the market. Additionally, we've been investing heavily in research and development which we anticipate will pay off in the long run. Overall, while we may be facing some near-term challenges, we remain optimistic about the future of our company.","2335":"Now let's take a look at our financial performance for the quarter. I am pleased to report that we had a strong quarter in terms of revenue and earnings growth. Our free cash flow generation was also impressive, which allowed us to continue to return value to our shareholders. [SEP] Even this quarter, we returned almost all of our free cash flow generation in dividends and share repurchase. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We will continue to prioritize investments in our core business and evaluate potential strategic acquisitions. At the same time, we will maintain our commitment to returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","2336":"Our cloud business continued to deliver strong growth this quarter. [SEP] And in fact, a lot of the core Azure technology around machine management and data center management comes out of our bring efforts. [SEP] We believe our investments in Azure will continue to fuel growth in the coming quarters.","2337":"We have had great success with our recent programs aimed at boosting customer engagement and loyalty. These initiatives have resulted in increased sales and improved customer satisfaction ratings. [SEP] We are obviously taking those programs and advocating those more widely and that is at different levels of implementation throughout different geographies. [SEP] In addition to expanding these programs, we are also exploring new ways to leverage technology to enhance our customers' experiences. We believe that technology will play a key role in our future growth and success.","2338":"Now let's turn to our gaming division. [SEP] So on gaming, we feel good about Xbox One X, the premium console launch. [SEP] We've seen a strong response from our customers and expect continued momentum as we head into the holiday season.","2339":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings conference call. [SEP] Plus we're in an environment now that is dramatically different from a macroeconomic point of view than last Q2, from a currency point of view, from the level of which we've had to adjust pricing in several of these markets, and sort pf the overall [Indiscernible] in virtually every country in the world. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain optimistic about our ability to navigate the current market conditions and continue delivering strong financial results. We are confident in the strength of our products and services, as well as the flexibility of our business model, to adapt to evolving market trends and customer preferences. Thank you again for your support and interest in our company.","2340":"Now, I'd like to talk about our recent developments in the area of social media features. [SEP] So, on Stories, we've seen great progress with Stories as a format for people to share on our platforms. [SEP] As of the third quarter of this year, we've seen a 15% increase in Stories usage across all of our platforms.","2341":"We have been exploring various options to diversify our content and offerings for our viewers. [SEP] In terms of working with folks to produce all kinds of content, sports is probably something that we'll want to try at some point. [SEP] However, we currently do not have any concrete plans in place for venturing into sports content production.","2342":"Our virtual reality segment has been a key area of growth for us. [SEP] You\u2019ve got Gear VR and Samsung is really handling all of that from a hardware perspective, and obviously they\u2019re well prepared on that front. [SEP] However, we have been working closely with Samsung to ensure that our software complements their hardware and enhances the user experience.","2343":"We will now review our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] And so versus September of 2014, for example, the U.S. dollar has now strengthened on average against international currencies by about 15%. [SEP] This has had a significant impact on our international sales and revenue.","2344":"We have had a strong quarter and have seen growth across all our key business segments. [SEP] So in many ways your question shows itself in Office, but the trends are the same if you look at EMS growth or if you were to look at that Windows commercial growth number. [SEP] We believe these trends will continue in the coming quarters as we continue to invest in and innovate our products and services.","2345":"We've seen a slight decrease in our subscription numbers over the past quarter. [SEP] I would just say that we don't anticipate that that will be a continuing trend, but given the high penetration rates, we do think they'll be some fluctuation there. [SEP] However, we are actively implementing new strategies to boost retention and acquisition rates in the coming months.","2346":"We have received positive feedback from our customers regarding the improvements in our service delivery. [SEP] So that is certainly a factor that we consider a positive from a customer standpoint and it's one from a cost standpoint that we certainly continue to work on every day. [SEP] Our strategy to reduce costs while improving the quality of our services is aligned with our long-term goals and we remain committed to this approach.","2347":"We've seen continued growth in our mobile advertising revenue. [SEP] It's definitely true that most of our advertisers are advertising on TV and advertising with us on mobile, and they should be. [SEP] We're also seeing an increase in advertisers utilizing our social media platforms for targeted campaigns.","2348":"We've received some questions about our pricing strategy and whether or not we are planning any changes in the near future. [SEP] The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is, price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. [SEP] However, we are always mindful of our profitability and aim to strike a balance between competitive pricing and maintaining our margins.","2349":"Can you elaborate on how contextualizing fits into your overall strategy? [SEP] And on the contextualizing opportunity, the reason I said it's not the primary driver is because of that vast, vast majority of our server business is annuity based. [SEP] That being said, can you discuss any plans or initiatives in place to increase the revenue from contextualizing?\" \n\n\"And on the contextualizing opportunity, the reason I said it's not the primary driver is because of that vast, vast majority of our server business is annuity based. Can you elaborate on how contextualizing fits into your overall strategy? That being said, can you discuss any plans or initiatives in place to increase the revenue from contextualizing?","2350":"Our focus on digital innovation has been a driving force behind our recent success, and it will continue to be a priority moving forward. [SEP] So that's the transformation that you will increasingly see us push forward, and no status quo on any part of Microsoft's organization should be counted on. [SEP] We believe that by pushing the boundaries and embracing change, we can continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders in the years to come.","2351":"We've seen strong momentum in our cloud business, particularly in Azure, and I'm excited to share some insights into our margin outlook. [SEP] I think I have a strong line of sight to AWS's margin profile and still feel good about the progress we're making, not just on the workloads that are relevant, apples to apples with Azure, but also in our broader cloud portfolio and our ability to have very healthy margins across Dynamics 365 as well as Office 365 in conjunction with many of the innovations we're doing across Azure. [SEP] Overall, I believe we are well-positioned to drive profitable growth across our cloud offerings and continue to execute on our strategic priorities. Thank you for your support and interest in our progress.","2352":"One of our key focuses this quarter has been improving the monetization strategy for our platform. [SEP] And as we do better and better on the monetization there, that will support people with higher production costs and doing more premium production and bringing their content to the platform. [SEP] We are already seeing positive results from this strategy, with an increase in revenue from premium content.","2353":"We remain focused on developing AI technologies to enhance our products and services. [SEP] because, as I said, this AI era is mostly first a data era. [SEP] To that end, we have invested heavily in collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data to feed into our algorithms.","2354":"I'd like to turn now to our various business segments and provide an update on our performance. [SEP] So media services, mobile services, WAB which is another place where we actually have lot of traction. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with the growth we have seen across these areas and are confident in our ability to continue to deliver value to our customers.","2355":"Our latest product update has been well-received by our users, especially the ones who are passionate about this specific type of content. [SEP] We're continuing to treat the product to emphasize that kind of content more while building more of these social features. [SEP] As a result, we're seeing increased engagement and loyalty from our core audience, which is a positive sign for our growth trajectory.","2356":"Our strategy for the coming year is focused on creating a more user-centric experience within our platform. [SEP] So that will first take hold as the series of News Feed changes, but over time there are going to be new products that we build new interfaces that the team is designed with the goal of encouraging interactions between people. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe that the more engaging our platform is for users, the better it will perform for our advertisers.","2357":"We received a question about our lack of mobile ad revenue this quarter, and I wanted to address that directly. [SEP] because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if it\u2019s going to be a painful thing for the company. [SEP] However, we are excited to announce that we have found a way to incorporate ads on mobile without compromising on user experience, and we expect to see significant revenue growth in the coming quarters.","2358":"We had a solid quarter overall, with revenue growth in all our business segments. [SEP] I do think we saw some benefit of end of support, but I would not say it was the primary benefit this quarter. [SEP] Our cloud services also saw strong adoption, particularly among our enterprise customers.","2359":"We're thrilled to announce that our revenue for the quarter has surpassed expectations. [SEP] And that's not just for sales, that's also developer community is growing faster than any other country in the world. [SEP] This growth is a testament to the dedication and hard work of our team, as well as the support of our loyal customers.","2360":"We've seen strong growth in our programmatic advertising business this quarter. [SEP] You do have obviously people who are bidding on impressions if they're looking for a brand campaign or a reach campaign, but those aren't necessarily a part of the business that's driving up prices. [SEP] Our focus has been on expanding our programmatic offerings and increasing our efficiency in serving ads to our customers.","2361":"Our revenue growth for the quarter was exceptional, and we continue to lead the market in terms of innovation and customer satisfaction. [SEP] And I think just more broadly, we're seeing continued momentum in enterprise migrations to AWS, and people are moving their workloads to AWS at a faster pace. [SEP] Our partnerships with leading technology companies have also been a key driver of growth, and we remain committed to providing the best possible cloud computing solutions for our customers.","2362":"With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO to discuss our quarterly earnings. [SEP] It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. [SEP] We are excited about the growth opportunities ahead and appreciate our customers' continued loyalty.","2363":"Can you speak to any potential impact from the current political climate on your international business operations? [SEP] So we're happy to do whatever we can to help develop the economies in both of those countries and they're both long-term efforts for us. [SEP] Moving on to our next question...","2364":"One of our main goals this quarter was to increase our paid user base. [SEP] And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double-digits. [SEP] This increase in paid accounts has positively impacted our revenue growth.","2365":"Thank you for your question. In terms of the product launch, we certainly learned a lot from the initial release. It was a valuable learning experience for our team. [SEP] And then the initial version of what we shipped I just think wasn't as high-quality as where it needed to be. [SEP] However, we have since made improvements and we are proud of the progress we have made. Our focus moving forward will be on providing the best possible product to our customers. We are confident in our ability to deliver on that promise.","2366":"Now moving onto our performance in the last quarter. [SEP] There was very strong performance on that front, very strong performance in moving customers to annuity as well as to the cloud. [SEP] We have a solid pipeline for the next quarter and expect to continue this momentum.","2367":"Can you comment on whether or not your company expects to see growth in the coming year? [SEP] We haven\u2019t been in the business long enough to say that with certainty, but that\u2019s what we think. [SEP] Of course, only time will tell and we will closely monitor our performance and adjust accordingly.","2368":"Can you speak more about Facebook's overall advertising strategy? [SEP] Our focus is on bringing people-based marketing and the effectiveness and relevance of Facebook ads off of Facebook so we can give marketers and publishers the tools to reach people across all of their devices. [SEP] How do you plan to measure the success of this effort?\"\n\n\"Our focus is on bringing people-based marketing and the effectiveness and relevance of Facebook ads off of Facebook so we can give marketers and publishers the tools to reach people across all of their devices. We believe this will allow advertisers to create more meaningful connections with their target audiences and will ultimately lead to better business outcomes. As we expand our network and provide more opportunities for cross-device marketing, we will closely monitor engagement and conversion rates to ensure our efforts are driving real value for our partners.","2369":"Now turning to our product performance this quarter. [SEP] The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit swing on channel inventory between the years. [SEP] This swing certainly impacted our revenue figures, but we believe it reflects a more accurate count of our sales.","2370":"Moving on to our Watch platform, I'd like to give an update on some of our recent developments. [SEP] The two big things that we're really focused on now in Watch are, within the Watch tab, also just making sure that the consumption isn't all just passive consumption and making it so that there are more two-way interactions between viewers and the creators and that we can help build community around that [SEP] We believe that by promoting more engagement and interaction, we can drive higher retention rates and ultimately increase revenue through advertising and sponsored content deals.","2371":"We are now opening up the call for questions. [SEP] But if you look at what is secular in terms of growth going forward, it\u2019s data, data management in a variety of new ways. [SEP] Next question, please.","2372":"Thank you for joining us for our Q3 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter with net sales up 37% year-over-year. [SEP] As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on the Amazon site as well. [SEP] In addition to AWS, we continue to see strong growth in our advertising and subscription services. We are confident in our ability to continue innovating and investing in our businesses for the long term. Thank you again for joining us today.","2373":"During the quarter, we continued to invest in our marketing efforts across various channels to reach our target audience and drive sales. We also partnered with some of the leading advertising agencies to create innovative campaigns that resonated with our customers. [SEP] One example is Toyota used Facebook for the launch of the RAV4 Hybrid with Saatchi in Los Angeles. [SEP] The campaign was a huge success, generating significant buzz and excitement among our target demographic. We saw a substantial increase in website traffic, social media engagement, and ultimately, a boost in sales of the RAV4 Hybrid. As we look ahead, we will continue to explore new and creative ways to reach our customers and build our brand presence.","2374":"One question we\u2019ve received from investors is about our capital expenditures and how we manage our investments. [SEP] So that does have some impact on capital intensity and part of the driver, where we\u2019re seeing kind of capital intensity increase over the \u2013 over the past several years. [SEP] However, we are committed to prioritizing projects that bring the highest returns and we continuously reassess our investments to ensure we are using our capital effectively.","2375":"As some of you may know, our company recently experienced some regulatory challenges in certain international markets. [SEP] And so we're working very closely with the appropriate government agencies, and we hope to make books and movies available again to our customers there. [SEP] We remain committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations while also providing our customers with access to a wide range of content.","2376":"We have been closely monitoring our cost structure and have made significant efforts to streamline our operations throughout the year. As a result, we have achieved better cost efficiency and are confident in the sustainability of this trend going forward. [SEP] And we built that not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today. [SEP] We remain committed to creating value for our shareholders and customers through continuous innovation and investments in our core capabilities. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued positive momentum in our performance and are well positioned for future growth opportunities. We thank you for your ongoing support and look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.","2377":"Now let's talk about our efforts to expand our last-mile delivery network and improve customer experience. In the past quarter, we've made significant progress in this area. [SEP] We have delivery from 75 - into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime Now app. [SEP] Our investments in infrastructure and technology have allowed us to meet the increased demand for speedy and reliable delivery during the pandemic. We're confident that we can continue to provide our customers with the same level of service they've come to expect from us.","2378":"We understand that the sales figures for this quarter were not as we had hoped. However, we would like to emphasize that there is more to the story than just the sales numbers. We urge investors to take a closer look at the underlying data. [SEP] If you look at the underlying data, it makes you feel a lot better than the sales do. [SEP] For example, our customer retention rate remains strong, and we have seen a significant increase in website traffic and engagement. Additionally, our cost-cutting measures have resulted in improved profit margins. We remain confident in the long-term health and growth potential of our business.","2379":"Our product pipeline continues to be strong, with a focus on innovation and quality. [SEP] We'll have the Apple Arcade and the Apple TV+ products in the market in the fall and Apple Card will go out in the summer timeframe. [SEP] We believe these new product launches will drive growth and engagement within our ecosystem.","2380":"Our revenue growth has been strong this quarter, driven largely by our Services and Wearables categories. [SEP] We fortunately are strong enough to continue investing and we think it's in Apple's best long-term interest to do so. [SEP] We plan to invest in expanding our retail footprint, developing new products and technologies, and continuing to improve the overall customer experience. We believe these investments will set us up for continued success in the years to come.","2381":"Let's turn our attention to our memory business segment. [SEP] For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, possibly at the end of this year. [SEP] However, we do anticipate continued strong demand in the solid-state drive space.","2382":"We're constantly working on improving the user experience and discovering new ways to engage our audience. We've seen some great success in our recent ventures and we're excited to continue exploring new avenues of growth. [SEP] Once we start getting a bit further along with that, then the next thing that we think is going to be huge is video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create, like the social content that they share on Facebook today, and more professional and premium content both short form and longer form. [SEP] We've also been investing heavily in new technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible on our platform. Overall, we're optimistic about the future and confident in our ability to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing industry.","2383":"Now let me give you an example of the power of online video. [SEP] So for example, in the election, you saw Hillary Clinton announce her candidacy very recently, obviously, and that video got 2.7 million views. [SEP] This demonstrates the reach and influence that online video can have in shaping public opinion and political discourse.","2384":"Now I want to turn to our revenue performance this quarter. [SEP] So I look and say, seeing growth in that number allows us to actually grow the ARPU, and the new services that Satya mentioned continues to let us grow the installed base. [SEP] Overall, we're very optimistic about our ability to continue this growth trend in the coming months and years.","2385":"Our Q1 earnings report reflects tremendous growth in user engagement and advertising revenue. [SEP] One of the things that I would call out in Q1 as a contributing factor on the impression growth side was our decision to rank longer-form video higher in News Feed. [SEP] We believe this decision has not only improved our user experience but also provided value for advertisers looking to reach engaged audiences.","2386":"Our research and development team has been working tirelessly to bring a fresh and innovative approach to our product offerings. [SEP] We're excited about a new surface where businesses can interact with consumers, but also really a new functionality. [SEP] This new surface and functionality will allow us to better meet the needs of our customers and continue to drive growth for our business.","2387":"In terms of our subscription services, Prime continues to be a significant driver of growth. [SEP] But certainly very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, total customer satisfaction. [SEP] We continue to see strong engagement and adoption of Prime membership across all regions.","2388":"Moving on to our Pro segment, which has been a strong performer for us in recent quarters. [SEP] That end of support is about five quarters away, so we'll continue to expect good signal and good demand in that Pro segment. [SEP] However, we are closely monitoring the market for any potential shifts in demand as we approach the end of support date.","2389":"We have seen some promising results with regards to our foray into Story ads. We are optimistic about its potential as a source of revenue for our platform. [SEP] I think, to Ad Breaks in the sense that it's early in terms of using the ads formats in Stories. [SEP] However, we also recognize that we still have much to learn and improve upon with these ad formats. We are committed to continuing to improve the user experience while also delivering value to our advertising partners.","2390":"Our innovation team is working hard to bring new features and services to our customers in record time. [SEP] I would say there's no let-up in the pace of invention here, particularly on the AWS side. [SEP] We believe that our constant dedication to advancing technology and improving our offerings is what sets us apart from our competitors in the market.","2391":"Our team has been working hard to optimize the ad inventory system for maximum efficiency and effectiveness. [SEP] I think it's worth adding that the ad inventory itself is really valuable for marketers and our clients and also works very well with our other ad products [SEP] We have received positive feedback from numerous clients who have seen a significant increase in engagement and conversions using our ad inventory.","2392":"We have been exploring new ways to drive revenue through our mobile platform, and we believe that shopping ads will be a game changer for our business. [SEP] We started testing in Q3 shopping ads, the idea that shoppers can tap on ad, see a product description page and can purchase from the business' mobile site. [SEP] The initial results from our testing have been very promising, with a significant increase in click-through rates and a higher conversion rate compared to traditional display ads. We plan to expand this feature to more markets in the coming quarters, and we're excited to see how it will continue to grow our business.","2393":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for our company, with revenue exceeding expectations and growth in several key areas. However, there are still challenges we are facing in the market. [SEP] We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory pricing environment, which we think is going to start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. [SEP] Our team is working hard to navigate these challenges and capitalize on new opportunities where possible. We anticipate continued progress in our strategic goals and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders. Thank you again for your support and partnership.","2394":"During the Q&A portion of the call, an analyst asked about the company's position in the payment processing industry. [SEP] So, we don\u2019t view ourselves as a payments business, that\u2019s not the type of company that we are. [SEP] Instead,\" the CEO continued, \"we are a technology company that happens to facilitate payments as part of our broader mission to empower individuals and businesses to succeed in the digital age.","2395":"During the past quarter, we have made significant progress towards achieving our key business objectives. We have continued to invest in research and development for new products and services while streamlining our operations. [SEP] We\u2019re also developing some core foundational technologies more in house now than we were in the past. [SEP] This shift towards in-house development has allowed us to increase our intellectual property portfolio and better protect our products and services from potential competitors. We believe that by bringing more of our technology development in-house, we can remain agile and better respond to evolving market needs.","2396":"We realized that our current approach to product development was not serving our customers' changing needs. [SEP] And that\u2019s when we made the shift, not in our business first but in how we develop products. [SEP] By putting our customers' needs and feedback first in the product development process, we were able to create solutions that truly meet their needs and exceed their expectations.","2397":"We are thrilled to share our progress on some of the exciting projects we have in the pipeline. One of these is our new Moments app, which we believe will revolutionize the way people take and share photos on their phones. [SEP] So for example, I talked about earlier, we are building this Moments app, so that way you can take photos on your phone. [SEP] Users will be able to capture their favorite memories and instantly upload them to their social media accounts with just a few clicks. We've already received positive feedback from early testers and expect a strong reception upon its official launch later this year.","2398":"We've had some great successes in the past quarter and we're excited to continue on this path. [SEP] And that is where the product roadmap, whether it's the integration with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, we'll be staying focused on it. [SEP] Our team is fully committed to delivering the best possible solutions for our customers and we're confident that our product roadmap will help us achieve this goal.","2399":"Our cloud services have continued to drive growth and revenue for the company. [SEP] One of the things that I think should be fairly clear is the high correlation between our services in Office 365 as well as Dynamics 365 around data in particular with Azure. [SEP] By leveraging Azure's capabilities, we are able to offer our customers seamless integration and access to their data across all of our platforms.","2400":"We've recently launched a new service that allows for same-day delivery in certain areas. [SEP] So it's still pretty early for a lot of the really expedited delivery options. [SEP] However, we're seeing strong demand for these services and expect to expand them in the coming months.","2401":"Our goal as a company has always been to connect people all around the world, regardless of their location or circumstances. [SEP] You tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately, but you tap on a link, and often it can take 10 seconds to load and if you're on a 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, that could take 30 seconds to load. [SEP] That's why we're committed to optimizing our platform for users in developing countries, where access to high-speed internet may be limited.","2402":"Our strong performance this quarter was largely fueled by the continued growth of our cloud services. [SEP] We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first class and over 20% plus of Azure is Linux workloads, which was sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud which we didn't have previously. [SEP] As we look to the future, we are exploring additional ways to expand our cloud offerings and tap into new markets.","2403":"Now, let's move on to our cloud computing segment and discuss how our Amazon Web Services (AWS) performed this quarter.

We are focused on providing value to our users and advertisers, while also improving the quality and relevance of our platforms. [SEP] So even when we do other things, like we're running tests of payments, we have Marketplace which is growing and doing well, there may be other ways that we could think about making money from those, but in general our strategy is to offer those services at cost and make it so that businesses can bid what it is worth to them to run ads in the system. [SEP] In terms of our advertising business, we see continued strength and demand from both large and small businesses.

[SEP] And so there will be \u2013 there's no doubt in my mind there have already been some large developers that concluded that they could do something on their own. [SEP] But it's also very clear that there's tremendous value in the platforms and I'm confident that the large developers will continue to participate and build on the platforms, even as they have more options available to them. So, I think it's an ongoing evolution, but we feel really good about the progress we're making and the momentum we have.","2483":"We have time for one more question. [SEP] And I think what you're hearing in that answer from Satya, Keith, is really about whether the premium services exist as you heard at the Azure layer, or whether they show themselves in our Productivity and Business Processes segment. [SEP] Thank you for joining us on the call today.","2484":"Can you speak more to how technology has impacted the way your team operates? [SEP] I've always felt that in some sense, most of the time we even automate business processes, but we spend really getting our business done in our communication and collaboration tools. [SEP] So, do you have any plans in place to improve those tools in the near future?\"\n\n\"I've always felt that in some sense, most of the time we even automate business processes, but we spend really getting our business done in our communication and collaboration tools.

Going forward, we'll continue to invest in making our communication tools as seamless and efficient as possible.","2485":"Our revenue has increased with each passing quarter and we attribute this growth to our loyal customer base.

This is why we are focused on building relationships and providing exceptional customer service to ensure our customers continue to come back and spend more with us.","2486":"We're continuing to invest in improving the Messenger experience for our users, and exploring new ways to monetize the platform. Our priorities remain user privacy and experience, so any monetization efforts will be done in a thoughtful and deliberate manner. [SEP] The other way is of course eventually showing paid content in Messenger, whether that's in the inbox or in relevant ways throughout the product. [SEP] We've already begun testing ads in Messenger, and have seen positive results from our early efforts. We're also looking at ways to introduce ecommerce functionality to Messenger, so users can easily make purchases within the app. We believe these monetization efforts will help support ongoing innovation and development of the Messenger platform.","2487":"We've made a lot of progress over the past year in terms of improving our platform and user experience. [SEP] The first and most tactical or just the optimization to everything that you see, right, from ranking in News Feeds, your ranking of ads or search, or improving our security systems, and that's driving a lot of the business and the quality improvement that we're seeing and that's really important.

[SEP] However, we remain optimistic about the future and are confident that our efforts will pay off in the long run.","2494":"Regarding our content partnerships, we are constantly looking for ways to enhance the user experience and provide high-quality content to our users. [SEP] Similarly, we\u2019ve had conversations with makers of Premium Content, I think they\u2019re excited by the work they already do with us to use Facebook to distribute their content and we\u2019re interested and doing more.

This includes investing in search algorithms and user interface design. We believe that improving the content discovery experience will drive even more engagement on our platform.","2496":"Our cloud infrastructure has been a key driver of our strong financial performance this quarter.

[SEP] I'm very optimistic that a lot of this stuff will be able to be supported long term, but you're certainly right that not all of it will be able to be supported by ad models alone. [SEP] However, we have been exploring various other revenue streams such as partnerships, subscriptions, and sponsored content to diversify our income sources and reduce our dependence on ads. We'll continue to experiment and adjust our strategy as necessary to ensure long-term success.","2501":"Moving on to our financial results, we are pleased to report that our revenue for this quarter exceeded expectations. [SEP] And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas. [SEP] We have also made strategic investments in our supply chain and distribution channels in emerging markets to ensure we can meet the demand for our products.","2502":"We have seen strong performance in our lower-ARPU countries in the past quarter. [SEP] So that's really what's driven the difference in ARPUs, and you're also getting faster growth in general in the lower-ARPU countries both within Europe and within APAC.

[SEP] Can you also speak to any future plans for integrating Kiva technology into other areas of your business?","2509":"Now, let's talk about our revenue streams and the corresponding gross margins. [SEP] For example, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue on a net basis and therefore the gross margins tend to be accretive. [SEP] In contrast, on the Google Play Store, we record revenue on a gross basis which results in lower gross margins comparatively.","2510":"Our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction has resulted in strong financial performance this quarter.

[SEP] However, we believe that this is a critical area of growth for our company, and we're confident that these investments will pay off in the long run.","2513":"We've been strategically revamping our advertising approach over the past year. [SEP] Creating shorter ads, creating ads that can work even without sound, more personal ads has really mattered. [SEP] Our data shows that these changes have resulted in a significant increase in engagement and conversions among our target audience.","2514":"During the past quarter, we saw strong growth in our cloud business, driven by a combination of increased demand for our solutions and ongoing investments we have made in our cloud infrastructure. Specifically, our Azure platform continued to outperform our expectations, as we saw significant growth in both our Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings.

[SEP] We have a strong team in place and are excited to see the progress we will make towards these targets.","2518":"Looking at our performance in Q2, we saw significant growth in our messaging platform. [SEP] Through messaging specifically, I'm more optimistic because of the private nature of this space, right? [SEP] We believe there are opportunities to further innovate and improve the user experience within our messaging platform, which could drive even higher engagement and revenue growth.","2519":"Our sales team has been working hard to establish new partnerships and reach out to different segments of the market.

[SEP] But then particularly in the fourth quarter, one of the callouts that we've seen, an increase in third-party promotional free data plans in places like India. [SEP] While these plans have helped drive subscriber growth, they have put pressure on our average revenue per user in the region. \n\n\"But then particularly in the fourth quarter, one of the callouts that we've seen, an increase in third-party promotional free data plans in places like India. While these plans have helped drive subscriber growth, they have put pressure on our average revenue per user in the region.","2522":"Thank you for that question. We'll now move on to the next one. [SEP] So I don't think there's anything specific to ARPU, it's just a reflection of what we're seeing on the revenue front as we scale, and it's sort of as expected there. [SEP] Overall, we're really pleased with our performance this quarter and we believe we're well positioned to continue driving growth in the coming months.","2523":"We understand that these changes might be difficult for some of our vendors and sellers. [SEP] But we're trying to minimize the negative impact on any vendor or seller out there. [SEP] Our goal is to create a transparent and fair marketplace for everyone involved.","2524":"Can you provide some insight on how your new fulfillment network is impacting sales? [SEP] And so the benefit for sellers is they get to take advantage of our multi newer fulfillment network globally, we have a 109 fulfillment centers globally, as well as our customers get to take advantage of that as prime numbers where we offer in those geography. [SEP] Do you have any plans to expand your fulfillment center presence in certain regions?\"\n\n\"Well, we're seeing a significant increase in sales due to our expanded and efficient fulfillment network.

And so, when we look at our customer base, we're seeing a lot of different use cases for cloud services. [SEP] In general, what's interesting I think is you're getting to the crux of it is do we have incremental workloads that are unique to the cloud. [SEP] And as we continue to evolve our cloud offerings, we're looking at ways to differentiate ourselves and provide value to our customers. So, understanding these unique workloads and how we can best support them is a key part of that strategy.","2528":"Thank you for that question, let me address that now. [SEP] If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right, that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year.

It's important to take a broader view when analyzing our performance.","2529":"We've been working on a new feature for the past few months, and I wanted to provide an update on our progress.

Our team is focused on identifying new opportunities and optimizing our current strategies to achieve this goal.","2531":"Thank you for your question about our guidance for the coming year.

[SEP] How do you see this portfolio evolving in the future?","2533":"We've received a lot of questions about our approach to building out our ecosystems, so I wanted to take some time to explain it in more detail. [SEP] So part of our playbook for building out these ecosystems at scale is we start with the person-to-person user base.

[SEP] We are optimistic about our future growth potential as we continue to improve our online shopping experience for our customers.","2549":"Thank you for your question. We are really proud of the progress that we have made over the past year. [SEP] But I completely understand that all of you measure us to what we have done for you lately. [SEP] That's why we are committed to delivering on our promises and continuing to innovate and improve. Thank you again for your support.","2550":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our operating segments and provide an update on our performance there. [SEP] And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth. [SEP] However, we did see some challenges in our European market that impacted overall growth. We're confident in our strategy to address these issues and expect to see improvement in the coming quarters.","2551":"We have had a lot of positive feedback from our customers regarding the value they receive from our products and services. [SEP] So, we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. [SEP] We are constantly looking for new ways to improve our offerings and stay competitive in the market.","2552":"I'd now like to turn to our plans for expansion. [SEP] Of course, in November, we announce we selected New York City and Northern Virginia and between the two cities, we will be investing $5 billion and creating more than 50000 jobs. [SEP] We've received tremendous support from both local governments and communities in these areas and look forward to getting started on this exciting new chapter for our company.","2553":"Thank you for your question. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth in our membership program. As we look to the future, we understand that there may be concerns about saturation and the potential for growth to slow down. [SEP] On your saturation question, keep in mind that even in the U.S., which is our most mature by years of launch, we still grew last year at 47% year-over-year membership growth, and we continue to make the program better and better. [SEP] That being said, we believe there is still significant opportunity for us to expand our membership program both domestically and internationally. We continue to invest in new technology and marketing initiatives to attract and retain members, and we are always looking for ways to enhance the value proposition for our existing members. Ultimately, our goal is to continue delivering strong growth and value to our shareholders.","2554":"Now let's turn our attention to other revenue streams. [SEP] So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex-FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter. [SEP] This growth was primarily driven by the surge in demand for our cloud services and the robust performance of our digital advertising business.","2555":"Another area of our business that continues to perform well is our cloud computing division. [SEP] I'd count Amazon in that category, because on the consumer side of the business, we increasingly see infrastructure savings due to the conversion to AWS resources. [SEP] As we continue to invest in our own technology and infrastructure, we expect to see even more cost savings and efficiency gains in the years ahead.","2556":"We have now reached the Q&A portion of the call, and we will begin taking questions from the analysts on the line. [SEP] Yeah so overall at the highest level, our strategy here is to make sure that the Microsoft Services i.e. cloud services be it Azure, Office 365, CRM Online or Enterprise Mobility suite are covering all the devices out there in the marketplace. [SEP] In Q3, we saw significant growth in our cloud services, with Azure revenue increasing by 50% compared to the previous year. Our focus on covering all devices in the marketplace has really paid off.","2557":"We're now going to take a look at our plans to improve operating efficiency,\" said the CEO during the conference call. [SEP] And secondly, I think it\u2019s a general belief held at the highest levels of the company, that operating efficiency increases our ability to be responsive, both to the needs of our customers, as well as innovate faster inside this place. [SEP] That's why we've invested heavily in automation and streamlined our processes wherever possible,\" the CFO added. \"We're confident that these efforts will lead to even stronger results in the future.","2558":"Our latest product line has been a game changer in the industry. It provides unmatched convenience and control to our customers, allowing them to manage their homes in ways that were once impossible. [SEP] But also can handle request to like home automation to close your garage door, open your door, turn the light on, turn the fireplace on, change the thermostat, all of the things that you would like to do in home automation. [SEP] This level of automation has been a major driver of sales this quarter, as homeowners are eager to take full advantage of the technology we offer. We believe that this trend will only continue as more people see the benefits of a fully connected home, and we intend to stay ahead of the curve with our innovative products and services.","2559":"In terms of our portfolio of businesses, we're really focused on ensuring that they align with our strategic goals. [SEP] And we are constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. [SEP] Of course, we won't pursue any opportunities that don't make financial sense for our company.","2560":"We are confident in our plan to expand our customer base and increase revenue in the coming years,\" the CEO said during the earnings conference call. [SEP] But over the long term and as we continue to move aggressively, we will continue to seek growth dissipate, but I would also say this is going to take longer than I think many people would have thought, there\u2019re lots of users as we continue to redefine what Office is that you add to the base. [SEP] We are investing heavily in research and development to ensure that our products remain cutting-edge and continue to meet the evolving needs of our users,\" the CFO added. \"We believe that this approach will lead to sustained growth for our company.","2561":"We've been closely analyzing the performance of our ad campaigns over the past quarter. [SEP] When people do multiple objectives and video, we're seeing lower cost per click than single image link ads. [SEP] It's clear that incorporating video and multiple objectives in our ads is proving to be a successful strategy for driving engagement and reducing costs.","2562":"Now, let's talk about our financial performance in the last quarter.\"\n2. \"Our revenue grew by 5% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] I would say, though, that we're much more focused on operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars, as we've probably talked about before. [SEP] We're confident that our strategy to increase efficiency and reduce costs will continue to generate positive results.\"\n2. \"Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize profitability and cash flow as key metrics of success for our business.","2563":"When asked about the potential for Instagram monetization, the CEO replied... [SEP] because a lot of public figures and businesses are already investing in creating that kind of good content that goes in Instagram. [SEP] However, we are exploring other opportunities to monetize the platform and increase revenue in the future.","2564":"Can you tell us more about how your new marketplace feature is performing? [SEP] We're starting with people being able to sell things and connect to other people who want to buy them, just like they've been doing in for-sale groups for many years, but we're excited to evolve this and grow it over time as well. [SEP] We see a lot of potential in this area and are committed to providing a seamless and safe experience for both buyers and sellers. In the coming months, we plan to integrate more features to enhance the user experience and drive more sales.","2565":"We've been seeing tremendous growth in our cloud business and we're excited for what's ahead. [SEP] So the first thing is on the infrastructure side itself with the combination of the edge and the cloud I believe between Azure Stack and Azure as well as inclusive of our servers, we have the best crowd platform for what is going to be hybrid computing and we'll continue to push on that, so you'll see growth. [SEP] Additionally, we've been investing heavily in our AI capabilities and I'm confident that this will also contribute to our growth in the coming quarters.","2566":"We have had a strong quarter and are excited about the opportunities ahead for our company. [SEP] One is the one unified developer platform, which I think is perhaps the most strategic piece of Windows 10 along with the unified store. [SEP] The unified developer platform and store will allow for seamless app development and distribution across all Windows 10 devices, providing a better user experience for our customers.","2567":"One of the things that really stands out to us is the continued growth of our mobile advertising business. As we've said before, it's clear that mobile is where people are consuming content and it's where most of our advertising revenue comes from. [SEP] And so what's happening is that people are really using the Facebook business pages and increasingly the Instagram business profile as their mobile presence, and we think that's what's working. [SEP] In fact, we're investing heavily in our mobile advertising capabilities and we believe this will continue to drive growth for our business in the years ahead. We're also exploring new ways to monetize our platforms and offer even more value to our advertisers and users. And with the continued growth of social media and mobile usage around the world, we're optimistic about the opportunities ahead for Facebook and Instagram.","2568":"Thank you for your question. [SEP] I can't forecast into the future on that but I will reiterate the investments we have going on right now which again, we're looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform. [SEP] We believe that investing in the Prime platform will lead to long-term growth and customer satisfaction.","2569":"We've received a lot of questions about our plans for AR\/VR and I wanted to address those today. [SEP] In terms of the monetization question on AR\/VR, we tend to focus first and foremost on customer experience. [SEP] We believe that if we create a high-quality, immersive experience for our customers, monetization opportunities will naturally follow. However, we're still in the early stages of exploring different business models and revenue streams for AR\/VR.","2570":"With the release of our latest product, we've seen a surge in new installations. [SEP] And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base is at such a level, that last quarter we said that we had exceeded 1.3 billion. [SEP] This quarter, we anticipate even stronger growth as we expand into new markets.","2571":"We've had a strong year thus far, but we know there's always room for improvement. [SEP] First is, I think we have exhibited an increasing ability, over the course of the year, to reallocate during the year, both at the organization level and at the team level, to make sure our dollars are going to the highest ROI things. [SEP] This has allowed us to be nimble and respond quickly to changes in the market and in consumer behavior.","2572":"We have seen a lot of uncertainty in the market due to the upcoming U.S. presidential election, and we understand that many of our investors have concerns about how this will affect our company. [SEP] In terms of the election, it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re large and diversified, so no single outcome will have a significant impact on our overall business strategy. [SEP] That being said, we are closely monitoring the election and other geopolitical events to ensure that we are well-prepared for any potential challenges that may arise.","2573":"One of our main focuses this quarter was to expand our operations into emerging markets. [SEP] So it\u2019s a regulatory approval question in India at this point and we had a license to roll it out as part of an initial test, the test went better than we even expected it would. [SEP] However, we hit a roadblock in India as we are currently awaiting regulatory approval for our product.","2574":"Thank you all for joining us today for our quarterly earnings conference call. We are thrilled to share with you the positive results we have achieved this quarter. [SEP] I did -- we are proud of the increase in shareholder return this quarter and importantly we\u2019re focused on how we can continue to do that as a part of our overall long-term shareholder growth. [SEP] One of our key strategies for achieving sustainable shareholder growth is through continued investment in research and development, as we strive to innovate and stay ahead of the curve in our field. We are confident that our commitment to this approach will yield strong results for our shareholders in the years to come.","2575":"As we expand into new markets, we are constantly looking for ways to enhance our customer experience. [SEP] We see great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and migrate to our products. [SEP] And with our new digital platform, we are confident that we can provide even more value to our clients.","2576":"We've seen some impressive growth in our digital advertising revenue this quarter, and that's due in large part to our improved ad strategy. Our team has been focused on making the customer experience as seamless and enjoyable as possible. [SEP] And on advertising, I would say our strategy is to make the customer experience additive by the ad process. [SEP] We're also exploring new ways to personalize the ad experience for each individual customer. We believe this will lead to even greater engagement and ultimately, higher revenue for the company.","2577":"Our cloud services division has seen tremendous growth over the past year as more and more businesses shift their operations to the cloud. Today, we're excited to share some updates on our progress and our plans for the future. [SEP] We have customers using us for true hybrid, if you were deploying for example a SQL server, you can have high availability using Azure that\u2019s a pretty common deployment now using Azure as the backplane for disaster recovery and high availability, that\u2019s for sure is a workload. [SEP] In addition to SQL server, we're also seeing increased adoption for hybrid deployments of other enterprise applications like SAP and Oracle. Our team has been working hard to ensure that our Azure platform can support these complex workloads with the highest levels of performance and reliability. We're confident that as more companies embrace the benefits of hybrid cloud, our position as a leading provider of hybrid solutions will only continue to grow.","2578":"Our international expansion efforts have been a key focus for us this past year. [SEP] We launched on Alipay, for example, in China during the December quarter. [SEP] This has allowed us to tap into a huge market of consumers who prefer to use mobile payment methods.","2579":"Our streaming platform has been performing well this quarter, and we have seen a significant increase in the number of subscribers. We continue to invest in content to provide our customers with a diverse range of choices. [SEP] There may be instances where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad leading into that if it's the first free episode, but generally we like to have that as customers have paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption. [SEP] We also understand that interruptive ads can be frustrating for some viewers, and we are constantly exploring new ways to balance our advertising strategy with a seamless customer experience. Our goal is to always provide the best possible viewing experience for our customers, regardless of whether they are watching a free or paid program. Thank you for your continued support.","2580":"One of the questions we often get asked is how Dynamics 365 differs from traditional CRM or ERP systems. [SEP] The way we designed Dynamics 365, both on the technology front as well as on the business model front was to get away from what I would describe as the old-school suite-based selling or suite-based building of these things, whether it's CRM or ERP or SCM. [SEP] This approach has helped us to eliminate a lot of complexities and costs typically associated with traditional enterprise software systems.","2581":"Our Q2 earnings report shows that we have made significant progress in improving the efficiency of our operations. We have identified areas where we can reduce costs and streamline our processes, and we are already seeing the benefits of these efforts in our financial results. [SEP] I would say that, in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in International segment than it's in North America, it's growing at a same rapid clip year-over-year. [SEP] We are also pleased with the performance of our International segment, where we have been investing in marketing and advertising to raise awareness of our products and services. While our advertising spend is lower in this segment compared to North America, we are seeing strong year-over-year growth in this area. Overall, we believe that our strategic investments in operations and marketing are positioning us for continued success in the marketplace.","2582":"Now let's move on to discussing our product offerings and how they have been performing in the market. [SEP] How we're doing containers for example in Windows Server 2016 we have great container support as well as support for things like our service fabric so that people can have absolute application portability and in fact people can even [indiscernible] applications. [SEP] Overall, we are seeing strong demand for our container solutions and expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","2583":"During the quarter, we saw some exciting brand initiatives across our portfolio. Our marketers have been focusing on creating personalized experiences for our consumers, and we have seen great results from these efforts. [SEP] So for example, Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare did an ad campaign in Germany with ZenithOptimedia, and they defined five distinct cat owner personality types and created different creatives for each group. [SEP] This level of customization has been very effective in driving engagement and purchases, and we plan to continue exploring innovative ways to tailor our messaging to specific audiences. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we have made in our marketing efforts and look forward to building on this momentum in the coming quarters.","2584":"We will now take questions from our analysts and investors on the call. [SEP] On your second question in terms of capital spent, if you think about it at a high level, our capital expenditures are growing at a lower rate than our overall cloud revenue is growing, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting to see leverage, right, flow through the P&L. [SEP] This demonstrates the effectiveness of our capital allocation strategy and our ability to scale efficiently as we continue to grow our cloud business.","2585":"We're focused on delivering a seamless user experience across all platforms, including desktop, mobile and connected devices. [SEP] That's kind of the fundamental table stakes that need to be there and that's the most important thing, and we're really pleased with the 4 billion video views daily that we're getting. [SEP] We continue to invest in new content partnerships and innovative advertising formats to drive even more engagement and revenue growth.","2586":"We've been closely monitoring the emerging trends in the gaming industry.

[SEP] We're very optimistic that we're going to able to launch to everyone in India soon, but of course will share more news when we have that. [SEP] In the meantime, we are continuing to work closely with our partners to ensure a smooth and successful launch.","2588":"We've seen a surge in usage and engagement on our platform over the last quarter, and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our user experience. [SEP] So this is going to be one of the increasing focuses for us or just the different ways that people want to interact and build communities. [SEP] We've recently launched several new features, such as live streaming and gaming, to better cater to our users' needs and interests.","2589":"Our user engagement metrics have been strong, and we're really proud of the progress we've made so far this year. However, we recognize that there is still work to be done to maintain this level of engagement. [SEP] And so we want to make sure we get this right as we focus on continued engagement. [SEP] To that end, we're investing heavily in product development and user research to better understand what our users want and need from our platform. We believe that by listening to our users and delivering compelling new features, we can continue to drive engagement and grow our business.","2590":"Looking at our Q1 results, I want to highlight our commercial performance. [SEP] And if I triangulate between all those three, just like I did in Q4, I feel really good about our commercial performance. [SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to focus on driving growth in our commercial sector and expanding into new markets.","2591":"Our digital advertising revenue has been strong this quarter, with growth in all of our key markets. [SEP] And we think all of these platforms together really help give us the ability to serve our clients in a very leveraged way, and use the targeting and measurement capabilities we have invested in across multiple platforms. [SEP] Additionally, we have seen positive results from our recent investments in programmatic advertising, which has allowed us to optimize our ad placements and provide even greater value to our clients.","2592":"Our partnership with GE has been a strong driver of growth for our company. [SEP] So we are really looking forward to accelerating our business with GE and many others to come. [SEP] We are committed to expanding our relationships with key partners and pursuing new opportunities for innovation in the market.","2593":"During the last quarter, we saw a decrease in sales across all product categories. [SEP] But we did see, certainly saw some additional units as a result of Prime Day. [SEP] However, the increase in units sold during Prime Day helped us exceed our revenue forecast for the quarter.","2594":"During this quarter, we saw an increase in the number of new workloads and customers onboard. We believe this is a result of our efforts to expand our offerings and improve our customer experience. [SEP] Sometimes, when you have new workloads and new customers onboard, they start with in some sense the IaaS and the data more at Blob storage, but then scale to higher layer services like our Cosmos DB or even some of our compute higher-level services like in AI. [SEP] As we continue to develop our services, we expect to attract more customers at the IaaS level as well as at higher layer services like Cosmos DB and AI. We are committed to providing our customers with the tools they need to be successful, and we believe this strategy will help us achieve that goal.","2595":"Can you give us some more detail on the success of the iPhone X?

[SEP] And how important is this collaboration with logistics partners in achieving your growth targets?","2599":"We have made significant progress in optimizing our inventory levels in the past few months. [SEP] I don't expect to see any impact from changing inventory levels through the next quarter. [SEP] However, we will continue to closely monitor our inventory levels and make adjustments as necessary to ensure we are operating efficiently.","2600":"Our focus in this call is to discuss our performance and financial results. As you know, we released our latest operating system, Windows 10, last year. [SEP] Because if you look at Windows 10 we've already talked a lot about all the consumer value. [SEP] But what is equally important is the enterprise value that Windows 10 provides. We have seen significant adoption and interest from corporate clients who appreciate the security and management capabilities of the platform.

We will continue to invest in and expand the benefits of the Prime program to further drive growth and customer satisfaction.","2603":"During the conference call, the company's CFO was discussing how their capital expenditures have changed over the years and what's driving those changes. The conversation had turned to the capital intensity of the business. [SEP] The capital intensity of the business over the last several years had come up, and part of what is driving that are real changes in the business as it relates to our opportunity to deploy capital against things like ads targeting as well as the fact that we\u2019ve seen the user base growth shift to regions like Asia and we\u2019re now building our CapEx to what\u2019s effectively an Asian peak and so that\u2019s a lower ARPU user base. [SEP] Despite these challenges, the company remains optimistic about its prospects for growth. They noted that they've made significant investments in technology and infrastructure in recent years, and they believe that these investments will pay off in the long run. They also pointed out that they're continuing to explore new markets and opportunities to drive revenue growth.","2604":"Analyst: \"Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your capital spending. Are you planning to invest more in capacity going forward?\"\n\nCEO: \"Sure, go ahead with your question. [SEP] And on the question on capacity, \u2013 excuse me, cap \u2013 I'll address it as CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. [SEP] We believe that investing in CapEx and leasing capital equipment is essential to support our growth plans and remain competitive in our industry. We've made significant investments in this area over the past few years, and we plan to continue doing so in the future as well. That being said, we're constantly evaluating our investment strategy and will make adjustments as needed based on changing market conditions. Overall though, I'm very bullish on our business and the potential for continued growth and profitability.","2605":"We've been thinking a lot about the long-term sustainability of our business. [SEP] And that you can gain value without some kind of rev share, and that's why the video ecosystem has grown so quickly even before we rolled out a revenue share. [SEP] We believe that by continuing to invest in our creators and providing them with the tools and resources they need to succeed, we can continue to drive growth in the video ecosystem for years to come.","2606":"Can you comment on how the current trade tensions with China are impacting your business?

[SEP] This has resulted in better user experiences and increased engagement with our content, ultimately driving higher revenues for our company.","2609":"We've had a great quarter and I'm excited to share more about our progress and future plans. As we continue to expand our offerings, we're seeing more demand from customers who want to build out their software capabilities. [SEP] One of the things that we emphasize is it's not about our technology, but it's our ability to transfer that capability to our customer because they're increasingly becoming, whether you're in retail or you're in oil and gas or you're in financial services, every one of them is trying to build their own software capability and we are uniquely capable of doing so. [SEP] In fact, we've recently helped a major retailer completely revamp their e-commerce platform and the results have been outstanding.

[SEP] But we're confident that our company is well-positioned to handle the transition.","2613":"Our overall revenue for the quarter is up 5% from the same quarter last year. [SEP] We're expecting annuity double-digit revenue growth and again it's the transactional weakness that you're seeing overall as well as the very specific geo weakness we saw which I called out earlier. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to drive growth through strategic partnerships and product innovation.","2614":"We have seen significant growth in our Prime membership base over the past year. [SEP] We're not going to update our Prime subscription growth beyond what we said last year at the end of last year, which last year in a year when we raised prices early in 2014. [SEP] However, we remain confident in the strong value proposition of our Prime program and are continuously looking for ways to enhance the benefits for our members.","2615":"As we discuss our fourth quarter earnings, I want to highlight some important factors that impacted our results. [SEP] Also keep in mind that during the holiday season, we have a higher mix of products revenue than we have in other quarters, and that obviously is dilutive to the company -- to the company margin. [SEP] However, we are confident that our strategic investments in marketing and product development will position us for long-term growth. Despite the lower margins during the holiday season, we saw strong overall revenue growth and increased market share. We remain committed to delivering value to our customers and generating sustainable profitability for our shareholders.","2616":"Our overall earnings for the quarter exceeded expectations and we are pleased with the performance of our various product lines.

[SEP] We anticipate continued growth in the Windows Server segment as more companies transition away from outdated server versions.","2617":"Our earnings for this quarter have been positively impacted by the growth and adoption of Apple Pay. We are seeing an increasing number of users and merchants embracing this payment method. [SEP] But I have to tell you that given that we\u2019ve launched in October, I'm actually unbelievably shocked, positively shocked at how many merchants were able to implement Apple Pay in the heart of their holiday season, especially given the challenges and the disruptions in the retail environment as a result of the pandemic. [SEP] We are committed to improving and expanding the capabilities of Apple Pay to make it easier for our users to transact seamlessly and securely. As we continue to innovate and provide value to our customers, we are confident in the continued growth and success of Apple Pay.","2618":"As we continue to expand our business, we have identified the educational sector as a key growth opportunity.\n\n2. Our recent market research shows that there is a growing demand for our products and services in the education sector.\n\n3. Over the past year, we have made strategic investments in building our capabilities to serve educational institutions better. [SEP] We\u2019re also obviously \u2013 stimulated this so that we can be much more effective even in the educational markets worldwide. [SEP] We believe that our products and solutions are well-suited to meet the evolving needs of educators and students around the world.\n\n2. Our team is already working closely with several leading universities and schools to deliver customized solutions that cater to their unique requirements.\n\n3. In the coming months, we plan to further ramp up our efforts in the education sector by increasing our marketing and sales activities and investing in innovative technologies.","2619":"Our financial results this quarter have exceeded our expectations and we are proud to report a 15% increase in earnings compared to the same quarter last year. [SEP] But it's come from sustainable investment and our sales, technical resources, and in the engineering to deliver a differentiated value at the customer. [SEP] We have also taken steps to diversify our portfolio and expand our market reach, which has resulted in new partnerships and product offerings. We remain committed to driving sustainable growth and delivering value to our stakeholders.","2620":"We've received a lot of positive feedback from customers about our data platform. [SEP] Yes, we feel very, very good about the data platform and the portfolio we have, whether it's on the relational side with obviously SQL and now Postgres support. [SEP] We're also excited about the growth opportunities in the non-relational database space with our NoSQL offering.","2621":"Now let's turn our attention to our flagship product, Facebook. As many of you know, this platform continues to be the backbone of our business strategy. [SEP] So in the main Facebook app, we're doing a number of different things. [SEP] We're experimenting with new features like Messenger Rooms and expanding our e-commerce offerings to help businesses sell more products directly on the platform. Overall, we're optimistic about the future of Facebook and believe it will continue to deliver value to our users and shareholders alike.","2622":"Our data analysts have been monitoring the evolution of user behavior on our platform. We've noticed a fascinating shift in the way users engage with content. [SEP] And what I mean by that is that there's this trend where ten years back, most of what you saw and shared online was text, and then we went through a phase where most of it is photos. [SEP] Now, we're observing that videos are becoming the most consumed type of media. This is significant as it has implications for our advertising strategy moving forward. In order to stay relevant, we need to adapt to these trends and offer video ad placements to our clients.","2623":"We've had a strong quarter in terms of revenue growth, but I want to take a moment to discuss our long-term strategy for increased profitability. [SEP] But I think that's probably the way to more appropriately think about over time you expect to see gross margin improvement and operating profit improvement as opposed to focusing on the revenue line. [SEP] To achieve this, we are pursuing cost optimization measures and investing in technology to streamline our operations.","2624":"Our revenue growth has been steady and we have seen a lot of demand for our products. [SEP] I will say that, the majority of it is being put in service in the back-end of the year, just like in the last two years. [SEP] We anticipate another strong year and are confident in the growth potential of our business.","2625":"Our investments in virtual and augmented reality are a key part of our long-term strategy. [SEP] So there we talked about all the things that we're building around VR and AR and the ability to be present with anyone, anywhere. [SEP] We've already seen strong adoption of these technologies in certain industries, such as gaming and healthcare. And we believe that as the hardware becomes more advanced and the software more sophisticated, the potential applications will only continue to grow. Our team is constantly exploring new ideas and experimenting with different use cases, and we're excited to see where this technology will take us in the years to come.","2626":"We have just completed the acquisition of XYZ Company and we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. [SEP] So, there will be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. [SEP] Our teams are already collaborating and strategizing to ensure a smooth transition and maximize the synergies between our businesses.","2627":"We've received some questions about our recent announcement regarding our new payment feature. [SEP] And again, like I said earlier, the point here isn't to charge for payments. [SEP] Our goal is to make it easier for our users to pay each other back for shared expenses.","2628":"We are pleased to report on our progress this quarter.\n2. As we continue to grow our business, we are focusing on expanding our product offerings. [SEP] And to now be able to talk about the full SQL estate one of the other conversations that we are having is not just about SQL but our analytics and advanced analytics with where we've done some very, very compelling work again across Linux and Windows and then of course the cloud. [SEP] Our data science team has been instrumental in developing new models that have increased efficiency and reduced costs.\n2. Moving forward, we plan to continue investing in our analytics capabilities to better serve our customers.","2629":"We have seen significant growth in user acquisition over the past quarter. [SEP] So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. [SEP] This growth in user engagement is a testament to the strength of our platform and the value proposition we offer to our customers.","2630":"I am pleased to report that our company has had a very successful year. [SEP] You can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. [SEP] This is a direct result of our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction.","2631":"Can you provide some insight into why you've decided to shift your focus away from the transactional business? [SEP] I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason other than, the change in my worldview, other than maybe the budget and macro pressure tend to exert itself on that transactional business. [SEP] So, overall, would you say that you're optimistic about the future of the company despite these challenges?","2632":"We've noticed some changes in the market that we need to address. [SEP] I also think the shift we're seeing towards people doing more measurable results, and this is important to understand. [SEP] As a company, we need to adapt and make sure we're providing value to our clients.","2633":"We made the decision to invest in the new product line last quarter. [SEP] And looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call. [SEP] Our sales have increased by 20% since the product launch, and we've received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our customers.","2634":"Now I'd like to discuss our company's strategy for artificial intelligence. [SEP] So the biggest thing that we're focused on with artificial intelligence is building computer services that have better perception than people, so the basic human senses like seeing, hearing, language, core things that we do. [SEP] By achieving better perception, we believe we can unlock new opportunities in areas like medical diagnosis and autonomous driving.","2635":"Now, moving on to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] First of all, it\u2019s a 20% year-over-year growth that we\u2019re guiding at the top end of the range. [SEP] We are very pleased with this result and believe it is a testament to the strength of our product offerings and our team's execution.","2636":"Our products and services have continued to exceed the expectations of our customers, and we're thrilled with the growth we've seen in our customer base. [SEP] There's great customer demand for the value that comes in security and analytics, in meetings, in voice, in collab. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and expand our offerings, we believe that we can further tap into the growing market for secure and integrated communication solutions.","2637":"We have seen strong growth in usage of many of our products and services over the past quarter. [SEP] And so many of these assets, including increased usage of our consumer properties inside our productivity business and Office, do require capital spend. [SEP] However, we believe these investments are necessary in order to continue providing high-quality services to our customers and remain competitive in the marketplace.","2638":"Our latest quarterly financial results demonstrate our sustained growth in revenue and profitability. [SEP] And as we like, we see -- we continue to see that engagement growing. [SEP] This is primarily due to our efforts in enhancing user experience and expanding our product offerings.","2639":"Now, I would like to turn our focus to our revenue growth in Q2, which was quite impressive. [SEP] But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that. [SEP] Additionally, our strong advertising campaigns and promotions during the quarter also contributed to the growth.","2640":"Now let's move on to our services segment. [SEP] As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over the previous quarter. [SEP] This growth was driven by strong demand for our premium service offerings and increased adoption of our software-as-a-service solutions.","2641":"Now, I would like to touch on our preparations for the upcoming implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). [SEP] When you think about GDPR, the Facebook family of apps already applies the core principles in GDPR frame, which are transparency and control and we are building on this to make we\u2019re ready to fully comply by May. [SEP] We understand the importance of safeguarding our users' data and we have dedicated resources to ensure that we are not only compliant with GDPR, but also maintain the trust of our users.","2642":"Now, moving on to our commercial business segment. [SEP] Overall in the commercial business, I think we continue to see gross margin improvement and that is sustainable improvement as opposed to I think what you characterized as some non-recurring things that I have mentioned. [SEP] We are also seeing strong growth in this area with new product launches and expanded distribution channels.","2643":"We are extremely pleased with the strong performance in our key international markets. [SEP] in Brazil and Mainland China more than doubling year-over-year which is 3x to 4x what those markets were doing according to IDC. [SEP] This growth is a testament to the strength of our international team and the strategic investments we've made in these regions.","2644":"We have seen continued growth in our user base, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. [SEP] For things like Instagram and even a lot of what we're doing on Facebook, it's a lot more developed countries. [SEP] However, we are actively working to improve access and adoption in emerging markets through initiatives such as our Free Basics program.","2645":"Our company is committed to being a global leader in creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. [SEP] I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed. [SEP] As we navigate through current economic uncertainties, we remain steadfast in our commitment to promoting diversity and open-mindedness as a key strategy for long-term success.","2646":"As we look ahead to our future plans, I want to highlight a key area where we believe Apple can make a significant impact. [SEP] And I think this area in general and all the things we do for the developer community will be the largest contribution that Apple can make [SEP] This is why we recently launched new programs and resources for developers, to help them bring their ideas to life and reach more users around the world.","2647":"Our expansion into the Indian market has truly paid off this quarter. [SEP] It's a very exciting time in India and again, the invention is off the charts. [SEP] We have high hopes for continued success in this region and plan to invest more resources into it moving forward.","2648":"Our digital advertising revenues continue to increase and we are seeing strong demand from our clients. [SEP] Marketers also really love video and it\u2019s a really compelling way to reach people and video is contributing to our growth. [SEP] We are investing in new technologies and partnerships to enhance our video capabilities and deliver even better results for our advertisers.","2649":"Our overall revenue for the quarter has exceeded expectations, with strong performance in both hardware and services. However, we have noticed some deceleration in certain markets. [SEP] That said, I don't think it\u2019s growing as fast as it was, but I also don't think that Apple's results are largely dependent on minor changes than growth. [SEP] We remain confident in our ability to innovate and provide value to our customers, regardless of short-term market fluctuations. Our upcoming product releases and continued investment in research and development are sure to contribute to sustained growth in the long run.","2650":"Now let's turn to our spending plans for the year. [SEP] I would expect these investments to increase relative to 2018 and we've reflected what we see so far in Q1 in our guidance. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our investments as needed to stay in line with our long-term strategy.","2651":"During the past year, we have seen incredible growth in our Messenger platform, with active user numbers continuing to climb steadily. [SEP] I actually think over the next couple of years or few years, the much bigger driver of the business and determinant of how we do is going to be video, not Messenger. [SEP] However, as we look to the future and consider the changing landscape of consumer behavior, we believe that video content will become the powerhouse of our business, driving engagement and revenue growth in exciting new ways.","2652":"Our company had a strong performance this year, exceeding our expectations. We are proud to announce that we have achieved record-breaking earnings. [SEP] In context, it's $7 billion to $9 billion above last year. [SEP] This increase in earnings can be attributed to our company's focus on innovation and cost-saving measures. We anticipate continued growth in the coming year and look forward to building on this success.","2653":"Our latest earnings report showcases continued growth in our services sector, particularly with the launch of Apple Music. [SEP] I\u2019m really happy with the early days of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music business [SEP] We are dedicated to enhancing the user experience with our music service and will continue investing in this area. We believe the success of Apple Music will have a positive impact on our overall revenue growth.","2654":"Our user engagement metrics continue to impress as we saw a significant increase in both daily active users (DAU) and monthly active users (MAU) this quarter. [SEP] So, really good strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio. [SEP] We attribute this success to our ongoing efforts to improve user experience and offer compelling content, as well as targeted marketing and advertising campaigns.","2655":"We've received a lot of questions about our performance in Greater China during this quarter. [SEP] And if you look at the \u2013 it sounds like you're honing in on the Greater China results themselves. [SEP] Overall, we're very pleased with the growth we're seeing in that region, particularly in our online sales.","2656":"Our third quarter earnings have exceeded our expectations, with strong growth across all of our core businesses. We've seen encouraging signs in the market and emerging opportunities that we plan to capitalize on in the coming year. [SEP] Those are trends I'd expect to see obviously as we look into 2017. [SEP] Our strategic initiatives and investments in innovation will continue to drive growth and enhance our position in the market. We anticipate facing some challenges in the short term, but remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.","2657":"A question was asked about the impact of Windows 10 on enterprise customer adoption. [SEP] But just take security itself, I think that Windows 10 represents a real breakthrough in terms of security on the endpoint as well as in embedded, which we are really excited about in terms of driving the enterprise upgrade cycle. [SEP] We've also seen strong interest in our advanced threat protection solutions, which are increasingly important in today's cybersecurity landscape.","2658":"We have a strong quarter, and we're seeing continued growth in our messaging apps. However, we're also focused on expanding our video capabilities and exploring new opportunities in this area. [SEP] And I think that those questions around video, which I'm optimistic about, but there are real questions there that we need to manage well, is going to be a much bigger driver of the business over the next two to three years likely even than the trajectory of what we're doing on Messenger and WhatsApp. [SEP] We're investing heavily in video technology and content partnerships to build a more immersive user experience. We believe this will enable us to capture a wider audience and increase engagement on our platforms. While there are certainly challenges ahead, we're excited about the potential of video to drive our business forward in the years to come.","2659":"Our team has been working really hard to improve the user experience on our platform. We've made several changes to streamline the checkout process and enhance the overall flow of our service. [SEP] We're getting the highest conversion rates that we've had since the launch of the service. [SEP] This has resulted in a significant increase in sales and revenue for the company. We're confident that these improvements will continue to pay off in the coming quarters as we further refine and optimize the platform.","2660":"In terms of our product development, we have made significant strides in expanding our offerings. [SEP] We've added 800 new services and features so far this year; that's an accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. [SEP] Our goal is to continue to innovate and provide our customers with the latest and greatest tools in their industry.","2661":"Our advertising platform has been gaining popularity among businesses of all sizes. [SEP] They manage those pages and then they can promote those pages via our easy-to-use ad products. [SEP] This has resulted in a significant increase in revenue for us over the past quarter.","2662":"Our company's revenue growth has exceeded our expectations this quarter. [SEP] We are pretty excited to have 1 million advertisers and 8 million Instagram business profiles on the platform. [SEP] This growth in advertisers and business profiles is reflective of our focus on improving our advertising and business tools on Instagram.","2663":"We've been working on some exciting new developments in the realm of personal digital assistants. [SEP] I think to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. [SEP] That's why we're investing heavily into the development of our AI assistant and are committed to making it more accessible and user-friendly.","2664":"Our revenue for the quarter has exceeded our expectations and we are pleased to report a significant increase from the previous year. We have noticed a shift in customer behavior over the past few months and wanted to address any potential impact on our invoicing process. [SEP] There was no change in any way to invoicing people paying earlier, paying more upfront, that\u2019s definitely not an impact on that number. [SEP] However, we have seen a slight decrease in the number of customers choosing to renew their contracts early. This could potentially affect our revenue in the long term, but we are confident that our strong customer relationships and high-quality products will continue to drive growth. We appreciate the support of our shareholders and look forward to another successful quarter.","2665":"We are pleased to report strong earnings for the quarter. Our sales have exceeded expectations and our team has worked hard to optimize our operations. [SEP] For example, our cost structures that we are able to manage throughout the year. [SEP] As a result of our disciplined approach to cost management, we expect to see continued profitability over the next quarter. We are confident in our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and to deliver value to our shareholders.","2666":"We've been exploring different ways to enhance our mobile app experience. [SEP] So there's not really a question of whether that should be a separate app. [SEP] Instead, we're focusing on improving our current app and making it more user-friendly.","2667":"Thank you for joining us on our Q2 earnings call. [SEP] We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. [SEP] Our financial results were driven by strong sales across all regions and product lines, as well as effective cost management strategies. We expect this positive momentum to continue into the second half of the year.","2668":"Now let's move on to user engagement and activity on our platform. [SEP] So overall sharing is up across Facebook, and people are spending more time on Facebook and the whole family of apps. [SEP] We believe this increase in sharing and time spent on our apps will contribute to our continued growth and success moving forward.","2669":"Now let's talk about some of the factors that may impact our earnings in the coming quarter. [SEP] First of all, there's the currency, which is going from being a tailwind to being a modest headwind, we expect. [SEP] We are also keeping a close eye on the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as any further escalation could have a significant impact on our business.","2670":"In response to your question, we are currently in the process of reviewing our legal options regarding that matter. [SEP] I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. [SEP] We will keep our shareholders updated as we move forward with any legal actions.","2671":"Our revenue recognition policy has changed with the implementation of ASC 606. I would like to take a moment to discuss how this has impacted our financial statements. [SEP] When you see longer commitments under 606, you often have more recognition upfront. [SEP] This change has resulted in earlier revenue recognition and improved cash flows for our organization. Furthermore, under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when performance obligations are met, rather than when cash is received. This provides a more accurate representation of our financials and a better understanding of our revenue streams.","2672":"Thank you for the question. I think it's important to clarify how we approach our communication with investors. [SEP] And so therefore, we will, as I said, we'll provide qualitative commentary when it is important and relevant. [SEP] But for the most part, we believe our financial results and metrics speak for themselves and will continue to be our primary mode of communication.","2673":"Can you explain more about why you decided to invest in this data center? [SEP] Because we\u2019re running our public cloud in it and that\u2019s what anyone deploying their own private cloud expects to have. [SEP] We believe this investment will give us a competitive advantage in the market and provide the scalability and reliability our customers demand.","2674":"Can you elaborate more on the decline in revenue for the third quarter? [SEP] The reason we called it out, obviously, because it was such an outlier. [SEP] We want to make sure investors understand that this event was not indicative of our overall performance and we have taken steps to prevent similar occurrences in the future.","2675":"We've had a strong quarter and we're excited to share our guidance with all of you. [SEP] And so we're going to see what happens, but we put our absolutely best thinking that we have here in the guidance that Luca presented, and you can tell from that, that we're bullish. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to closely monitor market trends and adjust our strategy as needed. But right now, we couldn't be more confident in our outlook for the next quarter.","2676":"We are now going to discuss our company's financial performance. [SEP] This is a young and rapidly growing business, and as you've seen looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and continue delivering strong results for our shareholders.","2677":"We have been working hard to attract more people to the platform by introducing new features and services that will increase user engagement and satisfaction. [SEP] Overall, I mean the way that Dating fits into the strategy here is within the Facebook app, we think that News Feed is really central and that it's one of the only things that we think everyone who uses the app is really going to use on a daily basis. [SEP] We believe that by adding the dating feature to our app, we can further add value to the user experience and keep people coming back to the platform regularly.","2678":"We've been investing heavily in understanding the behavior and preferences of our customers. [SEP] In terms of making money on that, once we have that behavior, I think there are going to be a number of ways that we can amplify that. [SEP] This could include offering personalized recommendations or targeted advertising based on their behaviors.","2679":"We're pleased to report that our revenue for this quarter has exceeded expectations. Our success can be attributed to a number of factors, including our strong customer base. [SEP] It's clear that we also have a fantastic alignment of our business model with the interest of our customers. [SEP] We believe that continued alignment with our customers' needs and wants will ensure long-term growth and sustainability. Moving forward, we plan to focus on improving our products and services to better meet the changing demands of the market.","2680":"Our cloud-based subscription services have continued to see strong growth across the board. We are particularly excited about the potential of Office 365 in emerging markets. [SEP] But now you can have a small business in a country like India, buy Office 365 as a subscription service. [SEP] This represents a significant opportunity for us to tap into the rapidly expanding small business market in these regions. We are already seeing strong adoption rates in India and other countries, and we believe this will be a key driver of our growth in the years to come.","2681":"We are really excited about the progress we have made in expanding our ecosystem and providing more value to our users and developers. Our focus on unifying our market place has been a key driver of this growth. [SEP] No one else provides that kind of a unified market place for developers and especially the changes we've made to the desktop user interface means these universal applications are in fact very naturally discoverable right where we have high usage, which is the desktop. [SEP] Furthermore, we continue to see strong adoption of our universal applications and we anticipate this trend to continue in the coming quarters. We are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth and create long-term value for our stakeholders.","2682":"Our company has invested a lot of time and resources in creating new features and products for our users. [SEP] Things like Watch or the News tab that we have started rolling out are not things that we expect everyone to use. [SEP] However, we believe that these features will appeal to certain segments of our user base and help drive user engagement and retention.","2683":"Now, turning our attention to the performance of our various business segments. [SEP] When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we have a very large and growing installed base. [SEP] This gives us a strong foundation on which to build and expand our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","2684":"During the fourth quarter, our revenue grew 33% year-over-year to $28 billion. This was fueled by a strong holiday shopping season and increased adoption of our advertising products. [SEP] There are 60 million small business pages up on Facebook and 1.5 million Instagram business profiles, which are the similar, the equivalent for Instagram. [SEP] We continue to invest heavily in our small business tools and features, including our Shops platform and appointment booking capabilities. We believe these initiatives will drive even further growth in the months and years ahead. Additionally, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our ad targeting and measurement capabilities, to ensure that businesses are getting the most out of their advertising spend on our platforms.","2685":"During the quarter, we saw strong growth across all of our platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. [SEP] And at the time of course in some way we considered Instagram to be a competitor, but we've always thought that the better way to target -- to think about Instagram was that it's complementary to Facebook and what we're doing. [SEP] We continue to see positive engagement and user growth on Instagram, and we are exploring ways to integrate the platform further into our overall advertising strategy.","2686":"We have seen a significant increase in advertising revenue this quarter. [SEP] An ad that works really well 30 seconds in other platforms and more traditional platforms can work on ours, but the ones that are optimized and use our targeting really perform better. [SEP] Our team is constantly working to improve our targeting capabilities to provide even better results for our advertisers.","2687":"We've seen a lot of volatility in the market over the past few months, with many companies facing challenges in meeting their earnings targets. [SEP] That has had the effect of protecting our margins, which you've seen have been very strong, both in the December quarter and in the guidance that we provide for the March quarter. [SEP] We believe that our strategy of focusing on our core competencies, investing in research and development, and streamlining our operations has positioned us well for future success.","2688":"Moving on to our cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, remained a key driver of growth this quarter. [SEP] You clearly see our \u2013 we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. [SEP] Despite these price decreases, AWS continues to outperform our expectations and we remain confident in its ability to drive long-term revenue growth.","2689":"We've seen strong growth in our console sales over the past quarter, but we're aware that we need to diversify our revenue streams to remain competitive in the long-term. [SEP] But our real strategy going forward is not only to do great work on the console, but to complement that with the work we're doing on the PC. [SEP] We believe that by expanding our offerings to the PC market, we can tap into a new and growing customer base while still maintaining our dedication to high-quality game development.","2690":"Can you provide some detail on what drove the revenue increase in the last quarter? [SEP] million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange, but what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on. [SEP] Do you anticipate continued growth in the upcoming quarter?\" \n\n\"So while foreign exchange did have an impact, our overall revenue growth was quite strong. We attribute this to the success of our holiday marketing campaigns, as well as our efforts to expand into new markets. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about our ability to maintain this momentum and achieve our long-term growth objectives.","2691":"Our team has been working diligently to optimize our supply chain and reduce costs across the board. We have also invested in research and development to improve the quality and performance of our devices. [SEP] And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve [SEP] In addition to our OEM business, we are excited about the growth potential of our direct-to-consumer sales channel. We have seen strong demand for our products and are confident in our ability to capture market share in this space.","2692":"We are constantly thinking about how we can better serve our users and businesses on our platform. [SEP] But the long term bet is that by enabling people to have good organic interactions with businesses, that will end up being a massive multiplier on the value of the monetization down the road when we work on that and really focus on that in a bigger way. [SEP] We believe that creating meaningful connections between users and businesses will not only drive revenue, but also benefit the overall ecosystem of our platform in the long run.","2693":"We're really excited about a new product launch we had earlier this year. It's a game-changer for our industry and we've already seen significant adoption rates. [SEP] It took us a little while to really get it to work the way that we wanted, but now it's growing quickly, that's going to be hundreds of millions of people who are using it. [SEP] As a result, we're forecasting strong revenue growth this quarter and into the next year.

[SEP] And just a couple months ago, we announced a new curriculum that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, for kids that did not have coding in their elementary and high school years.

We've already seen positive feedback and are constantly evaluating and refining our approach to best serve our customers.","2703":"During the quarter, we saw strong performance across our various businesses and are pleased with the overall results. We will now turn to a discussion of our individual revenue streams. [SEP] On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially.

On the other side, our services segment also delivered strong results, with record highs in revenue and profitability. Overall, we see a bright future for our company and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders.","2704":"Can you give us an update on how the company is performing in Europe?

[SEP] Do you have any plans in place to accelerate growth in the European market?","2705":"We're thrilled with the growth we've seen in our advertising revenues. We continue to innovate and provide our advertisers with new and exciting ways to connect with our users. [SEP] And then when we have new opportunities that open up like Stories, even with some pressure on pricing, we think that gives us more inventory and more opportunity and more formats, and we haven't really even gotten started on future things like messaging. [SEP] We also see great potential in our international markets, where we're seeing strong user engagement and increasing advertiser demand. As we continue to invest in our platform, we believe we can drive even more growth and deliver value to our stakeholders.","2706":"We are excited to report our financial results for Q2.

[SEP] Our field resources include a dedicated team of experts who work closely with our clients to ensure they are getting the most out of our products and services.","2708":"Can you speak more to how the transition from Facebook to Instagram has been for advertisers? [SEP] It's also probably worth noting that the experiences we had to date, moving from Facebook to Instagram, were more similar, that the Instagram feed is similar to the Facebook feed in terms of what you can do with advertising. [SEP] Moving forward, we are striving to make the advertising experiences on both platforms even more seamless and intuitive for our advertisers.","2709":"We've noticed that our customers are struggling with some of the formatting requirements in our software. [SEP] And so we're working hard on tools to make the formats easier, and I talked about one of those examples before.

However, we recognize the need to monetize this platform and generate revenue from it. [SEP] So we started off pretty slowly, but that\u2019s going to be some of the basis for how we look to make Messenger a business going forward. [SEP] We have already begun exploring advertising opportunities on Messenger and will also be considering subscription-based models. Our priority is to maintain a seamless user experience while also providing valuable services to businesses who choose to advertise on our platform.","2715":"And now, moving on to the Q&A portion of the call.

[SEP] Yeah, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we're just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. [SEP] Despite the challenges posed by the PN2 ruling, we've seen strong growth in our Indian market over the past few months.","2718":"Now, let's move on to our cloud computing division.

[SEP] So as more people use Stories, we think they will increasingly feel comfortable in Stories. [SEP] We are also exploring new ways to enhance the Stories experience with augmented reality filters and interactive stickers.","2721":"Now, let's talk about the factors that contributed to our strong performance in the last quarter. [SEP] The growth in quarter versus our expectations was really two things that are transactionally focused. [SEP] First, our e-commerce platform saw a significant uptick in sales as a result of our recent digital marketing campaigns.","2722":"In terms of product updates, we've had quite a busy quarter. We've been focused on improving our mobile experience and driving more revenue from our advertising platform. [SEP] So for example, Lead Ads, where people can fill out forms on a mobile device, take their contact info from Facebook, we've rolled that out fully this quarter.

We're excited to participate and showcase our latest products and innovations at this year's event.","2724":"As we look ahead to the future of our advertising strategy, we are particularly excited about one area of focus in particular. [SEP] It's part of our overall ad tech push to bring the effectiveness and relevance of our ads off us. [SEP] We believe this will not only benefit our advertisers but also create a more personalized and positive experience for our users.","2725":"Can you give us an update on the utilization of video on your platform among small and medium-sized businesses? [SEP] million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other platform, but with us it's cheap, it's very easy to use and that gives us a way to continue to work with SMBs and increasingly grow our business with them.

[SEP] However, there have been some concerns about our ability to sustain this growth in the current economic climate. What measures are we taking to address these challenges and continue our success?","2728":"Now let's talk about our commercial cloud gross margins. [SEP] If you think about the portion of our commercial cloud gross margins that come from depreciation, it's best to think of it as roughly half. [SEP] The other half of the gross margins comes from services and other revenue streams.","2729":"As we look ahead to our next quarter, we are continuing our focus on innovation and finding new ways to engage with our customers. [SEP] So, one example of some of the things that we're excited about, again, are the click-to-Messenger ads.

Specifically, I'm curious about your approach to expansion in India and China. [SEP] And the age of the population, if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25. [SEP] That's a very interesting point you bring up about the age demographics. How does that affect your marketing and product development in India? Are there any unique challenges or opportunities that come with such a young consumer base?","2731":"We have seen significant growth in our R&D department in the past year and want to continue investing in this area in order to drive innovation and growth. Our focus has been on identifying opportunities to create value and stay ahead of industry trends. [SEP] because our R&D is focused on that, which is how do we take these buckets of value creation and reinforce them with all of the future R&D as well.

[SEP] If you compare to the iPhone 5s, what we're seeing is the upgrade rate today is slightly higher or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a similar time period in terms of rate than the iPhone 5s. [SEP] This is a promising trend that we hope to maintain with future product releases.","2733":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings conference call. [SEP] And so we think that does help us in that environment, but clearly, macroeconomics stands out there as a risk on top of other issues that we face, leading to a deceleration of revenue growth in 2019. [SEP] However, we are confident in our strategy and believe we are well positioned to navigate these challenges and drive long-term growth.","2734":"We saw a significant increase in revenue from this time last year due to the pandemic-related surge in demand. [SEP] So, yes, that will be a factor that we're comping for the next 12 months. [SEP] However, we believe that our strong brand reputation and loyal customer base will help us continue to grow even as we face these challenging comparables.","2735":"We have noticed a significant increase in our website traffic over the past quarter.

This aligns with our overall strategy of increasing user engagement and maximizing ad revenue.","2736":"Can you expand on your digital strategy and how it ties into your overall growth plan? [SEP] So at least the vision that we have is that every customer is a digital company that will have a digital IP component to it, and that we want to be able to partner with them in pretty unique ways. [SEP] We're making significant investments in our digital capabilities, including building out our team and technology infrastructure, to ensure we can deliver on this vision.","2737":"We've come a long way since we first started out in this industry. [SEP] So there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be as good as some of the other players in the industry, but I think we've been able to prove that we can compete and succeed in this market. [SEP] Our recent growth and expansion into new markets is a testament to our ability to adapt and thrive.","2738":"We're now going to open the call up for questions from our analysts and investors. [SEP] One of the benefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. [SEP] We believe this will allow us to improve margins and continue to invest in future growth opportunities.","2739":"Our Q3 results have exceeded expectations, and we are thrilled to share with you some of the highlights. [SEP] Because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth which includes what we ship, includes FBA, is significantly higher than even that. [SEP] We are confident that our investments in fulfillment, technology, and innovation will continue to drive growth in both our domestic and international markets.","2740":"Our data analytics team has been closely monitoring the usage of various big data platforms. [SEP] We see lots of Hadoop usage inside of IaaS but we also see HD inside growth. [SEP] In addition to Hadoop and HD inside, we are also exploring other cloud-based data solutions for potential integration into our systems.","2741":"The question is about the different levels of privacy that users can have on our platform. [SEP] And also there's a range from private one-on-one type sharing to small groups, all of your friends at once, large interface communities, and then ultimately fully public. [SEP] We believe that offering this range of options allows our users to tailor their experience to their own needs and preferences.","2742":"We're now opening up the call for questions. We've covered a lot of ground so far. [SEP] So we've been rolling out a number of changes, both product changes and ranking the News Feed.

[SEP] These partnerships have allowed us to expand our market reach and access new customers.","2747":"One of the challenges we faced in the second quarter was a decrease in sales compared to the previous quarter. [SEP] The other element that is there and it\u2019s very seasonal, it\u2019s always there, it\u2019s the loss of leverage that we got from Q1 to Q2. [SEP] However, we expect to regain that leverage in the upcoming months as we implement new cost-saving measures.","2748":"We have received a lot of positive feedback from our marketers about our latest campaigns and strategies. [SEP] So I think in terms of the ROI we are able to offer our marketers, the signs are strong, and we also continue to see there's a lot of room for improvement. [SEP] As we move forward, we are focused on leveraging new technology and data analytics to further optimize our ROI and drive even better results for our clients.","2749":"Moving on to our revenue breakdowns, let's focus on the 'other' category. [SEP] So other revenue, which is principally advertising grew 45% this quarter, up from 37% last quarter and the biggest thing in there is advertising and advertising grew at a rate higher than that 45%. [SEP] This growth is attributed to our increased investment in targeted digital marketing campaigns and partnerships with high-profile brands.","2750":"Looking at our financials for the quarter, I'm pleased to report that we saw growth in both revenue and gross margin. As we shift more towards cloud services, we've been able to see these improvements. [SEP] I think we can continue to improve gross margin percentages in the cloud across all the core cloud services. [SEP] With our continued focus on efficiency and cost control measures, I believe we can sustain this upward trend in gross margin. We're also exploring new avenues for revenue growth within the cloud, such as expanding our offerings to include more niche services.","2751":"Our Q3 earnings report was just released and I am pleased to announce that Samsung has continued to perform strongly.

[SEP] As a result of our efforts, we were able to see a 25% improvement in our profit margins for the quarter.","2754":"We've seen unprecedented growth in our e-commerce business over the past year, driven in part by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift in consumer behavior. Our partnership with Amazon has been a key part of this growth, as we've expanded our reach and improved our fulfillment capabilities.

We're also exploring new partnerships and channels to reach even more customers and drive sustained growth over the long term.","2755":"Can you speak to the trend of businesses moving towards cloud-based productivity tools?

We believe that by continuing to innovate and provide new value to our users, we can maintain this momentum and drive long-term growth for our business.","2768":"Now let's turn our attention to our advertising strategy for our Stories feature. [SEP] Part of that is due to the fact that we don\u2019t have as many direct response formats in Stories, so that reduces the opportunities for conversion opportunities on Stories. [SEP] However, we are actively working on expanding our direct response options in Stories to increase the potential for conversions.","2769":"Moving on to our content business, I would like to focus on our video offerings.

[SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new mobile advertising initiatives to further capitalize on this trend.","2779":"During the quarter, we made significant progress on our cloud migration strategy. [SEP] because for the first time you can take a single table in a database and you would tier it with the cloud, and that kind of capability only we can provide, and that's something that I'm looking forward to. [SEP] This innovation will not only improve our customer experience but also increase efficiency and reduce costs.","2780":"We want to thank all of our investors and shareholders for joining us on this earnings conference call.

Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made on Instagram and Facebook, and we believe there's still ample room for growth in this space.","2782":"We've been working hard to plan for the upcoming holiday season. [SEP] And the biggest issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year.

Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and excited about the opportunities ahead.","2784":"Our R&D team has been hard at work exploring new product and service offerings that we believe will drive significant growth in the coming years. [SEP] So as part of the overall hiring on R&D head count, there's going be a pretty significant allocation of that to some of the product-related security initiatives that we're doing.

[SEP] And I think that's more the case than the risk that a lot of folks have pointed out. [SEP] However, we do acknowledge that there are some uncertainties in the market and we are closely watching how the situation unfolds.","2786":"Our goal is to provide our customers with a seamless experience across our suite of products. [SEP] Similarly on Talent, they want to be able to \u2013 if you start on LinkedIn with hiring, you want to be able to do the on-boarding and talent management.

[SEP] Same thing on Azure, which is \u2013 the driver is \u2013 a lot of it is net new. [SEP] How do you see competition in the cloud market evolving in the next few years?\" \n\nSame thing on Azure, which is \u2013 the driver is \u2013 a lot of it is net new.

We believe that our cloud platform is well positioned to remain a market leader in the years ahead.","2797":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our cloud services in the past year. [SEP] So while I am focused on both the workload improvement, I'm also focused on what's possible across the entirety of the cloud.

[SEP] Additionally, our research and development team is constantly exploring new technologies and features to integrate into future products, further driving customer excitement and adoption.","2800":"One of the things that we think really sets us apart is our ability to integrate hardware, software and services. [SEP] And all of the things that are coming both in the fall, the things that we've announced that you can see with iOS 10, hopefully you're running by now with the beta, those and other things make it even more instrumental. [SEP] So all in all, we're very excited about where we are and where we're headed.","2801":"During the pandemic, people have embraced virtual meetings and events as an alternative to in-person gatherings. As a result, our online customer engagement has increased by 35% in the last quarter. [SEP] If you wanted to feel like you were interacting with someone running for office before, you had to go to a town hall meeting. [SEP] However, we want to take it a step further and provide a unique experience for our customers. That's why we are launching a new virtual platform that will allow our customers to interact with our executives in a town hall setting from the comfort of their homes. We believe this initiative will increase customer loyalty and satisfaction while also driving our revenue growth.","2802":"We've seen tremendous growth in our live streaming feature over the past year. In fact, we recently hit a new record for the number of concurrent viewers on a single live stream. This is a very exciting area for us, and we're constantly working to improve the user experience.

[SEP] We're also exploring new ways to monetize live streaming, including through advertising and sponsorships. We believe there's a lot of potential in this area, especially as more and more people look for ways to connect with others online. Overall, we're very bullish on the future of live streaming and its role in our platform.","2803":"Our customer obsession is at the core of our business strategy and we remain committed to delivering best-in-class service.

[SEP] We're excited about the growth potential in this region, and we're investing heavily in expanding our network infrastructure to support it.","2805":"We are pleased to report another strong quarter of growth for our company. Our net sales have increased by 20% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides.

[SEP] We've also seen a significant increase in user engagement and customer satisfaction since these updates have been implemented.","2809":"Our earnings report demonstrates impressive growth in the Asian market, particularly in China. [SEP] Also, if I zoom out and look at China, as I have said before and just to make the point once again is we see an enormous change in China over the next several years. [SEP] This change is largely due to the growing middle class and their increased purchasing power, which presents significant growth opportunities for our company.","2810":"We've received a lot of questions from our shareholders about how we plan to allocate our cash flow. [SEP] And in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we've provided a amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually. [SEP] However, we want to assure our shareholders that we are committed to investing in growth opportunities that will generate returns over the long-term, while also returning some value to them through dividends.","2811":"Let me now turn to our revenue breakdown by channel. [SEP] So we're very - excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them. [SEP] We continue to see strong growth in our online ordering component, which is primarily driven by the convenience of Prime Now delivery. We expect this trend to continue as more and more customers adopt online ordering as their preferred method of grocery shopping.","2812":"We have received feedback from investors that they would like more transparency and updates on our progress. [SEP] Right now, we're doing it, I think it's every six months, but the goal is to get that to the cadence by, I think it's the end of this year, we're going to be doing it quarterly and doing calls to discuss the results just like we do for earnings [SEP] We believe that increasing the frequency of these updates will improve communication and trust with our stakeholders.

We are excited to see the positive impact this increased transparency and communication will have on our company's performance.","2813":"Our focus on international growth has been a major priority for us over the past year.

[SEP] We have seen a positive response from customers in China since implementing this option, and we believe it will continue to drive sales in the region.","2814":"We saw an increase in revenue during the last quarter, primarily driven by our new product launches and marketing efforts. [SEP] That's just due to product marketing and that's just not going to necessarily be a steady quarter-to-quarter trend. [SEP] However, we anticipate some fluctuations in sales over the next few quarters as we focus on expanding into new markets and increasing our brand visibility.","2815":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our Prime Now service, which continues to be a growth driver for our business.

[SEP] We're also making strategic investments in areas like video, e-commerce, and messaging, which we believe will drive engagement and revenue growth over the long-term. Overall, we're confident in our ability to deliver meaningful value to our users, customers, and shareholders.","2817":"We are thrilled to announce that our partnership with Amazon is bearing fruit.

[SEP] To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter, and that's very important because we're attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported. [SEP] This illustrates the importance of looking beyond just the reported numbers and taking a closer look at product demand and customer preferences.","2823":"As we continue to expand our customer base, we are shifting our focus towards enhancing our relationships with existing clients.

[SEP] And I'm happy to report that we've made significant progress in this area, with a notable increase in successful developers already.","2825":"Our revenue growth this quarter has been slower than expected. While we have made progress in certain areas, such as increasing our customer base, we still face challenges in others. We know we need to do better, and we are committed to taking the necessary steps to achieve our goals. [SEP] And as I mentioned, I think we believe we still have a lot of work to do to continue to improve that. [SEP] One area where we see significant potential for improvement is in our marketing strategy. We plan to invest more heavily in digital advertising and social media, and we are exploring partnerships with influencers and other brands.

We will continue to iterate and improve our ad delivery platform to ensure our advertisers can achieve the best results possible.","2835":"Our team has been closely monitoring our user data over the past quarter.

We are continuing to explore new ways to collect valuable data while also respecting our users' privacy concerns.","2836":"We had a strong year and we are proud of the progress we have made.

Nonetheless, we're eager to take these steps forward and generate even greater value for our shareholders.","2840":"Now I'd like to turn to our growth strategy for the next few years.

[SEP] And I think that's what is really exciting for us as we look forward to the future.","2845":"We've seen steady growth in our revenue and market share, driven by our investments in technology and innovation. [SEP] If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Soup, which obscured this a bit in the last couple of years. [SEP] We're confident that our continued focus on these areas will position us well for future success.","2846":"Our core business may have experienced some challenges this quarter [SEP] But we also have other businesses that are growing very, very fast and actually accelerating. [SEP] Our data analytics and technology divisions have seen tremendous growth and are poised to become significant sources of revenue for our company in the coming years.","2847":"We are committed to meeting the needs of customers by providing them with comprehensive, integrated solutions that optimize their operations. [SEP] because really when you think about the commercial cloud, it's really about capturing the opportunity of selling more complete solutions which include dynamics and office plus some components of Azure which is I think really the trend you'll see us talk about from here on out. [SEP] We believe that the commercial cloud represents a significant growth opportunity for our company, and we are confident that our product offerings will continue to evolve and meet the changing needs of our customers in the years to come.","2848":"We have seen strong growth in the last quarter and are confident in our ability to continue to expand our business in the coming year. [SEP] But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on, yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. [SEP] However, we recognize the current economic climate is uncertain and we will remain vigilant to any potential challenges or risks. Overall, we believe our company is well-positioned for continued success.","2849":"We've seen a significant increase in engagement with our streaming service over the past year,\" said the CEO during the earnings call. \"And we attribute much of that growth to the popularity of devices like Amazon's Fire TV. [SEP] I think it's definitely on the Fire TV devices as well is a great way to consume content. [SEP] In fact, we're looking into ways to develop exclusive content specifically for Fire TV users,\" added the CFO. \"We believe this will further enhance the viewing experience for our customers and help drive even more growth for the company.","2850":"Our company has been working hard to expand our reach in the market and increase our market share. We've also been investing heavily in research and development to improve our products and services. [SEP] And I feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go, which I sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem. [SEP] Nevertheless, we remain optimistic about the future of our company and our ability to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. We will continue to work hard and innovate in order to stay ahead of our competitors and deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Overall, we believe that our strategy and efforts will help us achieve our goals and drive sustainable growth in the years to come.","2851":"Now turning to our cloud division, I'd like to highlight some of the key drivers of our recent growth.\"\n- \"As you may know, we've been heavily investing in our cloud offerings over the past few years. [SEP] Even in Azure, we have things like EMS, we have our data services, even our developer services. [SEP] These services have all seen strong adoption from our enterprise customers, and we expect to see continued growth in these areas.\"\n- \"Overall, we're very encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our cloud business and remain committed to delivering innovative solutions to meet our customers' evolving needs.\"\n- \"Looking ahead, we're also excited about some of the new products and services we have in the pipeline, which we believe will further strengthen our position in the market.","2852":"We saw a slight downturn in revenue during the third quarter, but we believe this was due to a temporary market shift. [SEP] I actually didn't think of it as a significant change in trajectory from what we expected. [SEP] Our projections for the fourth quarter look promising and we anticipate a strong finish to the fiscal year.","2853":"We've seen significant growth in the past quarter, and our sales team has been able to expand our customer base. [SEP] And so I do think \u2013 I don't buy the view that market's saturated. [SEP] In fact, I believe there is still ample opportunity for us to capture more market share, especially in international markets where we have just begun to establish a presence.","2854":"We have been investing heavily in our data platform for the past few years. [SEP] So I think we have a very rich vision and execution on what is an expanding data platform opportunity. [SEP] This allows us to offer innovative solutions to our customers and diversify our revenue streams.","2855":"Thanks for the question. [SEP] On the first question, I think it boils down to whether it will be competitive long term with other options out there. [SEP] We need to continue to monitor the market closely and adapt accordingly as we go forward.","2856":"Thank you for that question. [SEP] Let me take that first question on Prime Air in the UK, we've been working with and developing Prime Air for some time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers. [SEP] We're excited about the progress we've made so far and the potential for Prime Air to revolutionize the way people receive their packages.","2857":"Moving on to our licensing business segment, I'd like to provide an update on our margins. [SEP] The standalone margins on the licensing business have been pretty stable just because transactionally, we understand and continue to bring down the fixed cost base there and any that's required. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our licensing business and remain committed to maximizing profitability through ongoing cost management measures.","2858":"Our focus on enhancing our mobile app and optimizing our mobile website has helped to drive increased engagement and sales through these channels. [SEP] We also think that continued consumer shift to mobile devices bodes well for our growth as well. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new ways to leverage mobile technology, such as incorporating augmented reality features into our shopping experience, to further improve our offerings for our customers.","2859":"We are pleased to report our earnings for the third quarter of 2021. [SEP] this was a fantastic quarter for overall growth of the Facebook community, our strongest absolute MAU and DAU additions year-over-year since being a public company [SEP] We have continued to see strong engagement across all of our platforms and are excited to continue innovating and improving the user experience for our community.","2860":"Our sales have been impressive this year and continue to grow steadily. In particular, our online sales have seen significant growth. [SEP] They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. [SEP] We attribute this increase to a combination of factors, including a strong marketing campaign, improved website functionality, and an increase in demand for our products. We are optimistic about our sales for the remainder of the year and are focused on continuing to provide our customers with exceptional products and service.","2861":"We have received a lot of positive feedback on our recent cost-cutting measures. [SEP] So we\u2019re going to do that though, with great discipline, and that\u2019s what I think you\u2019ve seen us do over the course of the last year, and we\u2019ll continue to exhibit that. [SEP] Our goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet while still investing in growth opportunities.","2862":"Thank you for your question. I'd like to take the opportunity to address our product development process. Over the past year, we've made some significant changes to our approach, particularly in how we use customer feedback to inform our decisions. [SEP] And that's where we are seeing some very significant good feedback loops and shaping even our future road map. [SEP] We're also implementing new tools and techniques for gathering and analyzing customer data, which we believe will further improve our ability to create products that meet their needs. Overall, we're very optimistic about the direction we're heading in and look forward to sharing more updates on our progress in the coming months.","2863":"Our company has seen steady growth in our customer base over the past year, and we are pleased to announce increased revenue as a result. We offer a range of services to meet the diverse needs of our clients, from software solutions to consulting services. [SEP] Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. [SEP] This overlap in subscribers has led to even greater revenue generation for our company. We will continue to explore opportunities to cross-sell our services and provide added value to our customers. Overall, we are optimistic about our future growth potential as we work to meet the evolving demands of the market.","2864":"Our company has seen significant growth over the past year, particularly in the area of cloud services. [SEP] From a mix of services, it starts always with, I would say, infrastructure, so this is the edge and the cloud, the infrastructure being used as compute. [SEP] As we continue to expand our offering in the infrastructure space, we are also looking to develop new services that build on this foundation.","2865":"With the pandemic still affecting businesses, we expected to see a continued increase in demand for cloud services. [SEP] We actually saw better bookings in Q1 again on Azure, as I mentioned, just like we did in Q4. [SEP] Our focus for the next quarter is to continue to innovate and provide even better services to our customers.","2866":"Our quarterly earnings report shows a mixed bag of results. Revenue from cloud services has surpassed our expectations, but we have noticed a decline in commercial licensing. During this conference call, we would like to address this issue and discuss our strategies to maintain profitability. [SEP] And so while we have a comparability issue that will show itself most directly as weakness in commercial licensing and most specifically as weakness in Office transactional licensing which will be a headwind, the overall goal of continuing to have more customers every quarter move to the cloud or whether or not they move, adding cloud services even if they have on prem ises licenses, is going to continue to be a very good business for us. [SEP] Our team is committed to driving innovation and developing new cloud-based solutions that will meet the evolving needs of our customers. While we acknowledge the challenges posed by the current market conditions, we remain confident about our long-term growth prospects. As we navigate through these uncertain times, our priority is to stay nimble and agile and to position ourselves for continued success in the future.","2867":"Our Q3 results show significant growth in revenue and net income despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. We're pleased with the progress we're making in expanding our product line and customer base. [SEP] We've managed to do that by continuing to pivot to what I believe are these very high ROI opportunities, and pivoting away from opportunities where we've had a chance to become more efficient, and the rate of returns are not going to be as high, or the structural growth isn't there. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're confident that our focus on high ROI opportunities will continue to drive growth and profitability. We remain committed to innovation and technology leadership in our industry, and we're excited about the prospects for long-term success. Thank you for your support and interest in our company.","2868":"Our team has been focused on growing our cloud-based products, and we have seen strong performance in the last quarter. We are excited about the potential of our subscription-based Office 365 product and have made it a priority to invest in its development. [SEP] We also are working to make Office 365 and seeing good traction in segments like small business. [SEP] We have also been working to improve the user experience of Office 365 and have received positive feedback from our customers. In addition to small businesses, we are seeing growth in the education and enterprise segments as well. Overall, we believe that Office 365 will continue to be a key driver of revenue growth for our company in the coming years.","2869":"Our team has been making significant investments in developing new technology and creating exciting content to enhance our product offerings. [SEP] So, there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. [SEP] As we continue to prioritize these efforts, we anticipate seeing continued growth in these areas in the upcoming quarters.","2870":"One area of focus for our company has been improving our shipping capabilities. [SEP] We do believe that, although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends month to date. [SEP] Additionally, we will continue to monitor and analyze customer behavior to determine the impact of faster shipping on our sales trends.","2871":"During the quarter, we saw an increase in the adoption of our cloud services. We believe this is due in part to our focus on integrating our various offerings across platforms. [SEP] So for example, when you log into Windows, you are logging in with Microsoft account or Azure ID. [SEP] This integration allows for a seamless experience for our users, as they are able to access their data and applications on any device. We are also seeing increased use of our identity services, such as Azure Active Directory, which allows for secure and simplified access to online resources.","2872":"Can you speak to the advantages of your public cloud offering over other providers?\" \n\nStatement: \"And so we have a very good process and that\u2019s a place were quite frankly a lot of the proprietary advantage of someone who is an at scale public cloud provider, not just with one application. [SEP] And so we have a very good process and that\u2019s a place were quite frankly a lot of the proprietary advantage of someone who is an at scale public cloud provider, not just with one application. [SEP] We believe this process gives us a competitive edge in the market and allows us to continue to grow our customer base and revenue.","2873":"Our company has been focused on digital transformation and embracing new technology trends. [SEP] One of the things that we realize is as every company out there becomes a software company, beyond even our traditional reach through IT, everyone has a digital office inside the company. [SEP] To address this new reality, we are exploring opportunities to expand our software offerings and provide solutions that cater to different industries and business functions.","2874":"We\u2019ve been investing a lot in our digital advertising strategy, and while we\u2019ve seen some great successes, there have also been some learning curves. [SEP] I think one of the challenges we\u2019ve had is training the market that you can\u2019t just take your TV ads and put them on video \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, put them on mobile or put them into Facebook [SEP] We\u2019re continuing to work closely with our marketing team to ensure that we\u2019re creating mobile and Facebook-specific content that adds value to our customers and fits seamlessly into their browsing experience.","2875":"Can you speak more about your strategy for content on Facebook? [SEP] So when it comes to \u2013 there are lots of businesses on Facebook, there are professional content producers, our main interest here is the people in the community who are using News Feed, not those guys, right? [SEP] We want to prioritize the user experience and ensure that they are seeing content from their friends and family, as well as relevant news and information from credible sources.","2876":"We have a question now from Heather regarding our cloud adoption. Heather, please go ahead. [SEP] We definitely are seeing production workloads that are moving over from on premise, but I think the more interesting thing Heather for us is to see new workloads. [SEP] And that's where we really see the potential for growth, as more and more companies embrace cloud technology for innovative applications and services. Our focus is on providing the best possible solutions to address these new workloads and help our customers stay ahead of the game.","2877":"Now, moving on to our discussion regarding our competitors in the market. [SEP] But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members. [SEP] We're confident that by continuing to focus on providing excellent customer service, we'll remain competitive in the long term.","2878":"In response to a question about our new robotic packaging program, I'd like to provide an update on how it's been performing. [SEP] We continue to be really pleased with the program and like what it does in the warehouse, both from a density of storage, as well as from making the jobs easier for the associates who are picking packages, by bringing the packages actually to the associates. [SEP] Additionally, we've seen a significant reduction in the time it takes to fulfill orders, which has resulted in an increase in both customer satisfaction and repeat business.","2879":"We've seen a lot of interest from advertisers wanting to compare the effectiveness of their TV ads and Facebook ads. They want to know if they are getting the same return on investment (ROI) from both channels. [SEP] So that's where TRP buying comes in, allowing people who usually buy TV ads to plan, buy and measure Facebook ads the same way, enables apples-to-apples comparison that we believe is very strong for our ROI. [SEP] We believe that TRP buying will be a game-changer for our advertising partners. It will provide them with a seamless way to manage both TV and Facebook ads, and give them a more complete understanding of their ad performance. We're excited to see how our advertisers will use this new feature to drive results.","2880":"During the past quarter, our team has been diligently working on implementing processes and protocols to ensure a safer and more secure experience for our users. We recognize the importance of content moderation and have taken steps to address any harmful or dangerous content that may appear on our platform. [SEP] I gave the example of the terrorism-related content and some things around suicidal post where if someone posts something that they're thinking about suicide. [SEP] As a company, we are committed to providing a safe and positive environment for all of our users. We take reports of harmful content seriously and have a dedicated team investigating each and every report. We will continue to monitor and improve our content moderation processes to ensure the safety and well-being of our user community.","2881":"Moving on to our Office Commercial segment, we saw some unexpected challenges in Q1 that impacted our results. [SEP] Office Commercial actually had a pretty reasonable quarter given some of the impacts we had in Q1, a couple of points of impact of extra growth that we talked about. [SEP] Additionally, we are seeing strong demand for flexible office space solutions within this segment, and we are continuing to invest in this area to meet the needs of our customers.","2882":"We had a challenging year due to the impact of the pandemic on our business operations. We experienced supply chain disruptions, reduced consumer demand, and changes in consumer behavior. [SEP] Those are headwinds that we had this year and were not there a year ago. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we were still able to generate strong earnings and maintain market share. We are confident that with the rollout of vaccines and continued adaptations to the business environment, we will be able to build on our success.","2883":"Investor: Can you speak to the recent removal of some of your popular apps in certain countries? \n\nCompany representative: Yes, we have had to remove some of our apps in certain countries due to regulatory and legal issues. [SEP] We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business. [SEP] Company representative: However, we are constantly exploring options to work with local authorities and find solutions that allow us to continue offering our services in compliance with local laws. \n\nInvestor: Understood. And can you comment on how this has impacted your financial performance in those regions? \n\nCompany representative: It's too early to tell at this point, but we are closely monitoring the situation and will provide updates as necessary in our future earnings reports.","2884":"Our team has been closely monitoring the impact of our recent content strategy. We've analyzed engagement rates and shares across multiple platforms. [SEP] And in each one, we talk about the prevalence of the content that people see because we think what matters is the number of impressions or people who are seeing the content, not just \u2013 not if a lot of people are sharing something but no one sees it \u2013 but what is actually getting seen. [SEP] Through our analysis, we've discovered that certain types of content perform better than others in terms of achieving high impression rates. As such, we've focused our efforts on crafting content that resonates with our audience and maximizes visibility. Our goal is to continue to grow our reach and build a stronger connection with our followers.","2885":"We have had tremendous growth in our cloud database services division. [SEP] So for a long time, we talked about Redshift, and Aurora has now outpaced that. [SEP] Aurora's performance has exceeded our expectations and we will continue to invest in its development.","2886":"Our focus this quarter has been on improving our user engagement and expanding our customer base. [SEP] And what you're going to see from us is very small steps to get more people in and make this deeper across the experience people have. [SEP] We're confident that these incremental changes will lead to long-term growth and improved revenue for the company.","2887":"Can you explain how your advertising pricing model works? [SEP] So there's not differential pricing by product, it's just what are you willing to bid for the format that you want to show to the people that you want to show it to and that's how the system works. [SEP] Are there any limitations or restrictions on who can bid or what products can be advertised?\"\n\nAnswer: \"Sure, our pricing model is based on a bidding system where advertisers bid for ad space for the format they want to show to their target audience. There's no differential pricing by product; it's just how much are you willing to bid for the ad format that you want to show to the people that you want to show it to. Our system is designed to be fair and transparent, so all advertisers have an equal opportunity to place ads based on their budget and desired audience. We do have certain guidelines for acceptable ads and prohibited content, but otherwise, anyone with an advertising account can bid on available space in our system.","2888":"We have been making significant investments in our research and development capabilities to enhance the value we bring to our customers. [SEP] And so I think as long as we focus on providing that value, we'll feel good about our opportunity to both grow and take share in the market. [SEP] In addition, we are also exploring strategic partnerships and collaborations that will allow us to expand our reach in untapped markets.","2889":"Our latest earnings report shows that we had a strong quarter with revenue growth of 42% year-over-year. [SEP] because as Mark said, we care not just about time spent on Facebook, but time well spent. [SEP] In order to continue to prioritize time well spent, we are investing in new technologies and features that will enhance the user experience and promote meaningful interactions on our platform.","2890":"Our quarterly earnings report has been impressive and we are pleased to share details about our performance today. Our team has been working diligently to drive growth in various market segments. [SEP] And then finally, we're seeing the introduction of low-priced data plans in markets like India and Mexico contributing.

We expect these initiatives to continue to drive growth in the coming quarters and position us for long-term success. Thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to your questions.","2891":"During the last quarter, we had an aggressive strategy to launch our new product in the market. [SEP] We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. [SEP] However, due to unexpected delays in production, we had to postpone the launch until the next quarter.","2892":"We have seen significant growth in our Stories feature over the past quarter. [SEP] Now right now, one of the interesting things about Stories is there's a benefit to being an early adopter. [SEP] As more and more users begin to adopt this feature, we anticipate that the advantage of being an early adopter will diminish.","2893":"We've been working hard on developing new technology that will revolutionize the retail industry. [SEP] I see things that the consumer's going to love because it's going to change shopping. [SEP] Our team is confident that these changes will not only improve the consumer experience, but also increase sales and revenue.","2894":"We have been evaluating different options to optimize our fulfillment process. One potential solution that we are exploring is the implementation of a new inventory management system. [SEP] If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern. [SEP] We believe that this approach will enable us to improve our overall efficiency and deliver a better customer experience. As we continue to assess the feasibility of this initiative, we will be sure to keep our stakeholders informed of our progress.","2895":"Our team has been working hard to improve our advertising products and provide better value for our customers.

[SEP] We've seen strong growth in advertising revenue over the past quarter, and we're optimistic about our future growth prospects.","2896":"We have been working on improving our cloud solutions and integrating them with other cloud platforms. Our customers have been requesting the ability to use our cloud services in conjunction with other cloud services. [SEP] So we \u2013 for example, you can in fact do a single sign-on using EMS and Azure AD in Azure and use \u2013 so your resources on AWS. [SEP] This ability to seamlessly integrate different cloud platforms is something we are very proud of and we believe it will set us apart from our competitors. We are looking forward to seeing how our customers will take advantage of this new feature and we are excited to continue to improve our cloud offerings moving forward.","2897":"Now, let's turn our attention to the performance of our cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services. [SEP] So over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.","2900":"Our revenue growth in Q2 was impressive. [SEP] It grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1. [SEP] This is a clear indication that our strategy is working and we remain optimistic about the remainder of the year.","2901":"In terms of our mobile strategy, we have been making great progress over the past year. [SEP] On Instagram, we think that with Facebook and Instagram, we now have the two most important mobile platforms out there. [SEP] And we're excited to see how we can continue to leverage these platforms to reach and engage with even more users.","2902":"Now, turning to our performance during the holiday season. [SEP] As we mentioned in our press release, the unit sales of Echoes grew nine times, 9x, year-over-year during the holiday period. [SEP] We are delighted with these results and they reflect the increasing popularity and consumer demand for our Echo products.","2903":"We're very pleased with the strong financial results we reported today. Our revenue grew 13% year-over-year, driven by strong performance across our cloud, gaming, and LinkedIn businesses. We also saw solid growth in our Surface devices and Windows OEM revenue. [SEP] And I think maybe, I should have also mentioned, when you think about seeing that type of performance and Satya mentioned it is not just because of work done this quarter, it is a great point, but it\u2019s also the investments we\u2019ve made. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain focused on investing in our future growth opportunities. We're continuing to build out our cloud infrastructure, deepen our partnerships with key customers, and expand our product offerings. We're confident that these investments will drive strong results for our business over the long term.","2904":"Our international expansion strategy has been very successful so far. [SEP] But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries. [SEP] We have already secured partnerships with several major streaming platforms in key international markets.","2905":"We are thrilled to report another successful quarter with impressive growth in our customer base. We have been aggressively expanding our product offerings and marketing efforts to reach new customers. [SEP] And so while we feel great about continuing to add seats at that type of rate, converting and adding net new into our install base, you will see that growth rate come down just because the business is getting quite big. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to sustain a strong growth trajectory in the long-term. Our focus now is on enhancing product features and driving customer engagement to deepen our relationships with existing clients. We also plan to explore new markets and geographies to further expand our reach.","2906":"Thank you for your question. [SEP] I think the first half of your question was does the $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion full-year OpEx guide reflect the timing of the implementation of our restructuring, and it certainly does. [SEP] We expect the implementation of our restructuring to result in cost savings and operational efficiencies, and we remain on track to achieve our financial targets for the year.","2907":"Our company is thrilled to announce our continued growth in the e-commerce market. [SEP] We're able to do this, because we spent 20 plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us. [SEP] However, with the strong demand for online shopping continuing to rise, we believe it's worth it to make this investment in order to better serve our customers and stay competitive in the industry.","2908":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. We are pleased to report strong revenue growth and profitability, driven by our focus on operational efficiency and strategic investments. [SEP] On the rest of the P&L, there again we have, I believe some of the best infrastructure people in the industry.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our talent and infrastructure to drive sustainable growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.","2909":"We have seen a significant increase in online sales over the past quarter.

[SEP] However, it's important to note that this category includes more than just Prime Now orders, such as orders made through our website and other online platforms.","2910":"And now let's move on to our plans for the upcoming fiscal year. [SEP] So that\u2019s how Windows will differentiate and not to mention, our Gaming and Xbox Live experiences. [SEP] We have a lot of exciting new games and features in the pipeline that we believe will continue to drive growth in this area.","2911":"Can you speak to the company's approach to expanding into new markets? [SEP] And so, I think that that basic model where you look around the world and find the best in different areas, I don't expect that model to go out of style, so to speak. [SEP] This strategy has served us well in the past and will continue to be a key driver of our growth moving forward.","2912":"Now we'll take some questions from analysts on the call. Who has the first question? [SEP] To the Instagram question, what we see in the short run is that some of the spend on Instagram is incremental to Facebook and some isn't. [SEP] We're constantly analyzing the data to understand how the two platforms complement each other and where we can optimize spend. Overall, we're pleased with the results we're seeing from both Facebook and Instagram advertising.","2913":"Can you speak to how recent events in the market have impacted your operations in China?

[SEP] So, we've actually seen an increase in demand for our products in that region.","2914":"We've been closely studying the messaging platform market in preparation for our upcoming product launch. [SEP] I do think, as you say, this is one of the rare times in business where you can look at messaging platforms that exist and see how they've successfully monetized in other parts of the world and have that be a floor. [SEP] Of course, we'll be looking to go beyond that floor and find innovative ways to generate revenue from our platform.","2915":"Our focus on community building has led to the growth of our user base. We've seen a surge in daily active users over the past quarter. [SEP] They're not coming necessarily to engage in a specific type of video or specific community around video. [SEP] Instead, they're coming to our platform for the overall experience. We believe this is indicative of the strength of our brand and our ability to create an engaging and user-friendly product.

[SEP] One that is very, very important for us is the fact that the App Store, which is the largest of our Services categories, is seeing an increasingly larger amount of paying accounts.

We believe our Services business will continue to be a major driver of growth in the years ahead.","2918":"Our company has seen significant growth in the past quarter.

[SEP] And we think that that's the kind of experience that we can uniquely build and that that's going to further our mission and just be a unique thing that we can add to the world. [SEP] We believe that this product will not only differentiate us from our competitors, but also continue to drive our growth and revenue for years to come.","2923":"One of the key factors driving our revenue growth this quarter was our strong partnerships with advertisers. [SEP] So working with us, they did five video ads, and on our platform, they could not just do the video format but they could target millennials and people who like spicy food, which is very specific targeting. [SEP] As a result of this targeted approach, we saw a significant increase in engagement and click-through rates compared to previous campaigns.","2924":"Now, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO to discuss our financial results for the quarter.

And part of that means we've had to rethink how we approach payments. [SEP] So we view the payment in that context not as the goal, but as something that's helping the business and the person succeed at having the transaction or doing what they're trying to do. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe that if we can help our customers complete their transactions quickly and seamlessly, that will lead to greater loyalty and more business down the road. So we see these payments not just as a means of getting paid, but as a way to build stronger relationships with our customers and drive growth for the company.","2927":"We have decided to adjust our pricing strategy for our database software offering.

As you can see on the data sheet in front of you, we've achieved a 21% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year.

[SEP] And we're pleased to report that our efforts have resulted in a record-breaking quarter for App Store revenue.","2937":"In terms of profitability, we have been focusing on increasing our gross margin over the past few quarters.

[SEP] So it's at 97%, still very strong, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter in other revenue as I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by a good margin is the advertising revenue and we are comping a period of rapid growth in the prior year, so that is part of the factor there as you mentioned, but I\u2019d just reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong adoption across Amazon\u2019s vendors, sellers, authors, all types of advertisers that are utilizing that.

We've learned a lot from our successes and challenges in the past, and we're committed to taking a more strategic approach going forward. [SEP] We definitely need to be smart about two things that Amy said before, which is pick markets that are secular growth markets and got big TAM. [SEP] Of course, it's not enough to just pick the right markets - we also need to execute well in those markets and stay ahead of the competition. But starting with the right foundation in terms of market selection will give us a much better chance of success in the long run.

[SEP] However, we have also faced some challenges in other areas of our business, such as declining sales in our retail division.","2967":"We're really bullish on video. We think that video is actually going to be one of the primary ways that people communicate in the future.

[SEP] We believe that this provides a more comprehensive understanding of where our revenue is coming from and how it's trending over time.","2974":"Our advertising revenue has been steadily increasing over the past few years, primarily driven by an increase in ad load. However, we recognize the potential risks associated with excessive ad load, such as decreased user engagement and retention.

[SEP] In order to mitigate these risks, we have implemented several measures to improve the overall user experience on our platform, such as reducing the frequency of ads and improving our targeting capabilities. We believe that these efforts will not only benefit our users, but also support the long-term growth of our advertising business.","2975":"Now let's take a look at our company's performance over the past year.

[SEP] And then immediately after you do something like preventive maintenance, you need field service. [SEP] How do you ensure that your field service technicians are properly trained and equipped to address any issues that may arise?","2986":"Thank you for the question. I would like to take a moment to talk about our company's mission and values.

[SEP] We believe that by staying true to these objectives, we can continue to drive strong revenue growth and create long-term shareholder value.","2987":"Our Q2 earnings report has revealed some concerning trends that we need to address in the coming months. [SEP] First of all, it\u2019s the loss of leverage from the sequential decline in revenue. [SEP] Additionally, we are seeing increased competition in our industry, which is putting pressure on pricing and margins.","2988":"We have been working diligently over the past year to combat the spread of fake news and misinformation on our platform. [SEP] With this specific change which is one of a number of News Feed changes that are geared at improving the quality and trustworthiness of news on Facebook.

We look forward to exploring new ways to innovate and improve our mobile advertising solutions.","2990":"We've seen some impressive numbers come out of our Greater China market over the last year. [SEP] And so even though we were reporting a similar year-over-year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which probably is much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration. [SEP] We're continuing to invest in that market, which we believe has a lot of potential for long-term growth.","2991":"We're now going to talk about our sales revenues for the third quarter. [SEP] That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with our performance during this period and we anticipate continued growth in the upcoming quarter.","2992":"We've seen a lot of interest from our customers in upgrading to our latest model. However, we understand that upgrade cycles are influenced by a variety of factors. [SEP] And so when you think about upgrade cycles, upgrade cycles would have varying rates on it. [SEP] For example, some customers may be more inclined to upgrade frequently due to their profession or personal preferences. Other customers may only upgrade when their current device becomes obsolete. It's important for us to consider these different factors when forecasting our sales and revenues.","2993":"We've seen some great growth in our advertising revenue this quarter, with a 15% increase compared to last year. [SEP] On that latter point, really the mix of ad units is part of what we're doing I think really well. [SEP] We are continuously working to optimize the ad units for a better user experience and higher engagement.","2994":"We've been working on this new product for several months now and I'm thrilled to announce that it's finally ready for launch. [SEP] And it feels great to get this thing going at a level that can get all of the developers behind it, so I couldn't be more excited about it. [SEP] Our early tests have been incredibly successful and we're confident that this product will be a major driver of growth for us in the coming year.","2995":"Can you give us an update on the progress of your expansion plans? [SEP] But you are right that we are moving very slowly and very, very, very carefully because we want to make sure the entire experiences is right across the board before we go deeper and go broader. [SEP] Do you anticipate any obstacles that could slow down this process?\"\n\n\"We're closely monitoring customer feedback and gathering data to ensure that our approach is sustainable,\" the CEO added. \"We believe that this deliberate approach will result in greater overall success in the long run.","2996":"Our Q3 earnings report shows impressive results, with a significant uptick in our revenue. [SEP] We're seeing strong growth in brand, and we believe that's because we're delivering on the promise of personalized marketing at scale. [SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to invest in innovative technologies to further improve our personalized marketing efforts and deliver even greater results for our clients.","2997":"Now let's take a closer look at our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] And obviously with the aggregate or the consolidated number being 112%, it's hard to find a lot of bad things in the numbers. [SEP] We are pleased with our progress and remain optimistic about the future as we continue to focus on expanding our market share.","2998":"Our quarterly earnings are reflective of the challenging global economic landscape. As we examine our performance by region, we see some regions have been affected more than others. [SEP] The emerging markets that we're seeing pressure in are markets like Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia. [SEP] However, we are seeing growth in other regions such as Southeast Asia and Africa. Moving forward, we will continue to adjust our strategies in response to the fluctuations of these markets. We remain cautiously optimistic about our long-term prospects.","2999":"We have seen strong growth in our installed base over the past year. [SEP] And the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services that are tied to the installed base. [SEP] As our customer needs evolve, we will continue to invest in expanding our data center capacity to meet their demands.","3000":"The question was about the company's recent focus on improving their ad targeting algorithms. [SEP] It's more around just us doing a better job at being able to optimize campaigns for people who have downstream activities that we can do that for. [SEP] We believe that by improving our ability to target specific groups of users, we can deliver better results for our advertisers and ultimately drive more revenue for the company.","3001":"CEO: Now let's move on to discussing our segment performance. \n\nCFO: Before we dive into the numbers, I want to provide some context on how our segments differ in terms of their revenue streams. [SEP] In terms of overall, rough orders of magnitude, the Intelligent Cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business. [SEP] CFO: This means that the Intelligent Cloud segment is less sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand or economic conditions. \n\nCEO: That's good to hear, especially as we navigate through the volatility caused by the pandemic. \n\nAnalyst: Can you provide more detail on what drives the Intelligent Cloud revenue?","3002":"In terms of our cloud offerings, Azure continued to show strong growth this quarter. [SEP] And to your point, we actually saw it this quarter because we again saw a quite good performance in some of these larger long-term Azure contracts which added on a flat expiry base to that 15% bookings growth, which was good. [SEP] Additionally, we are seeing promising signs of adoption in our newer cloud services, particularly in the areas of machine learning and AI.","3003":"We are pleased to report our fourth quarter earnings today. [SEP] Advertising revenue is as a subset been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter. [SEP] This growth can be attributed to strong demand from our advertising partners in various industries.","3004":"We are pleased to report that overall engagement on our messaging platforms has continued to grow steadily, with monthly active users surpassing 2 billion. [SEP] The first thing that we need to do on Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically and build the behavior for people that they reach out to businesses for different things, like customer support or for getting news content, things that may not eventually be the big business use cases but establish the behavior of people interacting not only with their close friends, but also with businesses. [SEP] In the long-term, we see immense potential for businesses to leverage these platforms for advertising and e-commerce, but our immediate focus is on fostering a robust ecosystem of business-to-consumer interactions.","3005":"One of the key aspects of our business model is providing secure computing environments to our customers. [SEP] I think, in general, what we've seen in prior releases is, it does extend a bit past the deadline, especially in our small and mid-sized business customers, and it's really important for us to continue to work hard to have the small and medium businesses find a path forward to make sure they can experience the most secure computing environment we have. [SEP] We understand the challenges that small and medium businesses face when it comes to updating their systems, and we're committed to providing support and guidance as they work to meet the deadlines.","3006":"Our social media platforms have become even more important to people over the past year as they've spent more time at home and gone online for entertainment, connection, and shopping. Today we'll talk about how we're continuing to evolve our services to meet the changing needs of our users and advertisers. [SEP] So in Instagram and Facebook, you have shopping, and you have Marketplace and you have all the tens of millions of small businesses that use pages and a lot that use Instagram for sharing their inventory and being able to help people discover and pay. [SEP] We know that businesses of all sizes are struggling right now, and we want to be a partner in their recovery. That's why we're investing in tools and resources to help them reach new customers and make sales online. We're also working to make our platforms safer and more transparent, with new features like fact-checking and data privacy controls. Overall, we're confident that our strong user engagement and advertising demand will continue to drive growth for the foreseeable future.","3007":"Our Q2 financial results are very encouraging.

[SEP] We are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong revenue growth and increasing shareholder value.","3008":"We've seen a lot of success in our digital marketing efforts. [SEP] That's been a key part of what we've been doing, and that will just continue to be the big driver in the near- and medium-term. [SEP] Of course, we'll also be keeping an eye out for other opportunities for growth and improvement along the way.","3009":"We've been focusing a lot on our product development recently. [SEP] So we are always thinking at least of the technical architecture that makes us unique and differentiated spanning all of it. [SEP] This is something that sets us apart from our competitors and allows us to deliver a superior user experience.","3010":"As we continue to expand our reach and customer base, we are excited to report significant growth in user acquisition. [SEP] We are over $25 million or excuse me, 25 million names (14:02) which is the largest online store in India. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to enhance our product offerings and customer experience in order to maintain our position as the top online retailer in India.","3011":"As we continue to grow our platform, we are also focusing heavily on the user experience and overall engagement. [SEP] And to the extent that there is going be a lot of public content, which there will be, a big part of the focus is going to be around building community and interactions around that content. [SEP] We believe that this emphasis on community and interactions will not only drive user retention and satisfaction but also set us apart from our competitors in the market.","3012":"We launched the new product line two weeks ago and have been closely monitoring its performance. [SEP] But we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response from, again, both customers and sellers. [SEP] We plan to continue to gather feedback and make improvements to ensure sustained success in this area.","3013":"Can you provide some insight into your expected capital expenditures for the next quarter? [SEP] It\u2019s just going to be volatile as CapEx tends to be quarter-to-quarter based on both supply chain and demand. [SEP] However, overall we remain committed to investing heavily in our long-term growth strategy, including research and development and expansion into new markets.","3014":"We have seen tremendous success in our Prime Now service in the United States and other select countries. [SEP] On Prime Now, it is our intent to roll out benefits and functionality globally as quickly as possible. [SEP] Our goal is to make Prime Now a seamless experience for our customers, regardless of where they are located in the world.","3015":"Now turning to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] clearly the commodity environment remains quite favorable, and we continue to expect cost improvements. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made towards achieving our financial goals and are confident in our ability to navigate any potential challenges in the market.","3016":"As for our current challenges, we have some headwinds that we're facing in the short term. [SEP] We have a case right now around memory pricing, which is a headwind for the time being. [SEP] However, we are actively working to mitigate this impact and remain confident in our long-term strategy.","3017":"We've seen a really strong quarter in terms of ad revenue, which I think speaks to the strength of our platform and the engagement of our users. But I wanted to address a question we've gotten a lot lately about the recent increases in ad prices. [SEP] And then on the 35% increases in ad prices, this is really being driven off of a couple things. [SEP] First, there's just a lot of demand for ad space on our platform. Advertisers are seeing great results from their campaigns, which makes them willing to pay more to reach our users. Second, we've made some improvements to our targeting and optimization algorithms that are helping us deliver more effective ads, which in turn allows us to charge more for them.","3018":"I'd like to now discuss our efforts to expand our advertising services and offerings. [SEP] So most of our focus has been on again adding more functionality, adding more products and adding - reporting for businesses and advertisers, so they can understand the incremental customers they're seeing on Amazon through advertising with Amazon. [SEP] Our goal is to provide businesses with the insights and tools they need to optimize their advertising campaigns and drive greater ROI through our platform.","3019":"Moving on to our advertising business, I would like to provide an update on the performance of our Instagram platform. [SEP] On Instagram Feed, which was the second factor, we have seen some increase in ad load on Instagram on a year-over-year basis, but we expect that there'll be less significant growth opportunities going forward on Instagram Feed ad load. [SEP] However, we are focusing on the rollout of new ad formats on Instagram Stories and IGTV, which we believe will provide more growth opportunities for our advertising business in the future.","3020":"We've had a lot of questions lately about our plans for changing the MSI, and I wanted to take this chance to address them head-on. [SEP] When I think about the MSI changes, obviously any change that's beneficial for our community is good for the long run health of our business [SEP] However, we also need to be careful about how we implement these changes and make sure that they don't disrupt the existing ecosystem too much. Ultimately, our goal is to strike a balance that benefits everyone involved - users, contributors, and shareholders alike.","3021":"We've recently launched our new platform that allows developers from all over the world to access our software.\n- Our team has been working hard to promote inclusivity and equity in the tech industry. [SEP] And so we're excited about that because we think it could increase the diversity of the developer community and the quantity. [SEP] Furthermore, we've received positive feedback from developers who are already utilizing our platform.\n- We believe that this increase in diversity will ultimately result in more innovative and creative solutions to common industry challenges.\n- Overall, we're looking forward to seeing the positive impact on our company and the broader tech community as a result of these efforts.","3022":"And now moving on to our financials for the quarter [SEP] Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line. [SEP] This has resulted in a bit of a hit to our revenue this quarter, but we expect to see a positive impact in the long term.","3023":"Our earnings report for this quarter reflects solid growth across our products and services. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our App Store, which continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. [SEP] Also, in China, consistent with the company but at a much different rate, the App Store had a record quarter and grew over 100% year over year. [SEP] We attribute this success to our focus on delivering high-quality, engaging apps to our users, as well as our ongoing collaboration with developers and publishers in China. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our App Store ecosystem and delivering even greater value to our customers around the world.","3024":"We are excited to see the growth and adoption of our Azure platform by businesses all over the world. Our focus remains on providing our customers with the best cloud services to enable them to accelerate their digital transformation. [SEP] The other side of it is the edge, so Azure IOT, our service both in the cloud and the edge and Azure Stack now truly are starting this quarter is going to be another way to extend out the rich services of Azure even beyond public cloud deployment. [SEP] Our Azure IOT service has been gaining momentum and we are seeing increasing demand from customers for edge computing solutions. By extending our services beyond public cloud deployment, we will be able to better serve our customers' needs and help them achieve their business objectives. We are confident that Azure IOT and Azure Stack will continue to drive growth and innovation for Microsoft in the years ahead.","3025":"Looking at our billings team's performance, we've noticed a significant impact from ASC 606 adoption. [SEP] If you could almost take out that 606 impact in the billings team to almost mirror the Microsoft 365 SKUs we sell. [SEP] This has been a challenge for us as our billings are not aligned with the Microsoft 365 SKUs that we offer, and it has affected our overall revenue recognition.","3026":"We've been closely tracking our progress on Instagram Stories and we've seen some encouraging signs. [SEP] In ads in Stories, we rolled out globally about 1.5 years after launching Instagram so it's still early but we're definitely seeing a lot of value for businesses on Instagram, and we believe same on Facebook. [SEP] We're continuing to explore new ways to personalize the ad experience for our users while also delivering more value for our advertisers.","3027":"Our FBA program has continued to see strong growth this quarter. [SEP] It's impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing. [SEP] As more customers sign up for Prime, they tend to utilize the benefits of FBA, which in turn drives further growth in our Prime program.","3028":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] so we're very pleased with the results both in constant currency terms and nominal terms. [SEP] This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team.","3029":"We've been keeping a close eye on our key performance indicators over the past few quarters. One trend that's been particularly noticeable is our clients' increasing reliance on certain programming languages and frameworks. [SEP] The thing that I'm seeing a lot of is we've had traditional strength with SQL as well as .Net. [SEP] In addition to SQL and .Net, we're also seeing a lot of interest in Python and React. This information has been very useful as we continue to refine our development strategy and prioritize new features.","3030":"Can you talk about any technological advancements or changes you've made in your decision-making processes? [SEP] We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into the decisions. [SEP] This shift towards using software and algorithms has resulted in significant cost-savings for the company and has allowed us to streamline our operations.","3031":"I wanted to touch upon our cloud services revenue for the quarter. [SEP] And I\u2019d say the way we think about it is actually more -- we're talking about Azure per user, it really does move more with M365 per user. [SEP] In fact, we've seen strong growth in Azure adoption as companies continue to transition to remote work models and require cloud-based solutions.","3032":"We've noticed a significant increase in engagement on our Stories feature over the past few months [SEP] It\u2019s a little bit different than Feed posts, so comparing apples and oranges a bit. [SEP] However, we believe that both Feed posts and Stories serve an important purpose in our platform and will continue to develop both features.","3033":"We've seen market conditions change quite a bit over the last few quarters. [SEP] So I would say it's not as much of pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed. [SEP] And while there may be some fluctuations in the future, we feel confident in our ability to navigate them and continue to deliver strong results.","3034":"Our goal is to always strive for efficiency in our operations. [SEP] We think it's a similar - we know it's a consistent process and there are times when we under run and sometimes we over run it. [SEP] However, we regularly review our processes to identify areas where we can improve and optimize our performance.","3035":"One analyst asked about the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. [SEP] Yeah, I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win. [SEP] The CEO agreed that cooperation between the two countries was crucial for global economic success, but noted that the current political climate made it difficult to predict future outcomes.","3036":"Moving on to our performance in the Asia-Pacific region. [SEP] And in constant currency terms, we were actually up 6% in mainland China. [SEP] This was driven by strong demand for our products and successful marketing initiatives targeted towards the Chinese market.","3037":"We have seen significant growth in our customer base over the past few quarters, and are pleased with the momentum we are seeing across the business. Our focus on product innovation and customer success is driving strong results. [SEP] So we are starting to get to that point Mark where you have a big base, which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps in the one that you saw this quarter, and your right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter and this one certainly was as well. [SEP] Looking ahead to 2022, we are confident in our ability to continue to drive growth and achieve our strategic objectives. We remain committed to investing in our products, people, and processes to ensure we are well positioned for long-term success.","3038":"We've recently implemented some changes in our business strategy. [SEP] And this is a different approach than we would\u2019ve taken a few years ago, right? [SEP] But we believe this new approach aligns better with our long-term goals and has already shown promising results.","3039":"Our sales team has been working hard to expand our customer base. [SEP] I feel we've got a very broad base of customers from startups to small-medium businesses to large enterprises to the public sector. [SEP] We've also seen growth in international markets, particularly in Asia and Europe.","3040":"We've been receiving a lot of questions about our progress on the new platform we're developing. [SEP] So the first thing that I want to stress here is that these kind of new platforms take a long time to develop [SEP] However, we believe that the investment will be worth it in the end as it will significantly enhance our business capabilities and offerings.","3041":"Thank you for that question. As you know, we launched our new product line last quarter and have seen strong interest in the market. [SEP] But we are still early in the development stage, so it'd be early to be talking about large volume shipments. [SEP] However, we are optimistic about the growth potential and are working diligently to scale up production to meet demand. As we progress, we will keep our shareholders and stakeholders updated on our progress in this area.","3042":"Our quarterly earnings report showed continued growth and success in the market. [SEP] And the number of switchers through the nine months are the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had. [SEP] We are optimistic about the future and believe that our customer acquisition strategy will continue to drive success for the company.","3043":"Our Q4 earnings were very strong, which was largely due to the excellent execution of our team. We are very pleased with the results we achieved during the quarter, and we're looking forward to building on this success in the coming year. [SEP] Number one, the unearned strength that we saw at the end of Q4, you\u2019re right, was very good execution on renewals on a reasonably large renewal base. [SEP] Looking forward, we believe that the strength we saw at the end of Q4 will continue into the first quarter of this year. We have a number of new initiatives in the pipeline that we believe will drive revenue growth, and we're excited to see these projects come to fruition. Overall, we're very optimistic about the future and are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results for our shareholders.","3044":"We are now moving on to discuss our growth strategy and plans for the future. [SEP] Again, we like our position, our industry leading position in the cloud space, and we're working on things that would incent more and more customers to accelerate their cloud conversion. [SEP] We expect the market for cloud services to continue to grow and we believe our innovative solutions and exceptional customer service will keep us at the forefront of this growth. As we continue to make progress in our cloud conversion efforts, we remain confident in the long-term success of our business.","3045":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the usage of our new digital platform. [SEP] But it was coming at the expense of people interacting with each other as much. [SEP] As we move forward, we will continue to find ways to balance the convenience of technology with the importance of human connection and interaction.","3046":"Our latest product release has been generating a lot of buzz in the market. [SEP] We're excited about the number of customers that are trying it and that all the value it offers. [SEP] As a result, we are seeing a significant uptick in our sales pipeline.","3047":"Now let's turn to our analysis of our sales performance in developed markets over the past quarter. [SEP] In developed markets, it is stable and we feel like we're pretty close to saturation in a lot of countries, like the U.S. [SEP] However, we are still exploring potential growth opportunities in emerging markets, where we have seen increasing demand and have been able to establish a strong foothold.","3048":"We've had strong financial performance this quarter, driven by our product innovation and expanded customer base. [SEP] It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that are going through Apple Pay right now and we think ahead for the long term, that could be an interesting business for us as well. [SEP] Additionally, we're continuing to invest in new technologies and partnerships to deepen our presence in emerging markets.","3049":"Moving on to our performance in the e-commerce sector, I'm pleased to report that we've seen significant growth in the past quarter. [SEP] We also launched a new pricing plan which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. and we've expanded, as you know, previously into London. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're planning to further expand our global footprint by entering new markets in Asia and South America.","3050":"Our first question comes from the line of a financial analyst based in New York. [SEP] And so -- and I feel like we are reasonably well positioned in China, I\u2019m sure we can do better, but I think we are doing fairly well there. [SEP] Thank you for your insights. Our next question comes from a journalist based in Beijing.","3051":"We've seen a lot of success with the expansion of Prime into new markets. [SEP] So I would say that we're continuing to frontload Prime benefits in the newer geographies. [SEP] This strategy has resulted in strong growth in membership and higher engagement among our existing customers.","3052":"Now moving on to our digital advertising strategy for our cruise line business. [SEP] So they look for people that at a certain date have used specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button. [SEP] This approach has resulted in a 15% increase in online bookings over the past quarter.","3053":"We're now going to open up the call to questions. [SEP] But at the same time, I think we want to be smart about how many of these phones do we want to generate, how many, which price points we want to participate [SEP] We're currently seeing a shift in the market, with customers increasingly looking for more affordable phone options. We want to make sure that we're catering to this demand while also maintaining the high quality that our customers expect from us. That being said, we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us in the smartphone market and look forward to bringing new and innovative products to market in the coming months and years.","3054":"We've been closely monitoring the impact of ad signal changes on our revenue and performance. As we've previously mentioned, this has been a challenge for us. [SEP] So I don't think anything has changed since Q3 in terms of our outlook on the headwinds that we have around ad signals. [SEP] However, we've been working on developing new strategies to mitigate these headwinds. We're confident that with these efforts, we can continue to grow our business and deliver value to our shareholders.","3055":"We've had a strong quarter in terms of revenue growth and customer acquisition. [SEP] I think with all products, I think about the complete sales cycle and I am really encouraged by the fact that we're doing a good job of moving from the initial sales through deployment, through adding on services and back to renewals and I think the importance of that customer lifecycle is really how we think about our workloads and our workload health in the cloud. [SEP] Our team is dedicating resources to improve the customer experience from start to finish, including better communication and support throughout the sales cycle.","3056":"Let's now move on to our ad revenues for the quarter. [SEP] From the price-volume perspective, yeah, the price per ad increased modestly 3%. [SEP] However, our overall ad impressions decreased by 1%.","3057":"Our third-quarter results have shown a significant increase in sales, especially in the third-party units. We believe this trend will continue in the coming quarters. [SEP] So you'll still see the percentage of third-party units increased and has been steadily over the last few years. [SEP] We are actively working on expanding our partnerships with third-party vendors to provide a wider range of products to our customers. This strategy has proven to be successful in driving sales and increasing our market share.","3058":"We are very pleased to report a 30% increase in revenue for the quarter. [SEP] The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well. [SEP] We plan to invest a significant portion of this increased revenue into further expanding our product offerings and improving our marketing efforts.","3059":"We take a comprehensive approach to evaluate our company's growth and overall health. [SEP] We also look at our pipeline, and we're very excited about what's in our pipeline [SEP] Our team has been diligent in researching and developing new products and services that align with our mission and values.","3060":"We're really seeing two different buying patterns when it comes to our cloud offerings. The first is those that are just starting out, building new products and services, and the second is those that already have a significant investment in on-premise applications and infrastructure. [SEP] If you're starting new, you will have PaaS, which is going to be the first thing you do, but then you'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing, existing data, existing code in a virtual machine. [SEP] That's where our hybrid cloud solutions come in. We make it easy to integrate your on-premise and cloud environments, so you can get the best of both worlds. Our customers are seeing great success with this approach, and we believe it will be a key driver of growth for us going forward.","3061":"We're seeing some really exciting trends in terms of how customers are adopting our technology offerings. There's a growing awareness among business leaders that digital transformation isn't just a nice-to-have - it's absolutely essential for remaining competitive in today's fast-paced marketplace. [SEP] The best way to think about how people are using, whether it's Azure or Dynamics 365 or other capabilities we have, is in the context of that digital transformation and the outcome. [SEP] That's why we're so focused on delivering solutions that help our customers achieve specific outcomes, whether that's improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer experiences, or unlocking new revenue streams. Ultimately, our success is tied to our customers' success, and we're committed to partnering with them every step of the way on their digital transformation journeys.","3062":"Our focus moving forward will be on expanding our services to reach a wider audience. We believe there is a lot of potential in this market, and we are committed to capitalizing on it. [SEP] And we think that we can help drive that and improve people's lives by doing that, so we're absolutely going to go do that. [SEP] We have already developed a roadmap for achieving our goals, and we are working closely with our partners to make it happen. We are confident that with the right strategy and execution, we can make a significant impact on the lives of millions of people.","3063":"Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about the future of our business. [SEP] So I feel we are well positioned to what is going to be a much larger market than what was traditionally gaming, in spite of all the success we\u2019ve had over the years in gaming. [SEP] With our diverse portfolio and innovative strategies, we're confident in our ability to capitalize on new opportunities and drive growth.","3064":"We have been considering expanding into the European market for quite some time now. [SEP] But one of the big things that we need to think about here is, of course, we're only going to do this in a way that we're comfortable with over the long term. [SEP] We have a responsibility to our shareholders to make sustainable decisions that will benefit the company in the long run.","3065":"When asked about funding for the new expansion program in the U.S., the CEO responded. [SEP] We will continue to generate cash in the U.S., but definitely a good portion of the program will be funded through debt. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to manage our debt and maintain a strong financial position.","3066":"One of the things that our company has been monitoring closely is the global economic landscape,\" said the CEO. \"Our products rely heavily on international trade, so we're always keeping a close eye on political and economic relationships between countries. [SEP] And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and I'm actually very optimistic. [SEP] However, there is some uncertainty in the near future with regards to trade agreements and tariffs,\" added the CFO. \"While we remain optimistic, we are also being cautious and taking steps to mitigate any potential risks to our business.","3067":"Now, I'd like to talk a bit about our financial performance this quarter. [SEP] I do believe that the market that which we are operating, the set of assets we've picked, the team we've built, the investments we made in our sales force, even some extent the acquisitions we've done, these are all showing up as top line revenue growth for us. [SEP] As we look ahead to the next quarter, we expect to see further growth and are confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results.","3068":"We've had some really great partnerships over the past year and one of those has been with a company that I really admire. [SEP] So let me also say, after a year of working with them closely, my appreciation and, frankly, a lot of inspiration that I think you've seen in our own product development has been their focus on users and how important it is and how focused they are on it. [SEP] It's really been a pleasure to work with them and I think that we've learned a lot from their approach to user-centered design.","3069":"During the quarter, we saw strong growth in our AWS business. [SEP] And the operational improvements, excuse me, the gross margin, operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have. [SEP] We are confident that our continued focus on operational efficiencies will drive sustained profitability in the future.","3070":"We've seen some changes in the regulatory environment that have prompted us to focus more on privacy. [SEP] And then the third is our own product changes as we put privacy more front and center. [SEP] We're confident that these changes will not only improve the user experience, but also help us maintain long-term trust with our customers.","3071":"Our team has been working hard to innovate and bring new products to the market. [SEP] I look at something like Sway which I\u2019m pretty excited about because basically we\u2019re taking the concept of what is an interactive document and the website and bringing it all together into these Sway documents if you well and if you\u2019re excited about what that could mean in customer service marketing or for school reports. [SEP] We have received positive feedback from our early adopters and are confident in the potential of Sway to become a game-changer in the industry.","3072":"During our last quarter, we focused a lot on improving our user experience and enhancing our product offerings. We've seen a lot of success with this strategy, but we're not done yet. [SEP] So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable and introducing a lot of really new cool new features. [SEP] Our team is dedicated to constantly improving our platform and staying ahead of the game. We believe that by investing in new technologies like AI and the cloud, we can continue to add value for our users and attract new customers. We're excited about the future of our company and we're confident in our ability to deliver innovative solutions that meet the changing needs of our users.","3073":"Our latest product has been well received by our customers and we have seen an increase in demand. It has been exciting to see the positive impact it has had on our business. [SEP] And of course being used together delivered more value to customers and that\u2019s where our competitive advantage comes. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and improve our products, we believe that our competitive advantage will only grow stronger. We remain committed to delivering the best possible experience to our customers and are confident in our ability to do so.","3074":"We've been investing a lot in our messaging products lately, and we've recently made some changes to better align our different messaging services. [SEP] Kind of more like Facebook to the Instagram example that we used before, whereas WhatsApp I think is a much more utilitarian experience with a much more stark UI where there's just not as much emphasis on having a lot of different ways to engage. [SEP] So while WhatsApp remains an incredibly popular app around the world, we think there's still a lot of potential to continue improving the user experience and adding new features to better serve our users.","3075":"Thank you all for joining us on this earnings call. \n2. I'm pleased to report that our company has achieved significant growth this quarter. [SEP] And so hopefully, you see that in the list of things we've launched recently and the continued cadence of making the services we have better. [SEP] We are confident that these recent efforts will position us for even stronger growth and success in the future. \n2. With the market trends and customer needs constantly evolving, we are committed to staying nimble and adapting quickly to deliver what our customers want.","3076":"We have been heavily investing in our Prime offerings to keep up with the growing demand from our customers. [SEP] But principally, what we're trying to do now is \u2013 again, make the Prime experiences as strong as possible for consumers. [SEP] This means improving delivery times, expanding product categories, and enhancing the overall shopping experience through personalized recommendations.","3077":"We're pleased to report that our Prime membership has grown significantly year-over-year, with millions of new members joining in the last quarter alone. [SEP] We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa. [SEP] In addition to FBA, we're also investing in new Prime benefits such as Prime Video and Prime Music to offer a full suite of entertainment options for our members.","3078":"We've talked a lot today about the importance of content in driving engagement and revenue.\n- Our team has been working hard to improve our understanding of the content our users want to see. [SEP] That goes not only for just being able to deliver the content, but being able to understand what it is so we can rank it in News Feed better and show people the right content. [SEP] This has also been a key focus for our AI and machine learning efforts.\n- By improving our ability to understand and rank content, we hope to provide a better experience for our users and improve our advertising offerings.\n- Overall, we're very pleased with the progress we've made in this area, and we believe it will continue to be a key driver of our success going forward.","3079":"Our users have been telling us that they want to see more video content on our platform. [SEP] So we needed to figure out a way so that video can grow, but people can also keep on interacting doing what they tell us that they uniquely want from Facebook. [SEP] After extensive research and testing, we are pleased to announce the launch of our new video feature that allows users to watch and engage with videos while still being able to see their news feed and interact with friends.","3080":"Our social media advertising revenue has continued to grow this quarter, largely driven by the success of our Instagram advertising platform. [SEP] So Instagram ads, now that we've rolled out as we have this past quarter and gotten to a really good product offering, combined the creative format of Instagram which is very visually compelling and has a lot of engagement from people with the back-end infrastructure and marketer base that Facebook has. [SEP] We have seen great success with this strategy and plan to continue to invest in the development and enhancement of Instagram ads in the coming quarters.","3081":"During the last quarter, our impression growth has been quite significant, which is a testament to the strength of our platform. [SEP] So we are seeing more of our impression growth coming from Stories, and when I outlined the factors driving impression growth, I listed Stories first. [SEP] Our team is working hard to continue innovating and improving our Stories feature to maintain its popularity and strong performance.","3082":"We've seen a significant shift in our customer base over the past year. [SEP] In the past we participated, but a lot of Tier 1 workloads were not on Microsoft stack, whereas now, a lot of Tier 1 workloads are in fact increasingly on Microsoft cloud. [SEP] This has been a strategic focus for us, and we're pleased to see it paying off with increased adoption and revenue. Our investments in expanding our cloud capabilities and developing strong partnerships have been key factors in this success.","3083":"During the quarter, we launched a new marketing campaign for our warranty program. We wanted to increase awareness among younger consumers who may not realize they have options when their phone breaks. [SEP] So they targeted 18- to 34-year olds, they did five short videos with these funny moments of where you're about to break your phone, and they got a 6 point lift in awareness of what is a warranty program. [SEP] We're pleased with the initial results and plan to continue targeting this age group with similar campaigns. Overall, our warranty program saw a 12% increase in enrollment during the quarter, with a particular uptick in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic. We believe this is a promising area of growth for our business.","3084":"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings conference call today. [SEP] In terms of the share repurchase authorization, I would just say that we've just about gotten our way through that. [SEP] We have utilized the majority of our share repurchase authorization and will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy going forward.","3085":"Our international sales have shown strong growth, driven by our global selling program. This has been particularly beneficial for our sellers in India. [SEP] We've invested a lot in our global selling program, which helps Indian sellers not only reach customers in India, but also in other geographies around the world. [SEP] We continue to explore opportunities to expand our global selling program and increase its reach. Our goal is to enable sellers to access markets all over the world, while also providing customers with a wide range of high-quality products.","3086":"Moving on to segment performance, let's focus on the Productivity and Business Process segment. [SEP] The Productivity and Business Process segment has a bit more transactional exposure just because it has both the consumer and the commercial Office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs, so it's slightly higher all up. [SEP] However, despite this exposure, the segment has seen steady growth in its subscription-based offerings such as Microsoft 365.","3087":"Now, I'd like to provide an update on our cloud services division. As you all know, we've invested heavily in building out our infrastructure in order to meet the growing demand for cloud computing solutions. [SEP] Overall, what we're seeing is, clearly there is increased usage of infrastructure as a service [SEP] This increased usage is a promising trend for our business, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on it. We continue to innovate and develop new features and services to enhance our cloud offerings and attract more customers. We are confident in our ability to maintain our leadership position in the market and drive continued growth for our shareholders.","3088":"We have been closely monitoring our financials and analyzing market trends over the past quarter. [SEP] And so to us it's sort of within the range and it\u2019s basically when we thought. [SEP] Our team is confident in our ability to continue meeting our targets and driving growth.","3089":"Our advertising revenue has seen significant growth over the last quarter. We've been experimenting with different ad formats to find what works best for our users and our advertisers. [SEP] When we introduce ads into feed and continue to increase the ad load, we monitor really carefully. [SEP] We also gather feedback from our users to ensure that they are not feeling overwhelmed by the ad presence. Our goal is to provide a seamless user experience while still bringing in revenue from advertising.","3090":"In the third quarter, we invested heavily in our advertising campaign to improve brand recognition and reach a larger audience. [SEP] We saw a 14-point lift in ad recall, a seven-point lift in message association. [SEP] These positive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our marketing strategy and indicate a potential for increased sales. Moving forward, we plan to continue investing in advertising to maintain and build on our momentum.","3091":"We are now going to take a question from our analyst, Sarah. [SEP] If you think about it in the client server era we never participated in the core of the digital infrastructure or financial services or in healthcare or in retail or in manufacturing and absolutely when we think about the digital transformational and design wins, deployment, consumption, it's kind of like what we would have done with some ISVs of the past, how we worked perhaps with SAP in the 90s when we were coming out with SQL server and they were coming out with R3 is what we are now doing with many, many, many businesses as they build out their digital businesses. [SEP] So, it's really exciting to see how we are transforming and being a part of these important industries now.","3092":"As we continue to grow our business and expand into new markets, we recognize the importance of strong partnerships and collaboration. [SEP] And so we're investing, and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers' products like Pok\u00e9mon. [SEP] We are excited about the potential for further collaborations and look forward to exploring new opportunities to enhance the user experience for our customers.","3093":"We've been really focused on investing in our cloud capabilities over the past few years. [SEP] So the unique capability we now have in Windows Server, SQL Server is becoming that much more competitive. [SEP] And we're seeing strong demand from enterprise clients who are looking to move their workloads to the cloud.","3094":"As we continue to navigate the ongoing pandemic, I am pleased to report that we are still seeing strong performance in our international markets. Specifically, we have seen impressive results in Europe and Japan, where we have focused our efforts on streamlining operations and cutting costs. [SEP] I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and also things like marketing working to be very efficient. [SEP] However, we are still facing challenges in other regions, particularly in Latin America where we are seeing a more significant impact on our business due to the pandemic. We are closely monitoring the situation and taking all necessary measures to adapt and respond. Overall, we remain optimistic about our ability to navigate these challenges and continue to deliver value to our shareholders.","3095":"Our TV+ product has been gaining popularity in recent months, receiving positive feedback from users. We have been closely monitoring the market trends and we are pleased to see the increasing demand for over the top services. [SEP] The TV+ product plays in a market where it's -- there's a huge move from the cable bundle to over the top. [SEP] As a response to these trends, we are constantly evaluating our TV+ product to ensure that it remains competitive and meets the needs of our users. We are also exploring opportunities to expand our offerings, including potential partnerships and acquisitions. Overall, we are confident in the potential for continued growth in the over the top market and our ability to capture a sizeable share of it with our TV+ product.","3096":"We have seen great success with our recent mobile video ad campaign. [SEP] So it's a really unique combination of the power of creative that was designed for video for mobile with very specific targeting and very specific measurements. [SEP] Our data analysis shows that our targeted approach has resulted in a significant increase in engagement and conversions.","3097":"During this quarter, our team has been focused on developing new products and services to meet the needs of our customers. [SEP] Essentially, there is a new business application like set of services that are getting developed to help people manage their complex IoT application development. [SEP] We believe these new services will differentiate us from our competitors and position us for continued growth in the coming years.","3098":"We've seen a lot of progress in improving our search algorithms to surface more relevant content. [SEP] And then of course, I think that search is often driven by what unique content is in a system and not just the ability to find it. [SEP] That's why we're continuing to invest in creating original and compelling content that our users will love.","3099":"We have recently adopted new accounting standards. [SEP] As part of the adoption, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales. [SEP] This change resulted in an increase in our reported revenue for the current quarter.","3100":"We've received a lot of feedback from our customers about the need to improve our sustainability efforts [SEP] So this is something that we're going to continue engaging in and thinking about, how to move forward on, and long-term it's very important. [SEP] Additionally, we're exploring partnerships with organizations that share our commitment to reducing our environmental impact.","3101":"We are dedicated to growing our revenue and expanding our customer base. We believe that to achieve this, we need to focus on targeted advertising and improving our overall user experience. [SEP] I think the specific ads will be part of how we do that, but it won't be the only way. [SEP] We will also be exploring new partnerships and collaborations to drive growth. Our team is fully committed to finding innovative solutions that will help us meet our goals and achieve long-term success.","3102":"We have noticed some discrepancies in our sales data in the past few months. [SEP] When we tend to have these, we tried to call them out like we did in Q3 leading into Q4. [SEP] This transparency helps us identify potential issues and make adjustments quickly to improve our performance.","3103":"We believe that investment in high-quality programming is essential for the growth and success of our platform. As such, we are committed to providing competitive compensation to content creators and producers who work with us. [SEP] Because a lot of the best episodic content is professionally created, and those folks need to make a good amount of money in order to support their business model. [SEP] However, we also recognize the value of user-generated content and are exploring ways to incentivize and support independent creators. Our goal is to strike a balance between professional and user-generated content that appeals to a wide range of audiences and keeps our platform fresh and engaging.","3104":"We have been focusing on creating a more personalized experience for our users. [SEP] But the top priority right now is just building out the base of organic interaction between people and businesses that they want to interact with. [SEP] In addition to that, we are also exploring new ways to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to further enhance user engagement.","3105":"I'd like to touch on a few accounting changes that we've implemented this year.\n- As many of you know, accounting standards are constantly evolving and changing. [SEP] We did adopt a new standard in January 1 of this year, 2018, and you'll see that reflected in our financials for the first quarter coming up. [SEP] These changes include updates to revenue recognition and lease accounting.\n- While we expect some variability due to these changes, we remain confident in our financial performance for the year.\n- We believe that these changes align our financial reporting more closely with industry best practices and will benefit our stakeholders in the long run.","3106":"Can you provide any updates on the progress of your new product line? [SEP] Right now, we're really just testing and reacting to the customer demand and the customers' preferences and we'll do so for the foreseeable future. [SEP] Are there any plans to expand your product offerings or enter new markets?\"\n\n\"We believe this strategy will allow us to stay agile and adapt quickly to any market changes,\" said the CEO. \"We're also gathering data on customer feedback and using that to make informed decisions about future product development.","3107":"During the previous quarter, we saw tremendous growth in our user base. [SEP] The new services and features last year were over 1,000 versus 700 or so the \u2013 excuse me, in 2015. [SEP] We believe that our focus on innovation and user experience has been a key driver of this growth.","3108":"Our top priority remains to provide an exceptional customer experience through our various offerings. [SEP] We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. [SEP] Additionally, we are actively exploring opportunities to expand our Prime membership benefits to better meet the evolving needs of our customers.","3109":"We\u2019ve been focusing on creating a more streamlined experience for our business users, and I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019ve been making great progress. [SEP] And giving a focused experience for the person who wants to run their business through Facebook and be communicating with their customers all day long, that\u2019s just proven to be an incredibly engaging experience that drives content into the system and is good overall. [SEP] With the addition of new tools and features, we\u2019re seeing more and more businesses turn to Facebook as their primary platform for customer communication and engagement.","3110":"Our focus this quarter has been on understanding the trends in the technology industry and positioning ourselves for the future. [SEP] Whether it's IoT, whether it's the auto industry, whether it's what's happening in retail, essentially compute is going where the data gets generated, and increasingly data is getting generated at the volumes in which it's drawing compute to it, which is the edge. [SEP] As a result, we have been investing heavily in our edge computing solutions, which we believe will be vital to our success in the coming years.","3111":"We're now going to take a question from one of our analysts on the line. [SEP] And really when you look around the world, it's really if you exclude China, essentially every single currency has weakened against the dollar. [SEP] How do you think this will impact our earnings going forward?","3112":"Our results this quarter have been exceptional, driven by strong sales across all of our regions. We are pleased to report a 28% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year. [SEP] And I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that for an average weekly sales basis, it\u2019s actually 22%. [SEP] This growth is a testament to the hard work of our teams and our commitment to delivering value to our customers. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our prospects and expect to see continued growth in the coming quarters. Thank you all for joining us on this call and for your continued support of our business.","3113":"Thank you for joining our earnings conference call today. We are pleased to report our financial results for the second quarter of the year, which are in line with our expectations. [SEP] We are right now, the second half of this year looks like a big step-up compared to the first half and it is. [SEP] This step-up is primarily due to several factors, including the launch of new product lines, an increase in demand from existing customers, and the successful implementation of cost-saving measures. We remain optimistic about our business prospects for the remainder of the year and expect to deliver strong financial performance. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our company.","3114":"We are seeing strong growth in our latest product line. [SEP] And so it does seem to me there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market well and I think if we put our emphasis there, which we're doing, that will be a beneficiary of that as other people will as well. [SEP] Our team is working hard to innovate and bring new offerings to the market to capitalize on this opportunity.","3115":"We have seen a significant increase in customer retention over the past quarter. [SEP] So I associate it, yes, with lifetime value, and I also associate it with our ability to move our gross margin percentage up. [SEP] Therefore, we plan to invest heavily in customer acquisition and retention strategies to continue driving our lifetime value and gross margin percentage.","3116":"Investor: \"Can you provide some clarity on your strategy regarding vendor relationships versus merchant relationships? And also, can you speak to any plans to shift your focus from 1P to 3P sales?\"\n\nCEO: \"Sure, happy to address that. What specifically would you like me to touch on? [SEP] On your comment, I assume you meant vendors not merchants, but on the move from 1P to 3P, but no there shouldn't be -- I can't highlight anything related shifting in channel there, but I would say that we remain in different on whether -- we're focused on price convenience and selection for our customers. [SEP] Investor: \"Understood, thank you for that clarification. And regarding your competition, how do you differentiate yourselves in the market?\"\n\nCEO: \"As I mentioned earlier, our focus on price, convenience, and selection sets us apart. We are constantly striving to improve in those areas and provide the best shopping experience for our customers.","3117":"We are pleased to report that our advertising revenue has continued to grow quarter over quarter. [SEP] Ads for us is a very natural fit for our business, and we have a lot of runway ahead of us. [SEP] Our team is constantly innovating and exploring new ways to improve targeting and engagement for our advertising partners.","3118":"A question came in from an analyst on the line asking about the success of the iPhone X launch. [SEP] And, but I think for us, the thing that we always have to do is come out with a really great innovative product, and I think that iPhone X shows that when you deliver a great innovative product, there's enough people there that would like that and it can be a really good business, and so that's how to look at that. [SEP] We're always trying to innovate and bring out the next big thing that will excite our customers and bring them value.","3119":"The next question comes from a reporter from CNBC. [SEP] Right now, the big theme and strategy that we're executing is we're going to become video first. [SEP] Can you talk more about what \"video first\" means for the company and how it will impact revenue?","3120":"Can you give us an update on your expected expenses for the upcoming quarter? [SEP] We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. [SEP] However, we will continue to monitor our expenses and adjust our accruals accordingly to mitigate any financial risks.","3121":"We have seen significant growth in our commercial sector over the past year. [SEP] And to your second question, most of these larger contracts are showing up in that commercial bookings number, and we referenced that on these -- when we say the longer -- larger, longer-term contracts, that is where they show up. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue as we pursue additional long-term contracts with our commercial partners.","3122":"We have received a lot of positive feedback about our new product launches and initiatives, and we're excited about the future growth potential. [SEP] As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of and bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. [SEP] One area where we're seeing particularly strong growth is in our digital sales channels, which are becoming an increasingly important part of our overall strategy.","3123":"Our company has seen strong sales growth this quarter, particularly in our smartphone division. [SEP] And trade-in as a percentage of their total sales is significant and financing is a key element of it. [SEP] In order to capitalize on this trend and continue our success, we plan to invest heavily in our financing and trade-in programs to further incentivize our customers.","3124":"We have seen a steady growth in our revenue and profits over the past few quarters. [SEP] So, I think from a secular trend point of view, we\u2019re very well-positioned, but obviously we\u2019ll continue to monitor the macro conditions and currency. [SEP] Despite these external factors, we remain confident in our ability to meet our financial targets for the year.","3125":"With the launch of our new products, we have seen a surge in demand from customers who were previously using competitor devices. [SEP] And we think this provides us a great opportunity to win over some of those customers into the Apple ecosystem. [SEP] Our marketing team is working diligently to create campaigns that highlight the unique benefits of being a part of the Apple ecosystem and we are confident that it will resonate with customers.","3126":"Now let's talk about the impact of currency exchange rates on our business. [SEP] At a macro level, because about two-thirds of our company is outside the United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins; a strong dollar, as it's been during the last four years, has been a bit of a headwind for the company. [SEP] However, we do recognize that currency fluctuations can be unpredictable and we continually monitor the situation to ensure we are well-positioned to navigate any changes.","3127":"Now, let's talk about our product portfolio and the impact it is having on our customer base. [SEP] The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform with an incredible product that is at a new price point for us with the latest technology, and so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. [SEP] We are also exploring new markets where the iPhone SE can be particularly appealing, such as emerging markets or customers who are looking for a more affordable option.","3128":"Thank you for joining the earnings conference call today. [SEP] As I said in my opening remarks, that has increased or we've observed increases in some types of sharing and interaction between people based on that. [SEP] This has led to higher engagement levels within our platform and we are excited to continue to foster these connections between users.","3129":"Moving on to our e-commerce segment, I'd like to share some updates on our Prime Now service. [SEP] We're very happy with their order patterns from Prime Now, and very happy with it. [SEP] This has led to increased fulfillment efficiency and better customer satisfaction, as we're able to deliver products to their doorsteps in record time.","3130":"We saw strong demand for our wearables, with revenue from this category reaching a new all-time high. [SEP] And as I've mentioned before, 3 out of 4 customers buying an Apple Watch currently or last quarter I should say were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. [SEP] This is a testament to the appeal of the Apple Watch to a wide range of consumers and the success of our marketing efforts.","3131":"Now let's turn to our product performance over the past year. [SEP] So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw last year. [SEP] Looking ahead, however, we anticipate a shift toward higher ASP products as we focus on expanding our premium offerings.","3132":"Now turning to our current financial situation. [SEP] We are paying some tariffs today as you know, some that went into effect pre-September, and some others that went into effect in September. [SEP] However, we have been actively managing our supply chain and exploring alternative sourcing options to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business.","3133":"We've been thinking about how we can expand our offerings and differentiate ourselves from our competitors in the market. [SEP] As opposed to driving our own top line\/bottom line growth, I think we can bring real innovation, and that's what is exciting to see. [SEP] Our R&D team has been working hard to develop new products and services that will meet the changing needs of our customers and provide them with real value.","3134":"Our product mix has been a key driver of our growth over the past few quarters. As we continue to expand into new markets and introduce new products, we anticipate that we'll see some fluctuations in that mix. [SEP] But the mix will also shift each quarter, just because the mix is not a stable mix. [SEP] That being said, we're confident in our ability to adapt and react to those changes. We've invested heavily in data analytics to help us better understand customer preferences and trends, and we're constantly tweaking our product lineup to stay ahead of the curve.","3135":"We have seen strong revenue growth in our advertising business over the past quarter. [SEP] Feed from a growth perspective on an impression front is more constrained given where we are with ad loads on Facebook and Instagram. [SEP] However, we are still focused on expanding our user base and increasing engagement to drive future growth.","3136":"We have seen an increasing number of companies utilizing our Dynamics 365 platform to optimize their operations. [SEP] In the case of Maersk, they were using field service and operations inside of Dynamics 365. [SEP] Maersk reported significant improvements in efficiency and cost savings since implementing Dynamics 365 for their field service and operations.","3137":"Our focus this quarter has been on expanding our reach and bringing our products to new regions. We're pleased to report that we've successfully opened up a new branch in Mumbai. [SEP] We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. [SEP] We've seen a significant increase in customer engagement in Mumbai, which we attribute to our expanded presence in the region. Looking ahead, we plan to continue exploring new opportunities for growth and expansion.","3138":"We have been investing heavily in improving our ad quality and optimizing our sales and marketing approach. [SEP] You're going to have some of the ads work that we're doing, the ads quality work showing up in the sales and marketing line, so you're going to see some there. [SEP] Our sales team is also working hard to drive growth and expand our customer base, which we believe will lead to strong results in the coming quarters.","3139":"Our company has experienced significant growth in the past quarter, with revenue increasing by 23% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] The current market of trying to help people share and experience all these shorter form clips is massive. [SEP] As a result, we have been aggressively investing in our technology to improve the user experience and capture a larger share of this rapidly expanding market.","3140":"Can you elaborate on how your company's diversified business model impacts financial performance and what sets it apart from competitors? [SEP] And there will be changes in seasonality from quarter to quarter, but structurally those two things, the diversity of what we are doing and how capital is utilized across all of it is I think a big structural differentiator for us. [SEP] How will you continue to prioritize and allocate capital across these diverse business areas in the coming year?","3141":"Our team has been working tirelessly to integrate advanced AI technologies into our software. [SEP] Part of the advance in AI technology now allows us to use more compute to use all the data that's in the system to provide better results [SEP] As a result, we have seen significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of our data analysis, leading to a better user experience for our customers.","3142":"Now, moving on to our investments. Let's start with infrastructure. As you all know, it's a critical component of our business and we are constantly investing in it to drive our growth. [SEP] We had a -- we've come off a period where if you remember last year we had less investment needed in infrastructure both for AWS and for Amazon in total. [SEP] However, this year we ramped up our investment in both areas as we continue to expand and enhance our capabilities. We believe it's important to stay ahead of the curve and invest aggressively in infrastructure to support our long-term growth and customer needs.","3143":"We are pleased to announce our sales results for the last quarter. [SEP] In Urban China and the U.S., the top five smartphones last quarter were all iPhones. [SEP] This demonstrates the continued strength and popularity of the iPhone in these important markets.","3144":"Investor: Can you give us an update on the progress of your company\u2019s build-out?\nCEO: Sure, Heather. We\u2019ve been working hard on expanding our facilities and infrastructure. [SEP] When it comes to our build out, Heather, I tend to think two components. [SEP] CEO: The first component is physical infrastructure. We\u2019ve been investing in new manufacturing sites, warehouses, and distribution centers to improve our capacity and efficiency. \nThe second component is digital infrastructure. We\u2019ve been enhancing our online platforms and systems to better serve our customers and optimize our operations.","3145":"As we continue to grow our user base and develop our technology, one of our key priorities is to create more value for content creators on our platform. [SEP] We're going to be investing in content to help build a platform for content producers to find an audience and monetize. [SEP] We believe that by providing more opportunities for content producers to reach their audience and generate revenue, we can create a more sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem for everyone involved.","3146":"Our company has been studying consumer behavior patterns in terms of media consumption. [SEP] That's very different from saying, hey, I want to watch video content now. [SEP] As a result of our research, we have discovered that consumers often have a specific intention when engaging with different types of media.","3147":"One area of growth that we are particularly excited about is our Watch feature. [SEP] But as Watch has grown, it has proven to us that that these sub-experiences as part of our different apps, similar with IGTV, can be quite successful. [SEP] We plan to continue investing in these sub-experiences to provide even more value to our users and drive revenue growth. We believe that this approach has the potential to be a significant driver of our future success.","3148":"In terms of expenses, we have managed to keep costs under control and have continued to invest in areas that we believe will drive long-term growth. Our operating expenses (OpEx) for the December quarter were slightly higher than the previous year, primarily due to increased investment in R&D and marketing. [SEP] And from what you\u2019ve seen from our guidance for the March quarter, we\u2019re guiding to a growth in OpEx on a year-over-year basis that is similar to what we\u2019ve experienced during the course of the December quarter. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to balance our investments with cost management and deliver strong financial results. We expect to see continued growth in revenue as we expand into new markets and further penetrate existing ones. Overall, we're pleased with our performance and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.","3149":"One of the questions that we've been getting is, are we focused on private Cloud or public Cloud or both? [SEP] But quite frankly if you sort of looked at what\u2019s broadly happening in the Cloud transition, we are participating in both the private hybrid Cloud as well as the public Cloud. [SEP] So I think we're pretty well positioned as we move into 2021 to continue to take advantage of that trend.","3150":"We have been using various methods to track user engagement on our platform. [SEP] because we believe that we can get an accurate signal from the community then \u2013 people are smart. [SEP] Therefore, we are committed to continuing to listen to and engage with our community to make sure we are meeting their needs and delivering value.","3151":"We're now going to talk about our video streaming service, Prime Video. [SEP] So on Prime Video, again we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know the customers love it. [SEP] In fact, we've been seeing a significant increase in the number of hours streamed on Prime Video, which is a testament to its popularity.","3152":"Can you provide some insight into the growth strategy for the company going forward? [SEP] And so, we're focusing on products and services and there will be some services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period sales mostly, very much services are rarely connected on that today or at least not a high percentage by any means there. [SEP] But as we continue to invest in these services and build out our offerings, we anticipate seeing a positive impact on overall revenue in the long term.","3153":"We've been exploring different avenues for expansion and growth, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. However, we recognize the importance of being strategic in our approach. [SEP] So I won't shy away from it because what's important to us is growth in areas where we have something unique to contribute and long-term profitability. [SEP] We've identified several key areas where we feel we can make a real difference, and we're investing heavily in those areas. At the same time, we're also being mindful of our long-term profitability goals and making sure that we're not sacrificing that for short-term gains.","3154":"Now moving on to our pricing strategy for the quarter. [SEP] So, so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. [SEP] We believe this will not only attract new customers but also retain our existing ones while increasing our overall market share.","3155":"As we dive into the data from the last quarter, we can see some really promising trends. [SEP] So that's the first thing that we're seeing is increased usage of our servers with the cloud component. [SEP] And this is just the beginning - we're investing heavily in improving our cloud infrastructure to meet the growing demand.","3156":"We had a strong quarter with revenue growth across all segments. [SEP] So it's a \u2013 there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer-term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in our warehouse networks. [SEP] Additionally, we are continuing to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings and stay ahead of market trends.","3157":"Our retail store strategy has continued to be a significant growth driver for us. We\u2019ve opened several new locations and have seen strong sales growth across our existing stores. [SEP] Three, our trade-in and financing programs that we\u2019ve implemented in our retail stores have been very well received there, and I'm happy with the results to date there. [SEP] Moving forward, we plan to continue investing in our retail store experience, expanding our product offerings and further improving our trade-in and financing programs. Our goal is to make it even easier for customers to upgrade to the latest technology and enhance their overall shopping experience with us.","3158":"Now I want to talk about our recent initiatives in live video. As you know, video has become a more important part of our platform over the past few years, and we're committed to investing in it as a way to engage our user base. [SEP] So live video we think represents an example of something new, which is video which is a medium for doing something that's really interacting with other people. [SEP] We've seen some great results with live video so far, with engagement rates increasing and users spending more time on our platform. Looking ahead, we plan to continue experimenting with different types of live content and finding ways to make it even more interactive. Overall, we see live video as a key part of our strategy for building a more engaging and immersive user experience.","3159":"Our focus on delivering high-quality content to our customers remains a top priority. [SEP] We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. [SEP] This increased investment in content is anticipated to drive sustained growth and engagement across our platform.","3160":"Our team has been working hard on streamlining our processes to ensure we can meet the increased demand. [SEP] That bodes very well for our business because we think we can do that very efficiently. [SEP] Additionally, we're excited to announce a new partnership that will help us expand our reach and capture even more market share.","3161":"We have noted a significant increase in user engagement on our platform. One of the primary reasons for this is the introduction of native ads. [SEP] They are native format, so they decrease that initial drop-off you see when people click off to another site. [SEP] By using native ads, we have been able to improve the overall user experience on our platform. This has resulted in a longer duration of time spent on our website by our users, which has contributed to increased revenue for the company.","3162":"Moving on to our cloud division, Amazon Web Services or AWS, I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong performance. [SEP] And so, on the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have. [SEP] We're also allocating resources towards developing new services and features to better serve the evolving needs of our customers.","3163":"Our political consulting firm has been working hard to improve our techniques and strategies. [SEP] And because of the successful results that we've seen in a number of elections recently, we feel like our road map and our level of preparation is much higher now than it has been. [SEP] We're confident that these developments will allow us to continue to make a significant impact in future elections.","3164":"When it comes to pricing our products, we always keep our customers' satisfaction and their desire for the latest technology in mind. [SEP] We price for the value that we're delivering, and iPhone X is the most innovative product on the market. [SEP] Our commitment to innovation will always be a core part of our strategy, and we look forward to bringing even more game-changing products to market.","3165":"We have seen strong growth in our business and are continuing to invest in our team to support that growth. [SEP] So on the OpEx guide, clearly the biggest driver there is going to be the accelerating head count growth. [SEP] We believe that the additional investment in head count will drive further growth and expansion opportunities in the future.","3166":"Looking ahead to our second quarter projections... [SEP] We'll have some costs in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. [SEP] However, we expect these costs to be offset by increased sales and revenue during Prime Day.","3167":"We believe that our platform has a responsibility to not only connect our users with goods and services, but also to contribute to the greater good. [SEP] but also about helping people when they're in need on the platform, and we take that very, very seriously. [SEP] That's why we've implemented a number of safety measures and support services to ensure that our users feel safe and secure when using our platform.","3168":"Can you talk a bit about your capital expenditure plans for the next year? [SEP] But obviously we are investing in the business and we will never under invest in the business. [SEP] So despite the short-term impact on profitability, we believe these investments will drive long-term growth for our company.","3169":"We had a challenging year, but we are grateful to report that our company has shown resilience and strength amidst the global pandemic. I would now like to provide an overview of our financial performance and share some insights about our company's future.

Overall, while the road ahead may still be bumpy, I am confident in our company's ability to navigate through it and emerge stronger than ever.","3170":"Can you discuss the adoption rates of your various product offerings in the market? [SEP] People start using E1 then they use E3 and then you start to see the momentum in E5, and we did see that. [SEP] What steps are you taking to continue driving adoption and increasing revenue from these products?","3171":"Our technology team has been working tirelessly to ensure that we stay ahead of the curve when it comes to providing our customers with the latest cutting-edge solutions. As part of our effort to transform our business model and drive growth, we've been investing heavily in Big Data technology. [SEP] because our people started building their mobile back end, web back end using Big Data not workloads we have. [SEP] This investment has paid off handsomely, as we've seen a significant increase in our customer base and revenues. Our ability to quickly process and analyze data in real-time has given us a major competitive advantage. Going forward, we will continue investing in Big Data and other advanced technologies to ensure that we stay at the forefront of our industry and continue to provide unparalleled service to our customers.","3172":"Now turning to our sales performance during the holiday season. [SEP] And we do see obviously spikes in Black Friday and Cyber Monday and we also see relative tick-up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and for the shipping threshold cutoff. [SEP] Overall, we were pleased with our sales performance during the fourth quarter.","3173":"We believe that innovation is key to staying ahead of the competition, and so we are committed to allocating resources towards research and development. [SEP] And so we're very much, we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the R&D spend increasing. [SEP] We are excited about the potential breakthroughs that could come out of our increased R&D spend, and we believe that they will ultimately drive long-term value for our shareholders.","3174":"We've had a lot of questions from investors about our long-term strategy for our cloud services. [SEP] So I think the mix of our gross, or rather that mix will define our long-term gross margin and operating margin for our cloud services. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to adjust our pricing and offerings based on feedback from our customers and changes in the market.","3175":"Our company has experienced significant growth over the past year and a half. [SEP] What we're focused on doing is providing more higher quality services for free than what you could otherwise get in paying for them. [SEP] By offering these high-quality services for free, we hope to increase customer loyalty and attract new users to our platform.","3176":"Our messaging platform has seen tremendous growth over the past year, with millions of people using it to connect with their friends and family. [SEP] The biggest strategic thing that we really need to do in messaging right now is make it so that people organically interact with businesses and that that is a good interaction both for people and for the businesses. [SEP] We believe that the key to achieving this goal is through personalized messaging experiences that allow businesses to engage with their customers in a meaningful way.","3177":"We're now going to take questions from our investors and analysts. [SEP] Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was \u2013 grew 51% year-over-year. [SEP] However, we believe this investment is necessary to improve our delivery times and customer experience.","3178":"When asked about how the company approaches content moderation, CEO John Smith responded [SEP] We don't actually look at the photo and deeply understand what's in it or look at the videos and understand what's in it or read the links that people share and understand what's in them, but in the future we'll be able to, I think in a five or 10-year period. [SEP] However, for now, we rely on our algorithms and community standards to flag and remove any content that violates our policies. In the meantime, we are constantly investing in research and development to improve our technology and ensure a safe and secure platform for our users.","3179":"During the past quarter, we have been experiencing some challenges in our daily operations due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, we have been able to adapt and implement mitigation measures to maintain our market position. [SEP] We're very pleased with the results we're seeing on the top and bottom line, but margins are going to be bumpy and affected by levels of investing, price reductions and also cost efficiencies that we're driving. [SEP] In addition, we are currently working on expanding our product lines to broaden our customer base, which will require some level of investment. Nevertheless, we are confident that this strategy will result in increased revenue streams in the long run. Overall, we remain optimistic about our prospects and look forward to a successful year ahead.","3180":"We've been investing heavily in expanding our internet infrastructure in underserved communities around the world. We wanted to analyze the impact of our efforts on poverty and job creation. [SEP] So what we find through the research is that for every 10 people who get connected to the Internet, just a little less than or right around one person gets lifted out of poverty and one new job gets created.

As we continue to invest in this area, we look forward to tracking and sharing the results of our ongoing research.","3181":"We have some exciting updates to share about our search engine division.

We plan to invest further in this market as we see significant potential for growth in the coming years.","3184":"Now I would like to discuss our recent product updates and how they will affect our performance metrics.

[SEP] In addition, we've done a lot of hard engineering work I believe over the past six quarters to be able to take advantage of more utilization and capacity over time and I'll let Satya maybe add a little bit technically. [SEP] Satya, as our Chief Technology Officer, has been instrumental in leading our engineering efforts and ensuring that our infrastructure is scalable and adaptable to new market demands.","3186":"Looking ahead to the next quarter, we've identified some key areas where we need to increase our spending.

[SEP] Fortunately, we believe that these investments will pay off in the long run and help us stay ahead of the competition.","3187":"During the earnings conference call, the company's executives were discussing the growth and potential of their video content platform, Watch. [SEP] We think that the more money that creators can make through Watch, there will be a virtuous cycle there. [SEP] We've seen some great success with our ad revenue sharing model for creators on Watch,\" the executive continued. \"And as we continue to invest in the platform and its features, we believe that more creators will find success and attract even larger audiences.

It's a win-win for everyone involved.","3188":"During the Q&A session, an investor asked about the company's plans for expansion in Asia. [SEP] So as I've said a number of times before, our mission is to connect everyone in the world, and it's hard to do that over the long term if we don't find a way to serve more than a billion people who live in China [SEP] Our team is currently working on strategies to enter the Chinese market, and we are optimistic about the potential for growth in this region.","3189":"During this quarter, we saw a significant increase in iPhone sales in emerging markets. [SEP] We are very focused on growing iPhone around the world, not just in one geography and getting our message out there through ads is one way to do that. [SEP] In addition to advertising, we are also increasing our presence in retail stores and partnering with local carriers to expand our reach in these regions.","3190":"We have been working hard to improve the user experience on our platform, and one area that we have been focusing on is our content distribution algorithm.

[SEP] It's not like you have to search one-day shipping specifically to find out what's available.

[SEP] And how are you adjusting your strategies in these regions to optimize user growth and revenue opportunities?","3196":"I'd like to talk a little bit about our brick-and-mortar retail strategy. [SEP] As you may know, we have three physical bookstores, one Seattle, one in San Diego and one in Portland and two more coming, one in Boston and one in Chicago. [SEP] These stores have become a valuable asset to our brand, showcasing our products and providing a unique in-person shopping experience for our customers.","3197":"We're continuing to invest heavily in our cloud infrastructure to support the increasing demand for data processing and storage. Our goal is to provide our customers with a seamless and scalable experience that can handle their growing data needs.

We've already seen success with this strategy, as our cloud platform has seen significant growth in usage and revenue.

We are confident in the potential of this platform and will continue to invest in and grow our grocery business to better meet customer demand.","3201":"We've seen some strong performance in our advertising business over the past few quarters. [SEP] And that's going to be particularly pronounced as we get into the second half of 2017 because ad load will be a less significant factor driving growth starting in the second half. [SEP] Instead, we're going to focus on improving the quality of our ads and increasing our user engagement metrics.","3202":"Now I want to shift the discussion to our marketing strategy and growth potential. As you all know, our platform is built to help businesses of all sizes reach their target audience and achieve their advertising goals. [SEP] When you think about our marketer growth, I think we have an ability to grow both the number of advertisers who use our platform, but also the percentage of their business that we get. [SEP] We have been investing heavily in our sales and marketing teams to drive advertiser acquisition and retention. Additionally, we are constantly improving our technology and targeting capabilities to offer a seamless advertising experience for our customers. With all these efforts, we are confident in our ability to continue growing our market share and driving long-term value for both advertisers and shareholders.","3203":"So, as we continue to build our platform, we're really focused on breaking down these barriers and enabling people to share and express themselves freely. [SEP] And the idea is that there are all these different barriers that any given person has to being able to share and express everything that they want, from technical barriers, it's really hard to communicate with someone if you're not on the internet and they're far away, to product barriers, it's hard to share videos if we don't have a good product for sharing videos, to legal barriers, it's hard to share content that your government says is illegal for you to share. [SEP] We believe that the more we can create a truly open and accessible platform, the more we can empower people around the world to connect with each other and to share their stories and experiences.","3204":"Moving onto our brick and mortar presence, I'd like to provide an update on our physical stores revenue for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. As you know, our physical stores have been impacted by the ongoing pandemic and the shift towards online shopping. [SEP] In our physical stores, it feels there are supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. [SEP] However, we are pleased to report that despite these challenges, our physical stores revenue exceeded our expectations. We saw strong sales at our Whole Foods locations, as well as increased foot traffic at some of our other stores due to the easing of lockdown restrictions. We remain committed to the growth and improvement of our physical retail presence as we continue to adapt to the ever-changing retail landscape.","3205":"We've seen incredible growth in our Alexa devices sales this quarter, with Echo Dot being the best-selling product. [SEP] And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa into their products, which then creates a great network effect. [SEP] We're excited to see the continued adoption of Alexa Voice Service among developers, and we believe this will drive even more innovation and growth for our Alexa ecosystem.","3206":"Our team has been closely monitoring the shift in consumer behavior towards passive consumption. With the rise of online streaming services and social media, we've observed a decline in active engagement and interaction between users. [SEP] And I do think that that is likely going to continue this trend of decreasing passive consumption, but if we do our jobs well, it should increase the number of meaningful interactions that people have. [SEP] Our goal is to create content that not only informs and entertains, but also fosters genuine connection between individuals. We believe that by prioritizing quality over quantity, we can inspire our audience to engage in more meaningful conversations and build stronger communities.","3207":"Now I'd like to discuss our inventory levels and in-stock position since the acquisition. [SEP] We've made no changes post acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in stock, except perhaps the fact that the price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. [SEP] Overall, we remain optimistic about our ability to maintain strong in-stock levels in the coming quarters, despite the challenges presented by supply chain disruptions and ongoing demand fluctuations.","3208":"We're excited to announce that we've recently expanded our production facilities. [SEP] This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers, and we think it makes sense over the long-term. [SEP] Additionally, with this extra capacity, we're able to entertain larger orders from potential customers, allowing for potential growth in revenue.","3209":"During the Q&A portion of the call, an analyst asked about the company's stance on mergers and acquisitions. [SEP] When it comes to our appetite for M&A, actually it has remained unchanged, which is when things meet our criteria and when we feel like it's in core areas for us, where markets are expanding, where the companies have a unique asset, I think that our ability to both execute on those and see them both execute on their own and execute inside Microsoft, I actually feel quite good that we don't worry about our ability to do them, but I wouldn't say that's new this quarter. [SEP] Overall, we believe that M&A can be a key driver of growth for our company and we remain open to exploring potential opportunities.","3210":"We've seen strong growth in our Prime membership base and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. [SEP] And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for us [SEP] Another area of focus is improving the customer experience, which includes fast and reliable delivery times. We believe our investments in Fulfillment by Amazon will help us achieve this goal.","3211":"Now moving on to our cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services or AWS. [SEP] On AWS revenue, let me just remind you that quarterly growth last year on an FX-neutral basis, so Q1 was 48%, then 49%, then 46% and 46%. [SEP] We are thrilled to report that the momentum has continued this year with FX-neutral growth rates of 54%, 49%, and 47% for Q1, Q2, and Q3 respectively. Our team has been working hard to add new services, features, and regions to AWS to better serve our customers and we believe that our continued investment in this area is paying off. Overall, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of AWS and we are committed to investing in the necessary resources to maintain our leadership position in the market.","3212":"Our latest product release has been received positively in the market and has garnered immense interest among our customers. We have been constantly listening to our customers' feedback and working on incorporating their suggestions in our products to make them more efficient and user-friendly. [SEP] I mean that service with full compatibility with SQL Server is a fantastic value proposition for our customers who have huge estates whether it's the Data Warehouse that's become very, very competitive, the Data Lake. [SEP] Additionally, our team has been working on enhancing our customer support by implementing new tools and processes to provide proactive assistance. We believe that our continued focus on innovation and customer-centricity will enable us to maintain our leadership position in the market.","3213":"I'd like to take a moment to recognize the strong leadership we have at the executive level.

[SEP] Their strategic planning has been instrumental in our company's recent success and I have no doubt it will continue to propel us forward.","3214":"In response to a question on the current state of the company's supply chain. [SEP] And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. [SEP] However, we are actively working to mitigate the impact and are exploring alternative sources for our materials.","3215":"Now turning to our strategy for the next quarter. [SEP] We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward. [SEP] We have several exciting new projects in the pipeline that we believe will continue to drive growth and strengthen our position in the market.","3216":"Our company has been heavily investing in virtual reality technology for the past few years and we are beginning to see some interesting developments. [SEP] For the first few years of virtual reality, I think gaming and video are going to be the big ones. [SEP] However, we do believe that in the long term, virtual reality has the potential to revolutionize many other industries such as healthcare, education, and tourism. We are excited to continue exploring these possibilities.","3217":"We've been working hard to grow our business and expand our offerings.

[SEP] We're excited about the opportunities for further growth as we continue to innovate and serve our customers.","3218":"We are thrilled to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and record profits. [SEP] And I would just add that as we think about that long-term trajectory, our ability to continue to improve margins in our SaaS portfolio and our PaaS portfolio and IaaS portfolio still exists. [SEP] Our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction remains a top priority, and we are confident in our ability to continue delivering value to our clients.","3219":"We've been investing heavily in our messaging platform and are excited about the new features we're rolling out. [SEP] So when you think about the types of products that we're building on messaging, where encryption is going to play a huge role, sharing with your friends, where Stories, which is ephemeral, is the main thing that's growing. [SEP] Our user research shows that people want more private and secure ways to communicate, and we believe encryption is the key to achieving that.","3220":"Our advertising campaigns have been incredibly successful this quarter. We've seen a significant increase in traffic to our website and higher conversions than we anticipated. [SEP] And I think a lot of those were discovered and purchased right through that advertising funnel. [SEP] Going forward, we plan to continue leveraging the advertising funnel to drive new customer acquisition. In fact, we're already planning some new campaigns to tap into previously untapped markets.","3221":"We're thrilled to share with you our latest achievements and milestones. Our team has been working hard to create successful campaigns and strategies that have resulted in remarkable outcomes. [SEP] They got an 89% increase in brand awareness and a 20% lift in sales.

We're excited to continue building on this momentum and delivering even greater value to our customers and stakeholders. Thank you for your continued support.","3222":"Our company has been experiencing strong growth in the past year and we are confident in our continued success moving forward. [SEP] And there's a strong technological underpinning for that, which is that if you go back five years and you tried to watch a video on your phone, it would probably have to buffer for a minute or so before you'd actually get to watch it, which wasn't a good experience. [SEP] But now with the 5G technology becoming increasingly available, we're able to offer high-quality video streaming on mobile devices without any buffering, which has greatly improved the customer experience. This has contributed to our success in retaining and attracting new customers.","3223":"Our customers have been consistently asking for more advanced features and options, and we've taken steps to deliver on those demands. [SEP] They have the capability of upgrading on a more consistent basis using more of these premium services. [SEP] We believe that investing in these premium services is crucial to maintaining our competitive edge in the market.","3224":"Our company has faced some challenges in the past few months due to the pandemic, but we have remained committed to delivering quality products to our customers. [SEP] So we're seeing a lot of people use these products and love them and because of that I think that we're still going to get there. [SEP] We are continuing to work hard to expand our product line and reach even more consumers in the coming months.","3225":"We've seen a significant increase in cyber attacks over the past few months. [SEP] So it takes a lot of engineering investment, and we will be prioritizing that, in some cases by adding people to teams and in other cases by trading off and doing more security work instead of other product work that we might have done, but this is really important and this is our priority. [SEP] But we're confident that with this investment in engineering and security, we'll be able to successfully mitigate these threats and protect our customers' data.","3226":"We've seen strong performance in our hybrid business over the past quarter, driven by increasing demand from our customers for more sustainable energy solutions. [SEP] And so what that means is, you'll see some volatility in that and you're also going to see some volatility in commercial unearned, specifically because whenever you see hybrid strength, it won't land as much in unearned. [SEP] Looking ahead, we expect that these trends will continue, with hybrid solutions playing an increasingly important role in our overall business strategy. While this may lead to some near-term volatility in our financials, we remain confident in our long-term prospects and ability to deliver value for our shareholders.","3227":"In the past quarter, we implemented several updates to our platform, including improving the user interface and adding new features based on customer feedback.

Our team is currently working on several initiatives to enhance the user experience and increase engagement. We are excited to see how these changes will continue to positively impact our users.","3228":"We have received inquiries from our customers regarding the privacy of their data and we take this issue very seriously. [SEP] But the privacy efforts do require significant investments obviously and compliance processes, people and then technical infrastructure and those are factored into the 2019 operating expense outlook. [SEP] However, we believe that investing in privacy measures is not only the right thing to do but also crucial for the long-term success of our business.","3229":"As we move forward in our transition to E5, we'd like to take a moment to reflect on our progress and metrics thus far. [SEP] And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition. [SEP] However, we anticipate that the E5 transition will drive further growth in ARPU as we continue to expand our customer base and offerings.","3230":"We pride ourselves on our emergency response capabilities, which are second to none in the industry. Our commitment to providing timely and effective assistance to those in need has never been stronger. [SEP] And I think in the last six months or a year alone, there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of cases where we're we've been able to get first responders to people when they needed help [SEP] This has led to excellent customer feedback and a solid reputation as a reliable and responsive service provider. We remain focused on further improving our response times and expanding our coverage to ensure that we can meet the needs of all our clients, no matter where they are located.","3231":"I'd like to turn our attention to the impact of our latest product launch.

[SEP] Despite this impact, we remain confident in our ability to meet our financial targets for the year.","3232":"We continue to invest in our social media platforms to ensure they remain relevant and valuable for our users. [SEP] What we see is that people in Instagram are using Instagram to browse for products and make those connections, and so we then make the product investments to make those a little bit easier. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new partnerships and collaborations with businesses to expand our e-commerce capabilities on Instagram and other platforms.","3233":"Our innovation in technology continues to drive the success of our company, as evidenced by our recent developments. [SEP] The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. [SEP] We believe that by utilizing these technologies, we can create a seamless and convenient shopping experience for our customers, while also increasing efficiency and reducing costs for our company.","3234":"Our company has been investing significantly in our technology infrastructure to provide our clients with the most advanced tools to drive their businesses forward.

[SEP] Our platform is designed with scalability in mind, ensuring that it can keep up with the ever-growing demands of our clients' businesses.","3235":"We've been closely monitoring customer behavior and have noticed a trend towards more personalized services. [SEP] So, I think it's part of that offering, and we will really have to see how that evolves. [SEP] But we're excited about the potential for this new offering and believe it can contribute significantly to our revenue streams in the future.","3236":"We have taken measures to streamline our supply chain and supply management processes to better control costs.

[SEP] So those are all things that I would say are premium services that just talking about new applications being built on Azure, not counting all of the SaaS applications about that. [SEP] It seems like Azure has an extensive range of offerings for businesses to take advantage of.","3238":"We've had a lot of success lately with our targeted digital advertising campaigns. [SEP] Now by doing that at the Oscars, that's obviously TV and it's a very broad ad and that's because they were both showing a product but also working on their brand. [SEP] As we continue to explore new avenues for advertising, we'll be looking for opportunities to showcase our products while also building our brand.","3239":"As we wrap up this quarter, I want to highlight some key metrics that will help investors understand our progress. [SEP] I do really focused and I think it's important if you're trying to understand the buildup of our commercial business to focus only on the unearned commercial balance. [SEP] We've seen significant growth in our commercial business over the past year, and we expect this trend to continue as we expand into new markets.","3240":"When asked about the growth potential of their smartphone business in emerging markets, the CEO stated... [SEP] The truth is, there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. [SEP] Our new marketing campaign specifically targets this demographic and we have high hopes for increased sales.","3241":"We've seen very substantial user growth in certain markets that have much lower ARPU than our overall blended ARPU. [SEP] So that tends to also have a mitigating impact on ARPU because of the mix towards those lower-ARPU countries as the users grow there more quickly. [SEP] But overall, the sheer user growth and engagement with our platform gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth going forward.","3242":"We would like to provide an update on our financial performance for the current quarter. Despite facing several headwinds, we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives and achieve our long-term goals. [SEP] In constant currency, when you look at it for the March quarter, revenue would be down between 5% and 10%.

We are confident that our continued focus on innovation and customer satisfaction will drive our success in the coming quarters.","3243":"When it comes to our digital marketing efforts, we're always keeping a close eye on our metrics and making adjustments as needed.

[SEP] Additionally, we've recently implemented some new ad formats and placements to see if we can improve engagement with our target audience.","3244":"One of the challenges we have faced in expanding our global footprint is the variability in payment preferences across different regions. [SEP] Outside the United States, in many markets, not every form of payment is accepted. [SEP] To address this issue, we have been working to establish partnerships with local payment providers in key markets where consumers prefer alternative payment methods.","3245":"Can you give us an overview of your product portfolio and which products are driving your revenue growth? [SEP] So if you think about it from a product portfolio, it really is Windows and Office. [SEP] However, we are seeing some promising traction with our cloud services division, particularly with Azure and Dynamics 365.\"\n\n\"So if you think about it from a product portfolio, it really is Windows and Office. These two products continue to be at the forefront of our revenue generation and remain key drivers of our success in the market. We are continually looking at ways to enhance and improve these products for our customers, while also exploring new opportunities to grow our business in emerging areas.","3246":"One area where we are seeing significant growth is in the political advertising space.

[SEP] So, what is your strategy for addressing this gap in the market?","3254":"Moving on to our Asia Pacific region, we saw some mixed results.

[SEP] However, we are optimistic about the potential for growth in mainland China, where we see increasing demand for our products.","3255":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our services in the past quarter. [SEP] And those carriers are just not - no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak. [SEP] As a result, we are exploring options to expand our own capacity to meet customer demand.","3256":"We've been seeing some significant changes in our industry over the past few quarters, which is why we want to take some time today to discuss the state of our business. Specifically, we've seen some challenges with supply and demand dynamics, which have impacted our financial results. [SEP] One is just the auction dynamic, which as supply growth has slowed, then there's more competition, and you're seeing prices increase as demand continues to grow.

We have also noticed a shift in how people consume media, with social media becoming the go-to source for news and entertainment. [SEP] And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past. [SEP] This level of exposure to diverse content has allowed us to provide more opportunities for advertisers to reach their target audience. Our data shows that users are more likely to engage with ads that are relevant to their interests, which has led to an increase in ad revenue for our platform.

We have been experimenting with different platforms to effectively communicate with our customers.

That being said, we have no plans to shift our main development team out of the U.S. at this time.\" \n\n\"We do recognize the potential benefits of expanding our development efforts elsewhere, but we also want to keep a consistent level of quality and efficiency that we've seen from our U.S.-based team.\" \n\n\"So I think for the foreseeable future, you can expect the majority of our development work to continue to be centered in the U.S.","3288":"I'd like to talk about our company's vision for the future.

[SEP] What you saw a little bit and I referred to it was some more in-quarter recognition, but let me talk about why that\u2019s happening because it's got two important and positive trends that underlie it. [SEP] Firstly, our sales teams have been performing exceptionally well, securing larger deals that are recognized within the quarter as opposed to being spread out over multiple quarters. Secondly, our company has implemented more comprehensive accounting policies and procedures, allowing us to recognize revenue more accurately and efficiently. Overall, we anticipate these trends will continue to drive growth in the future.","3292":"Now moving on to our market performance, let's take a look at the latest trends in first-time buyer rates.

[SEP] As we continue to invest in these delivery options, we're also seeing increased demand from customers for faster delivery times. We're constantly evaluating how we can provide the best delivery experience while also maintaining profitability.","3355":"Our team is extremely happy to report record earnings this quarter, which surpassed analyst expectations. We are seeing tremendous growth across our portfolio of products, but one area in particular that we're excited about is the growth in the install base of iPhones. [SEP] Starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones, yes, it's growing strong double digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business. [SEP] This growth in iPhone users is allowing us to offer more Services to customers, such as Apple Music and Apple Pay. Additionally, it's providing us with a larger audience to showcase our new products and services for. We're thrilled with the momentum we're seeing from iPhone sales and anticipate this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","3356":"During the quarter, we focused on our social media advertising strategy and how it's driving engagement. [SEP] Mark talked about how we have 4 billion video views on Facebook everyday and we've always believed that the format of our ads should follow the format of what consumers are doing on Facebook. [SEP] And we're seeing great results, with a 25% increase in click-through rates on our Facebook ads compared to last year.","3357":"We've received a few questions regarding our recent pricing strategy, so I'd like to address that first. [SEP] Yes, Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and well received and do show a level of elasticity, but the most important thing by far is the product. [SEP] Our product team has been working hard to gather feedback from our customers and make improvements where necessary, and I'm confident that our focus on delivering a quality product will continue to drive our success.","3358":"Our partnerships with HyperScale have been instrumental in driving our growth over the past several years. [SEP] We are not just building or moving their IT but they are building new digital services for HyperScale and that's what it is probably unique in terms of what is changed year-over-year for us. [SEP] We are confident that these new digital services will allow us to continue to meet and exceed our customers' expectations.","3359":"As we look back at the past quarter, we can see that our company has continued to perform well despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. Our revenue and earnings have remained steady, and we are confident in our ability to continue delivering value to our shareholders. [SEP] And so with that in mind, we have done $23.5 billion of repurchases during the March quarter. [SEP] We believe that our ongoing focus on share repurchases is a key driver of long-term shareholder value. By reducing our outstanding share count, we increase the earnings per share that we can deliver to our investors. Looking ahead, we anticipate continuing this strategy in the coming quarters, as we remain committed to creating value for our shareholders.","3360":"Our projections for next quarter are in line with our previous guidance. [SEP] So if you wrap those together, we expect it\u2019s going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate. [SEP] However, we have plans in place to address these challenges and remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term growth.","3361":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve the user experience on our platform. [SEP] The best example of that is probably news with Instant Articles where we figured out that, it was the slowest upload experience you could have in newsfeed to link off to an outside article. [SEP] Once we recognized this issue, we worked quickly to develop Instant Articles, which allows for a much faster and seamless reading experience within Facebook.","3362":"Our sales team worked tirelessly to expand distribution channels and reach new customers. [SEP] We increased the iPhone point of sales to over 40,000 during the quarter. [SEP] This was a significant achievement and contributed to the overall growth of our business in the quarter.","3363":"We recently conducted a study on the rate of coding errors in our software development department. [SEP] And what we found is that the main reason code was sent back at different rates was not correlated with gender. [SEP] Instead, the differences were primarily due to variations in experience and training levels among our developers.","3364":"Another question from our analysts is from Mark regarding the expiry base for Q1. [SEP] And I apologize, I didn't answer Marks last component, so let me just go back and I had forgotten, which was, was there anything unique in the expiry base for Q1, the answer is, it is up a little year-over-year, but in certainly not through the same type of Q4 comparable. [SEP] Overall, our team is pleased with the performance of Q1 and we are optimistic about the rest of the year.","3365":"We're really excited about the growth we're seeing on Instagram. [SEP] And with 1 billion active people on the platform, I think Instagram is definitely both a direct response opportunity but an opportunity for discovery. [SEP] We'll continue to invest in the platform and find new ways for businesses to connect with our community.","3366":"Our team has been analyzing the current market trends for the past quarter and we have some interesting insights to share. [SEP] And the thing that we have realized is, that businesses are in fact looking to spend more for those first line worker productivity. [SEP] As a result of this realization, we have decided to dedicate more resources towards developing innovative solutions for first line worker productivity.","3367":"We've had strong headwinds in the industry recently, but we're glad to report that we held steady this quarter. [SEP] And so in this particular quarter, we were able to end basically right at the bottom end of our range and we view that as a good thing, not a bad thing. [SEP] Overall, we're confident about the direction we're heading in and we expect even stronger results in the coming quarters.","3368":"We have seen strong demand for our latest product offerings and are pleased with the positive reception from consumers. Our team has worked tirelessly to bring these new models to market and we are confident that they will continue to drive growth for our business.

We are committed to innovation and are constantly exploring new ways to enhance our products and services. We believe that by staying at the forefront of technology, we can continue to deliver value for our shareholders while meeting the evolving needs of our customers.","3369":"In response to a question about the Apple Watch's performance in the market. [SEP] Apple Watch is not only a new product, but it\u2019s a brand new category with a lot of new features, a lot of new, innovative technologies. [SEP] We are excited by the positive initial response to the Apple Watch and are constantly working to improve the user experience with software updates and new features.","3370":"We've been investing in our data and analytics capabilities, giving us a more granular understanding of our customers' preferences, behaviors, and demographics. [SEP] Just age and gender, we're 38% more accurate than broad-based targeting according to Nielsen in the U.S., and that's just age and gender. [SEP] This increased accuracy is just the beginning. As we continue to invest in our data and analytics capabilities, we expect to see even stronger results in our targeted advertising campaigns.","3371":"As we look to the future, we are evaluating our profit margins and how to improve them. [SEP] A more blended rate of those two is probably a better way to think about a go-forward margin. [SEP] We believe that by focusing on operational efficiencies and cost controls, we can achieve this blended rate and improve our overall profitability.","3372":"Can you talk a little bit about your capital expenditure plans for the next quarter? [SEP] Our guidance, really, in terms of overall capital spend is unchanged from 90 days ago even if the timing of that can move month-to-month. [SEP] And are there any specific areas where you plan to allocate more capital spend in the upcoming quarters?","3373":"Can you provide some guidance on the expected revenue for Q4? [SEP] So if you, even factoring that, and we're looking at Q4 and we have very high error bars on the quarter. [SEP] But overall, we are cautiously optimistic about our growth potential in the coming months.","3374":"Our ad targeting technology has continued to improve and our advertisers have been taking advantage of it to create more effective ad campaigns. We've been seeing some interesting trends and results in terms of engagement. [SEP] When ads are really well targeted and taking full advantage of the kind of targeting we offer, so you're showing people something they want to see, we see engagement that we think is really critical. [SEP] In fact, we've seen some campaigns that have doubled or tripled their engagement rates by implementing better targeting strategies. This is encouraging for us because it shows that our platform is helping our advertisers to be more successful. We will continue to invest in improving our targeting capabilities to drive even better results.","3375":"During the past quarter, we experienced significant growth in our cloud computing and internet of things (IoT) segments. Our Azure platform remains a strong driver of this growth, as more and more businesses turn to us for their cloud computing needs. [SEP] Because we realized that, for example, you take any IoT project that is starting in Azure, it first translates into an analytics workload that pulls through some Azure high router analytics services. [SEP] From there, it can move on to other Azure services, such as our machine learning and artificial intelligence tools. The combination of these services results in a powerful, integrated solution for IoT projects \u2013 one that is unique in the industry. We believe this approach will continue to drive growth in our cloud computing business for years to come.","3376":"In terms of our content strategy, we're always looking for ways to innovate and improve our offerings. [SEP] On that front, we're focused on building out the best video experiences for our community and growing longer-form content as a priority. [SEP] We've also invested heavily in our video production capabilities to ensure that we can create high-quality content that resonates with our audience.","3377":"A question was asked about Facebook's strategy for the future. [SEP] So I think in the future if this works out, what we're going to see is that how people use the Facebook app is going to be, they're going to keep on using News Feed, they are going to keep on sharing with friends and family, but the average person will also probably have one, two or three other apps or kind of secondary tabs that they use that are quite useful for them in connecting with their broader community on Facebook. [SEP] We're really excited about these other apps because some of them are more focused on specific interests or groups,\" said the CEO. \"For example, one of the new apps we're testing is all about connecting people who love hiking. It's still in the early stages, but we think it has a lot of potential.","3378":"Our company has been undergoing some changes lately. We are looking to increase our profits and grow our customer base. Today, we want to update you on our progress and our plans for the future. [SEP] We've thought about making this transition as quickly as possible, but what we're seeing, which you heard us talk about, was a transition to increasing premium mix, selling more workloads, doing all of that while we're growing the installed base. [SEP] We believe that this transition is necessary to achieve our long-term goals. We want to provide our customers with the best possible products and services, while also increasing our revenue and profitability. That's why we're taking a careful and measured approach to this transition, to ensure that we can achieve all of our objectives without compromising on quality or customer satisfaction.","3379":"Could you elaborate on the impact of seasonality on Q1 results? [SEP] We didn't see as much of it in Q1, mainly because of the timing of the seasonality of the year and getting things going. [SEP] However, we anticipate seeing a significant increase in that area in Q2 as we ramp up our marketing efforts and capitalize on the busy summer season.","3380":"We've seen some great success in our marketing campaigns and customer outreach initiatives over the past quarter.

As you can see from the numbers we've just released, we've had another strong quarter with revenue growth in line with our expectations. [SEP] Looking in the old segments, I know you all have done, we saw a year-over-year improvement in the overall commercial other segment that we disclosed this time too of about 10 points year over year. [SEP] This was driven by a combination of factors, including a better product mix and increased demand from certain key customers. While we are pleased with this progress, we recognize there is still work to be done to fully capitalize on the opportunity in this area. We remain committed to investing in and growing this segment of our business in the quarters ahead.","3383":"Now, let's turn our attention to our financials for the quarter.\" \n2. \"Investors have been asking about our capital expenditures and how they're impacting our finances. [SEP] We're seeing that large CapEx build over the last several years flowing through depreciation and cost of revenue. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue for the next few years, but we're confident that our revenue growth will outpace these costs.\" \n2. \"As a result, we're exploring ways to diversify our revenue streams and reduce our reliance on our traditional product offerings.","3384":"Our focus this quarter has been on growth in our healthcare division. [SEP] We'll have significant gross margin dollar growth in that segment, and you'll actually continue to see operating margin dollar growth that's significant in that segment even as we reinvest into it, given the top line signal. [SEP] We believe this investment will pay off in the long-term and continue to drive strong financial performance for our company.","3385":"We are pleased to report another strong quarter for Facebook. Our revenue grew by 28% year over year to $21.5 billion, and we continue to see strong user engagement across our family of apps.

Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in our advertising business and expect to see sustained momentum in hiring as we invest in our future growth opportunities.","3386":"We are excited to continue exploring the video space and investing in our video capabilities. [SEP] But as has been noted on the call, video is both at large scale and the economics are quite different from the current feed-based businesses that we have today, especially around how, with mid-roll ads and rev share around that, the margin structure will be different. [SEP] However, we believe that there is significant opportunity for growth and profitability in this area and are confident in our ability to navigate these differences.","3387":"We've seen tremendous growth in our user base over the past year. As a result, we need to make sure our infrastructure is capable of handling this increased demand. [SEP] So, we're going to be investing to deliver the best quality services that we can for our users, so we'll continue to invest heavily on the datacenter and infrastructure side going forward.

Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made and excited about the potential for future growth in our advertising efforts.","3397":"Our earnings this quarter have been impressive, driven in part by the growth of our VoIP business. [SEP] And one thing that you may not know about voice calling is that by using the Internet for calling rather than the relatively low bit rate voice networks, you can actually get higher quality calls using VoIP. [SEP] As more consumers become aware of the benefits of VoIP, we expect this segment to continue to grow and contribute to our overall success. Additionally, the cost savings associated with VoIP have allowed us to reinvest in other areas of the business and stay ahead of the competition.","3398":"Our company has seen steady growth in the past year, and we are excited to share some updates on our progress during this earnings call. [SEP] As I said earlier, we had a meaningful step up in shipments in Q2 versus Q1, but we're still on our way and Q3 will be a step up over Q2 in North America and we'll see more in international.

[SEP] And I'm still of the mindset that I feel very optimistic and positive that the discussions that are going will be fruitful. [SEP] It may take some time to finalize any agreements, but I believe we are headed in the right direction.","3401":"We've made a conscious effort to expand our offering in a strategic way. We've added new features and functionalities that we believe will further enhance the experience for our users. [SEP] So they are in general -- the way we think about this stuff is, we try not to put something in front of a lot of people unless we're confident that they're going to find it useful and want to come back and use it multiple times and we can put a lot of things in front of people not to try it once, but we want to wait until things are kind of retentive and useful.

As we continue to grow and evolve, we'll keep our users top of mind and ensure that we're providing them with the best possible experience.","3402":"We're seeing strong adoption of Office 365 across all our segments and geographies. [SEP] In fact, one of the things in Office 365 is we're getting people to effectively use servers, which now happens to be in cloud who never bought servers from us ever before because they didn\u2019t have exchange, they didn\u2019t have link, they didn\u2019t have any of the core capabilities of Office 365.

We have continued to invest heavily in this program, both to expand its benefits and to improve the underlying economics of our operation.

[SEP] Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we launched Global Video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping.

Do you provide ongoing training?","3482":"We've seen a significant rise in engagement with content that is both informative and entertaining. In particular, the recent success of our \"Watch Together\" feature has demonstrated the appeal of shared viewing experiences.

[SEP] We have also been working on improving our ad targeting algorithms to ensure they are based on relevant interests and behavior rather than personal information.","3487":"We've recently expanded our seller base globally, and I know there has been some interest in how that is going. [SEP] So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in \u2013 who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country.

[SEP] As a result, we have been working on adapting our technology to meet these changing needs and provide the best user experience possible.","3490":"In terms of our financial performance this quarter, we did see some significant changes. Overall revenue continued to increase, but we also saw a rise in our cost of revenue. Let me dive into that a bit more. [SEP] A couple of things that I\u2019d point to the cost of revenue was up 49% in Q2, and that\u2019s really the flow-through of depreciation that you\u2019re seeing from the big CapEx build cycle that we\u2019ve been in and that\u2019s starting to flow through in the cost profile of the business. [SEP] However, we are confident that this investment in our infrastructure will pay off in the long run as we expand our product offerings and grow our customer base. We are also taking steps to optimize our cost structure and improve operational efficiencies to help mitigate the impact of these expenses. Overall, we remain focused on delivering value to our investors while continuing to execute on our growth strategy.","3491":"We are excited to continue driving innovation across our suite of products and services.

[SEP] This has allowed us to build stronger relationships with our clients and continue to push the boundaries of what we can offer them.","3493":"One question that has been on investors' minds is how much advertising can be inserted into the company's products and services without alienating users.

[SEP] However, our goal is always to strike the right balance between providing value to our advertisers and maintaining a positive user experience.","3494":"When we launched our new platform for international sellers last year, we aimed to expand our global reach and attract more sellers from different parts of the world.

[SEP] Moreover, we continue to enhance our platform by adding more features and improving the user experience for our sellers.

[SEP] We will continue to invest in developer momentum and ensure that our products are meeting the needs of our customers and partners in order to maintain our strong position in the market.","3496":"Our revenue growth has been primarily driven by the success of our software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. [SEP] But the interesting thing is it's not just even for our own SaaS applications. [SEP] We're also seeing increasing demand from other companies who are interested in our cloud-based solutions.","3497":"Our company has made significant investments in our supply chain and logistics capabilities. Now I'd like to highlight some notable developments in our delivery options.

[SEP] So, as you know our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time and increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. [SEP] This growth in third-party selection is driving positive trends across our business, and we expect it to continue to be a key driver of our growth in the future.","3502":"As we analyze our performance this quarter, there are a few notable trends to mention. [SEP] The other thing that's happened is that the decline that we've been experiencing in Hong Kong moderated. [SEP] We attribute this moderation to a combination of factors, including temporary stabilization in political unrest and our strategic efforts to appeal to local customers. However, we remain cautious about the unpredictable nature of this market and will continue to monitor it closely.","3503":"Now let's turn our attention to our performance in Q2. [SEP] Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. [SEP] We believe that our continued investment in video, music, and shipping benefits will result in stronger customer loyalty and increased engagement in the future.","3504":"One thing that's really been helping us recently is our ability to be more flexible with adding capacity to meet changing demand. [SEP] I think we're also getting much better at adding capacity faster, so there's less need to build it 6 to 12 months in advance, I would say. [SEP] Of course, there are always going to be unforeseen circumstances, but overall I'm very optimistic about our ability to respond to market shifts quickly and efficiently.","3505":"During the quarter we saw a significant increase in revenue from our advertising business. [SEP] So for example, using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those. [SEP] This continued growth is largely due to the advanced targeting capabilities we offer, allowing advertisers to reach their desired audience with precision and efficiency.","3506":"Our product development team has been working tirelessly to bring new and innovative services to our loyal customers.\n- We know that our customers want more from us, and so we're always looking for ways to provide even greater value.

[SEP] And so to some degree that exists today, my perspective is that we will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately. [SEP] This growth will require us to continue investing in our operations and staff to ensure that we are able to scale efficiently while maintaining our high standards for quality and customer service.","3508":"Our company has been working hard to improve the overall customer experience across all of our platforms. We believe that our investments in technology and infrastructure have been paying off. [SEP] The difference between core compute in-store versus the premium layers can be significant and we\u2019ve had improvements across all of them. [SEP] As we continue to monitor customer behavior and preferences, we will adjust our strategy accordingly. We remain committed to delivering the best possible experience to our customers, wherever they choose to interact with our brand.","3509":"We've seen tremendous growth in our Indian market over the past year.

[SEP] There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world. [SEP] So, how do you expect FX to impact the company's performance going forward?\" \n\"We don't anticipate as significant of a tailwind in future quarters, as exchange rates have been fairly stable recently,\" replied the speaker. \"However, we continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our strategies accordingly.","3512":"Can you speak to how you plan to improve ad revenue moving forward? [SEP] In terms of what the opportunity there is to drive it, it's really about increasing the relevance and quality of the ads.

[SEP] Yeah, John, on the video investment in the first quarter, it's clearly going to be more weighted towards the rest of the year, but we're already seeing the impact of some of that. [SEP] As we continue to invest in video capabilities and content, we expect to see even greater benefits in the future.","3514":"We believe in an open and collaborative workplace culture. [SEP] Again, we're not going to tell you that you can't share other stuff, right. [SEP] But when it comes to confidential company information, we ask that you respect our policies and not disclose it to anyone outside the company.","3515":"We have some exciting news to share regarding changes in the way we report our sales figures. [SEP] Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. [SEP] This change is part of our ongoing effort to provide more transparency in our financial reporting and better reflect the true revenue we are generating from our various business segments.","3516":"Now turning to our business outlook for the remainder of the year. [SEP] We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than or \u2013 roughly or greater than 30% square footage growth in operations. [SEP] I'm pleased to announce that we are on track to meet or even exceed that projection due to the strong demand and opportunities in our market.","3517":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] So we've taken some provisional estimates in coming up with our tax entries for the quarter, and we will have to do that as we go forward here during the year. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to accurately adjust our tax entries as we receive more information throughout the year.","3518":"Now I'd like to turn to our IP segment and discuss some notable trends we've observed in recent quarters. [SEP] The second component relates to the same trend we saw in our IP business that we saw in Q4 then in Q1, we\u2019re doing and seeing again in Q2. [SEP] Specifically, we're seeing increased demand for our digital rights management solutions, which is driving growth in this area.","3519":"Our cloud products have shown strong growth over the past quarter and we are continuing to develop new features and offerings. [SEP] So I think all of, both of our cloud products, the major cloud products have these premium tiers that the mix shift to those or the addition of those is something that we're focused on and we see in our results [SEP] Additionally, we have seen a significant increase in demand for these premium tiers as customers look for more advanced functionality. We will continue to invest in our cloud offerings to meet this demand and maintain our position as a leader in the industry.","3520":"Our new subscription model has allowed us to achieve that dream finally. [SEP] In all the years I\u2019ve been at Microsoft it was always our dream to be able to sell more of the sophisticated capabilities of Office to individual consumers as well as small businesses. [SEP] This has resulted in a significant increase in revenue for our Office division.","3521":"Our team has analyzed the recent data and we're seeing positive trends. [SEP] On marketplace, we're just going to continue to iterate on the ad test. [SEP] We've also had some success with personalizing the ad experience based on user behavior.","3522":"We've seen a lot of growth in our advertising business this quarter.

[SEP] This is just one example of how our program is helping to support job creation and economic growth in communities across the country.","3524":"When we talk about our performance in China, there's always a bit of skepticism or concern among some stakeholders. [SEP] I see China as may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it. [SEP] And despite the challenges, I remain optimistic about our growth potential in China over the next few years.","3525":"We have been closely monitoring market trends and consumer behavior to identify new opportunities for growth. [SEP] So a small group product for sharing video, that's going to be a thing. [SEP] Our team has been working diligently to develop and test this product, and we are confident that it will be a valuable addition to our portfolio.","3526":"Now let's turn our attention to the first quarter. [SEP] One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1 we talked about in April 1st there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. [SEP] This resulted in a significant distortion in the revenue numbers during that time period.","3527":"In terms of our e-commerce platform, we continue to focus on providing the best experience for our customers and sellers. [SEP] We are really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first-party or third-party and I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. [SEP] One of our key priorities is to enhance our seller tools and resources to help them grow their businesses on our platform.","3528":"We are thrilled to report that our company has had another quarter of strong growth.

As you know, we just released our Q3 financial results, and I'm here to give you a deeper dive into the numbers.

Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to navigate the current market conditions and continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Thank you again for your time today.","3531":"We've been seeing an increasing demand for longer form content from our audience. [SEP] And to your question about long form content, the more natural starting point for us is shorter form content which can either be social content or premium short form content. [SEP] However, we do see potential in producing longer form content in the future and we are actively exploring different formats and platforms to deliver it.","3532":"We are very excited about the growth potential of our company in the coming year. [SEP] because ultimately this is all driven by the opportunity at hand, which is much bigger than anything that we have participated in the past, so the total addressable market is much bigger. [SEP] Our team is dedicated to maximizing this opportunity and capitalizing on the potential of this larger market.","3533":"In terms of our core infrastructure, we\u2019re really pleased with our progress in scaling Azure. [SEP] Once you get beyond Azure, you have things like CRM Online, you have enterprise mobility suite and of course the Office 365 line up and when we think about our capital and in fact the core infrastructure, we don\u2019t have different infrastructure for these different services. [SEP] We are able to reuse the same infrastructure across all of those services and that's one of the things that enables us to get better economics than many of our competitors.","3534":"During the last quarter, we saw strong demand for our latest iPhone release. [SEP] But I would also point out that we had the highest number of customers new to iPhone last quarter than in any prior launch. [SEP] Additionally, our customer satisfaction surveys indicate that the new iPhone has been very well received, which bodes well for future sales.","3535":"We received regulatory approval for the acquisition of PillPack a few months ago. We are excited about this acquisition and what it means for our future growth in the healthcare industry. [SEP] On PillPack, yes, the deal of course hasn't closed, yet. [SEP] However, we are confident that the transaction will close as planned and we are already working on integration plans. We believe that PillPack's technology and expertise will complement our existing capabilities and help us to better serve our customers.","3536":"We've analyzed our market data and customer trends extensively. [SEP] But we see the pattern emerge pretty clearly in terms of where we need to go. [SEP] Our team is already working on implementing strategies to meet these goals.","3537":"Our e-commerce platform has seen a significant increase in traffic over the past quarter. [SEP] And so we have the delivery people going out and making the deliveries in the neighborhoods. [SEP] We have also implemented additional safety measures for our delivery staff, including providing them with personal protective equipment and conducting daily health screenings.","3538":"We had a strong quarter with revenue exceeding projections and increasing year-over-year. Our growth has been driven by several key initiatives that are delivering results. [SEP] And then I'd point to significant investment areas like AR\/VR efforts, the content ecosystem around video, and the ongoing investment in safety and security. [SEP] We believe these investments will support our long-term growth and position us as leaders in these areas. We are committed to delivering the best products and experiences to our customers, and these investments will help us achieve that.","3539":"We've invested a lot of resources into improving our data labeling processes. Our team has been working diligently to ensure that our models are being fed valid and accurate information.

[SEP] This increased accuracy is important for our clients who rely on our models to make important business decisions. Our goal is to continue refining these processes to deliver the best results for our clients and their businesses.","3540":"Our revenue growth has slowed down compared to the previous quarter. We've been conducting a thorough analysis to identify the cause of this slowdown. [SEP] We didn't see it in any one particular workload; it's weakness across workloads, which tends to make more sense frankly with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint. [SEP] Our sales team has been working hard to diversify our client base to mitigate the impact of this weakness. However, we anticipate that this trend may continue for the next couple of quarters. We remain committed to our long-term growth strategy, and we are confident in our ability to navigate these short-term challenges.","3541":"In terms of our cloud business, I wanted to take a moment to highlight our recent success with multi-cloud adoption. [SEP] And so we, of course, see multi-cloud in a lot of our larger accounts, but this type of significant commitments is an opportunity, I think, you will continue to see us execute well on. [SEP] As we continue to invest in our cloud offerings and work closely with our customers to understand their needs, we believe that multi-cloud will only become more prevalent and continue to drive growth for our business.","3542":"Another important aspect of our business this quarter was our expansion into international markets. [SEP] We talked about the growth of our EMS, which is a higher level service. [SEP] We have received very positive feedback from our customers regarding the increased capabilities and benefits of our EMS.","3543":"We've been closely monitoring consumer behavior and preferences in our industry. [SEP] So we're playing with a lot of different models to see what resonates with consumers and it'll guide our investment decisions going forward [SEP] Our goal is to maximize ROI while also providing a satisfying experience for our customers.","3544":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our operating expenses for the first quarter. [SEP] On the OpEx guide, Q1 came in slightly below our annual expense growth guidance, but we do expect that investments in areas like video and Oculus will impact the remainder of the year more substantially [SEP] However, we believe these strategic investments are critical to our long-term growth and will position us for success in the future.","3545":"Another question from the analysts was whether the company foresees any major changes in their traditional business. [SEP] And so I think all of those, when you talk about should we expect the traditional business to be in decline, I don't think that's new. [SEP] However, we have identified new growth opportunities in the market and are actively pursuing them to expand our business.","3546":"We're really excited about the growth potential in this segment. [SEP] It's coming in operations, and we have some very competitive price points there. [SEP] We're confident that we can continue to gain market share in this space.","3547":"Our company has been performing exceptionally well in the current market conditions. [SEP] I don't know long-term whether there is a zero-sum equation, but right now and in the intermediate timeframe, we see in our case growth in both sides. [SEP] Our team is constantly exploring new opportunities for growth and expanding our product offerings.","3548":"Our team has been working tirelessly to innovate and create new opportunities for growth. As part of our strategy, we've been focusing on building cutting-edge technology that will take us to the next level.

This is just the beginning of our innovation journey, and we are committed to driving continued growth and success for our company and our customers.","3549":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in revenue from our Prime membership program. [SEP] On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. [SEP] We're looking to expand our restaurant delivery offerings to even more cities in the coming months.","3550":"We've been lowering prices on a regular basis for over 10 years in AWS. [SEP] But again, price cuts and not only price cuts but new products that have lower average cost and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. [SEP] So, I expect that to continue and I believe that over time that just becomes a reality for us as we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and bring those costs down.","3551":"As we look to continue our growth trajectory, we realize that our biggest challenge will be attracting and retaining top talent. [SEP] We've already invested in accelerating our recruiting efforts, so I wanted to highlight that. [SEP] In the coming months, we'll be doubling down on our employee referral program and exploring new partnerships with universities to ensure we're reaching the best and brightest candidates.","3552":"We've been focusing a lot on expanding our workforce in the past year. [SEP] So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories actually exceeded the company growth rate. [SEP] We're really pleased with the progress we're making in those areas and we'll continue to invest in them in the coming year.","3553":"Moving on to our advertising business, I'm happy to report strong results for this quarter. [SEP] On the demand side, we see a good traction across both platforms, and we're rolling out more ability for advertisers to leverage ads in Stories with more formats and the like. [SEP] Additionally, we've continued to make improvements to our targeting capabilities to ensure that advertisers are reaching the right audience for their campaigns.","3554":"We've been really working hard to grow our hardware business, focusing on our Surface product line in particular. [SEP] I feel good about the hardware, especially the Surface performance as we launch into more geos. [SEP] Our sales team has been doing a great job getting our new products into stores across the globe, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this impacts our revenue going forward.","3555":"Our focus on streamlining operations and maximizing efficiency has had a positive impact on our bottom line. [SEP] And we were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale. [SEP] Looking ahead, we plan to continue expanding our reach while maintaining our commitment to providing quality products and exceptional customer service.","3556":"We have seen solid growth across all our services this past year, and we are optimistic about the future. [SEP] You're right, the fundamental driver is when I look forward into next year, I expect each service just like it did this year to really see gross margin improvement, whether that service is LinkedIn or Dynamics or Office 365, Azure per user or Azure IaaS in PaaS, but what you'll see is a revenue mix shift, right, that will offset that to Azure IaaS and PaaS. [SEP] However, we are continuously exploring new growth opportunities and adjusting our strategies to ensure the long-term success of the company.","3557":"Can you talk more about your plans for augmented reality?\"\n\n\"Well, we see AR as a huge opportunity for our company. It's not just about filters and fun effects - it's about creating a whole new way to experience the world around us. And to do that, we realized we needed to take a different approach,\" the speaker replied. [SEP] So we built \u2013 we're making the cameras inside the whole family of apps into the first augmented reality platform, into an open platform, which is different from what any other app that has a camera has done before. [SEP] That sounds really exciting. So how are you planning to make this AR platform available to developers?\"\n\n\"We're currently in the process of rolling it out, actually. We've already opened it up to a select group of developers, and so far the response has been really positive. Our hope is that this platform will enable a whole ecosystem of AR experiences that can be accessed seamlessly across different apps and devices. It's still early days, but we're really bullish on the potential here.","3558":"Our Q4 earnings have exceeded our expectations,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] because of all the new products that we announced on iPad with the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 in the October timeframe during the quarter. [SEP] We believe that our continued innovation and customer focus will drive even stronger results in the coming year,\" the CEO added.","3559":"We've seen incredible growth in our Office 365 software suite over the past year,\" said the company's CEO. [SEP] And I'm actually going to expand my comments a little bit because the sales motion is really broader than Office 365. [SEP] Our sales team is also focused on promoting our line of AI-powered solutions and our enterprise security products,\" added the CFO.","3560":"We have seen strong growth in our recurring revenue streams over the past quarter.

Additionally, we are exploring other digital marketing opportunities to further engage our customers and drive sales.","3562":"Our focus as a company has always been on providing the best possible service to our customers. We believe that by consistently delivering high-quality products and services, we can build long-term relationships with customers and create sustainable growth for our business.

It's clear that we need to reassess how we approach technology design. [SEP] But now I think we're living in a world where \u2013 the way that I think about this is that people should really be at the center of how we design technology. [SEP] We need to think about the impact that our technology has on people's lives and prioritize their well-being. This means taking a more human-centered approach and thinking about the ways in which we can use technology to make people's lives better. It's a big challenge, but it's one that we're excited to take on.","3565":"We're really excited about our new product that we're launching next quarter. It's unlike anything else in the market and we believe it's going to be a game-changer. [SEP] But it's using some of the same technologies you would see in self-driving cars; computer vision, sensor, fusion, deep learning. [SEP] Our engineers have been working tirelessly to ensure that the technology behind this product is top-notch. We're leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning to make this product the best it can be.","3566":"We've had a lot of questions from investors lately about how we manage our inventory. [SEP] The other part of it is that we always run with just the amount of inventory that we think we need. [SEP] Of course, there are times when we have to adjust that - if we see a major trend in sales, for example, or if there are supply-chain disruptions.","3567":"I want to highlight some of the successes we've had over the past quarter. [SEP] In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had -- over in the press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses. [SEP] This is a testament to the value these businesses bring to our platform and the importance of supporting them in the current economic climate.","3568":"Can you discuss the current state of video content on our platform? [SEP] So, we certainly have video in feed and people can put video into stories and different places. [SEP] But what about longer-form video content? Are there any plans to incorporate that into our platform?","3569":"Our Q3 earnings report shows that we have exceeded revenue expectations.

[SEP] Our technology is strong and we're confident in our ability to continue to innovate and stay ahead of the curve in this space.","3573":"Moving on to our user acquisition strategy. [SEP] Secondly, I would say we were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. [SEP] This just goes to show the appeal of our products and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.","3574":"Another area where we saw strong growth in the past quarter was in our cloud services division. [SEP] But to your previous question, even there, there are multiple trends here, and Amy referenced it in her remarks, which is for example, virtualization still continues to be a growth driver of server products.

As you know, GDPR went into effect on May 25th, right near the end of our Q2. [SEP] So GDPR didn't have a significant impact in Q2, partially because of its implementation date. [SEP] However, we anticipate that GDPR will have a significant impact on our Q3 results. We've seen a noticeable decrease in our European user base since the implementation of GDPR, and we're still working out how to best approach compliance measures.

Our community guidelines are constantly evolving and we are committed to enforcing them. However, we realize that relying solely on human moderators is not scalable nor entirely effective. [SEP] And we can do better with people, but ultimately the best thing that we can do is build AI systems that can watch a video and understand that it's going to be problematic and violate the policies of our community and that people aren't going to want to see it and then just not show it to people before bad experiences happen and things like violence gets spread through \u2013 violent content gets spread through the network. [SEP] Our investments in AI technology have already yielded positive results. The system has been able to identify and remove harmful content at a faster rate than human moderators.

We believe this approach is necessary to maintain the integrity of our platform and protect our users.","3584":"We are pleased to announce our quarterly earnings for Q3.

[SEP] Our team is excited to continue exploring this space and identify new opportunities for growth in the video content market.","3595":"We are very excited about the growth we are seeing in our Stories feature.

We launched several new products and services that were well-received by our customers. [SEP] In Q3, we expected that to grow, we put into our guidance and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance. [SEP] Moving forward, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects for the fourth quarter and beyond. We're confident that our continued investments in research and development will enable us to maintain our competitive edge and deliver even more value to our shareholders.","3650":"Now let's turn our attention to our international segment. [SEP] So certainly, a lot going on in international, a lot that's really good, adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. [SEP] And we're seeing strong customer engagement metrics across the board.","3651":"Our marketing team has done extensive research on current market trends and demand for wearable technology. [SEP] because we're convinced that the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season. [SEP] We have increased our production capacity to meet the anticipated high demand for the Apple Watch during the holiday season.","3652":"One thing we noticed is that when we deploy security measures, it often leads to some unintended consequences. [SEP] When you see that deployment for security reasons, an externality of that is people often choose to upgrade machines in that process. [SEP] This has resulted in an increase in hardware sales for us, as our clients want to make sure their systems are fully up-to-date and secure.","3653":"Our Q2 earnings have been strong, with revenue growth coming in at 7%. We're pleased to see this growth, especially given the challenging economic times. [SEP] And the other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products. [SEP] As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we anticipate this mix of products will continue to shift. While some of our traditional offerings may see a slight decline in demand, we're confident that our newer products will pick up the slack and keep our overall revenue growth on track. We'll be keeping a close eye on this trend as we move forward.","3654":"Looking at our revenue breakdown by segment, we have seen growth in all areas except for one. [SEP] But that 20%, right, lends itself in-quarter to the volatility you see. [SEP] We are closely monitoring this segment and working to address any issues that may be contributing to its lack of growth.","3655":"We have seen tremendous growth in social media sales over the past quarter. [SEP] And during the period of her campaign, Instagram accounted for 79% of her sales. [SEP] This success has given us the confidence to increase our marketing budget for social media platforms.","3656":"We're really pleased with the progress we've seen with our advertising business. It continues to be a very valuable and profitable area for us, and we're excited about the future growth potential. [SEP] And again, Amazon advertising and Sizmek has many mutual customers, so we know how valued these prudent solutions are to the customer base. [SEP] Moving forward, we plan to build on this success by continuing to invest in innovative advertising solutions that help our customers reach their audiences more effectively. And of course, we'll be looking for new ways to leverage the synergies between Amazon advertising and Sizmek to bring even more value to our mutual customers.","3657":"We are seeing a lot of growth in our cloud business, and it's very exciting. Our customers are really embracing cloud solutions and we are seeing a lot of demand for our services. [SEP] So I am actually as excited about new cloud growth from new cloud workloads from the same customers so the much interesting thing that I am observing is that it could be the same model customer that was participating with us in the client server area. [SEP] But what's even more interesting is that we are seeing growth in new cloud workloads from existing customers. It just goes to show that once our customers make the transition to cloud, they see the benefits and continue to expand their use of our services. This is a key driver of our growth strategy going forward.","3658":"We're seeing a lot of opportunity for growth in our advertising business. While we've made progress in the past year, we know there are still areas where we can improve. [SEP] It's really about us getting better at targeting and working with especially people where we get those downstream signals like direct response advertisers. [SEP] To that end, we're investing in new technologies and hiring additional experts to help us better understand our audience. We believe that by taking these steps, we can create more effective campaigns and deliver more value to our clients.","3659":"During the past quarter, we have seen impressive growth in our international market, particularly in China. [SEP] So the team had some interesting ideas, really focused on making Amazon a trusted conduit for Chinese customers to access, authentic international branded products, and things that customers can't get. [SEP] We believe that this strategy will position us well for continued growth and success in the Chinese market.","3660":"Our research and development team has been working tirelessly to improve our existing products and services, but we are also focused on the future and what new technologies will be available to us in the coming years. [SEP] But there are also going to be all these new kinds of things that we're not even building today that developers will be able to experiment with. [SEP] We believe that by giving developers the tools and resources they need to innovate, we can not only stay ahead of the competition but also create entirely new markets and revenue streams. So stay tuned for some exciting developments in the near future!","3661":"We've seen a lot of interest from our customer base in our cloud offerings and advanced analytics capabilities. [SEP] So it's really the combination of SQL advanced analytics and the cloud with things like Azure datalink that are really the choices customers are trying to make as they think about their digital capability and the next generation of services and policy storage and processing capability they need. [SEP] In fact, we recently signed a significant contract with a major healthcare provider who is leveraging our SQL and Azure datalink solutions to optimize their patient care and outcomes.","3662":"Our operating expenses have increased significantly this quarter and I'd like to provide some additional context around that. As we've continued to grow our business, we've been investing in our people and infrastructure to position ourselves for long-term success. [SEP] But the 51% year-over-year is also \u2013 it's a combination of the hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated forfeiture rate. [SEP] The adjustment to our estimated forfeiture rate was driven by a few factors, including changes in our business outlook and the performance of certain teams. While this adjustment had an impact on our year-over-year increase in operating expenses, we believe it represents a more accurate reflection of our anticipated stock-based compensation expenses going forward. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to manage our expenses while driving continued growth and innovation in our business.","3663":"As we look at our financial performance this past quarter, there are a few key factors that contributed to our growth. [SEP] And I will actually combine these, because really those are fundamental driver that sits underneath this and then we can get to the specifics of end of support. [SEP] But before we dive into that, I want to touch on our strategy for the upcoming quarter and how we plan to maintain this momentum.","3664":"Our product team worked hard to launch new features and products that provided high value to our customers. In addition, our sales team executed well and expanded our customer base in key verticals. [SEP] We couldn't be happier with the level of ASP that we generated in the December quarter. [SEP] Looking ahead, we believe there is potential to further increase our ASP as we continue to add more premium features to our products. We are also exploring ways to bundle our offerings and create more value for our customers. Overall, we are optimistic about our ability to maintain strong ASP levels going forward.","3665":"Moving on to our international segment, we are pleased to report strong growth in sales and revenue in Q2. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, our international team has continued to deliver outstanding results. [SEP] International's 26% FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in three and a half years. [SEP] This growth was driven by a combination of factors, including strong demand for our products in key markets and successful execution of our international expansion strategy. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the long-term potential of our international business and are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong financial results.","3666":"During the quarter, we experienced strong growth in our digital content business, driven by the continued adoption of electronic books and the increase in streaming services. [SEP] We also have issue with digital content, not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited in particular. [SEP] As a result, we have adjusted our pricing strategy to remain competitive and attract new customers while continuing to invest in new and exclusive content. Our goal is to provide the best possible experience for our customers and maximize our revenue potential in this rapidly evolving market.","3667":"As we continue to expand our platform and reach more users, we've seen a significant increase in mobile ad revenue. [SEP] So that's an important on-ramp to mobile advertising for a number of businesses around the world. [SEP] Our team is constantly working to enhance our mobile ad offerings and provide even more value to our advertising partners.","3668":"Now let's move on to some recent initiatives that we have launched to expand our reach and increase accessibility for all of our customers. [SEP] XFINITY put out a voice guide for visual disabilities, and they did this, they did this by doing an Oscar commercial with a girl who is blind imagining what Wizard of Oz characters looked like. [SEP] We are committed to continuing to explore new technologies and initiatives that help break down barriers and make our services accessible to all individuals.","3669":"We've seen some significant changes in user behavior due to the current global situation and the various restrictions that have been put in place. [SEP] So at some level, I do think that the core mission and promise of helping to connect people with their friends and family is very fundamental, right? [SEP] And while we've had to pivot our strategies and adapt to these changes, we remain committed to our core values and purpose.","3670":"During the recent holiday season, we saw significant growth in our sales. Our partnership network played a key role in driving this growth. [SEP] But with all of our partners, we work well in advance of the holiday to get our plans in place. [SEP] This proactive approach has helped us to anticipate and respond to any challenges that may arise. Overall, we are pleased with the success of our holiday sales and look forward to continuing to work closely with our partners to achieve even greater results in the future.","3671":"Our company has been working tirelessly to enhance the safety features of our platform. [SEP] In the last few months, there have already been more than 100 instances where we've been able to reach out and get in touch with first responders that they can give you people the help that they need, and that's a big structural change in the way that we do business in terms of protecting the security and integrity of our community. [SEP] We have also increased the number of employees dedicated to handling safety issues and providing support to our users, especially during emergencies.","3672":"We've seen a lot of progress in our business over the past year. [SEP] And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year. [SEP] Our team is ready to embrace this acceleration and capitalize on the opportunities it presents.","3673":"Now I'd like to talk about our cloud business specifically. [SEP] We continue to see the growth through Azure and the offset to that has been the transactional business. [SEP] Overall, we are confident in our strategy and our ability to drive growth in both areas moving forward.","3674":"Now, turning to our tax strategy for the year. [SEP] As you know, we are the largest U.S. taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full U.S. tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States. [SEP] However, we do have subsidiaries located in countries with lower tax rates, allowing us to legally minimize the taxes we pay on profits earned outside of the United States.","3675":"We have been exploring different avenues to diversify our revenue streams. [SEP] But for the foreseeable future, even within this, ads remains the great focus. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in ad revenue over the past quarter and plan to continue investing in our advertising department.","3676":"We're seeing some really good adoption of video ads as well. [SEP] One is that video is naturally becoming a larger share of the content in News Feed because both people and pages are sharing more videos as a mix and people want to consume that content. [SEP] So we're definitely seeing the trend that there is more consumption and more creation of video content.","3677":"We have made significant investments in digital transformation to improve our business processes. [SEP] As you see business process reinvention occur, I do think of this as the surface through which many people will experience that. [SEP] We will continue to invest in innovative technologies to enhance our customers' experiences and streamline our operations.","3678":"Our company has had some exciting developments in the past quarter with regard to our film and television productions. [SEP] I would say that we've had some particular success in -- recently with 10 Golden Globe nominations and 3 Oscar nominations and Jack Ryan homecoming in season two of the [indiscernible] in particular, were very well received during the quarter. [SEP] Moving forward, we are optimistic about the future of our entertainment division and plan to continue investing in high-quality content and expanding our reach in the industry.","3679":"Our team has been working tirelessly to optimize our supply chain and drive down costs. [SEP] We manage all of the supply chain, all of it is as one supply chain; we do SKU design as one SKU design; we drive costs of both network storage, compute down altogether. [SEP] By integrating our supply chain management and SKU design processes, we are able to streamline operations and deliver products more efficiently to our customers.","3680":"Looking at our financial projections for the upcoming quarter, we anticipate a significant increase in our operating expenses. [SEP] The majority of the increase will continue to come from R&D, given the fact that we\u2019ve expanded our product portfolio and we\u2019re making investments all the time ahead of the revenue that would be generated in the future. [SEP] However, we believe these investments are crucial for staying competitive in the market and driving long-term growth.","3681":"We have been closely monitoring consumer trends and market developments. [SEP] We are factoring that in this year, that\u2019s just something we\u2019re expecting. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to execute our strategy and achieve our financial goals.","3682":"One analyst asked about the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. [SEP] We'll see about Q4 when we talk and everything we know about or anticipate about Q3 is built into our guidance. [SEP] However, we are closely monitoring market trends and may adjust our guidance if necessary.","3683":"We are seeing some exciting developments in our partnership with Whole Foods. [SEP] So, the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime \u2013 those markets using Prime Now. [SEP] We anticipate expanding this benefit to even more cities in the coming months.","3684":"We're continuing to explore new avenues for revenue growth in addition to our core business. One area that we see a lot of potential in is video content and related products. [SEP] We're also investing in things like video, Watch and the like, which have the potential to condition tribute on the revenue side, but still relatively small in perspective of the overall business. [SEP] Of course, we're not putting all our eggs in one basket. We're also investing in the expansion of our existing products and services, as well as exploring new markets and partnerships. But we see video as an exciting growth opportunity that we're eager to explore further.","3685":"We have been closely monitoring the adoption rate of our latest iPhone models. [SEP] Our current estimate is that about 20% of the active installed base has upgraded to a 6 or 6 plus. [SEP] This is in line with our projections and we believe there is still room for growth as we continue to market these models to our customers.","3686":"As we look ahead, we see a tremendous opportunity in the messaging space. Messaging has become the go-to method of communication for many people and businesses, and we believe this trend will continue for years to come. [SEP] And we think, in many ways, we're better positioned than anyone else in the industry to participate in the opportunity that should be there over the long run for businesses and consumers to connect on message. [SEP] To capture this opportunity, we are investing heavily in our messaging platform and building out new features and capabilities. We are also deepening our relationships with businesses to ensure that our platform meets their needs and provides value. Overall, we are excited about the potential of messaging and are confident in our ability to lead the way in this space.","3687":"Our sales team has continued to work diligently to maintain our relationships with key customers and find new opportunities in order to achieve our revenue targets. [SEP] And because frankly we saw that macro weakness, you have even seen it in terms of server shipments, right. [SEP] However, we are optimistic about the future as we have several new product launches and strategic partnerships in the works that we believe will drive growth in the coming quarters.","3688":"One analyst on the call asked about the company's product mix for the upcoming holiday season. [SEP] Of course, we have a very strong mid-tier this year in the portfolio, with 6 and 6 Plus. [SEP] The CEO also mentioned that they have high hopes for the sales of their newer products, such as the XR and XS Max.","3689":"Can you speak to the revenue recognition for the new contract with XYZ Corp? [SEP] Generally, I do think that they will pay us for that, to your specific question. [SEP] We have consulted with our accounting team and they believe we will be able to recognize the revenue for that contract in the next fiscal quarter.","3690":"Looking ahead to the rest of the year, I know there are some uncertainties in the market, but I believe we've taken the necessary steps to mitigate those risks. [SEP] Now the good news is \u2013 the great news from my point of view is I think we're strategically positioned very well [SEP] In fact, I'm confident that we'll continue to see strong growth in our key markets thanks to our commitment to innovation and our talented team.","3691":"We've been able to grow our user base organically through our focus on mobile apps. Our strategy has been to build a unique mobile user experience that keeps our users engaged and coming back for more. [SEP] I don't think we have any large clients, if you look at 25% in the U.S. of consumer media time is on mobile and then 20% of mobile time goes to Facebook and Instagram that would be 5% of U.S. consumer media time. [SEP] And we've been successful in doing that. Our user numbers have been steadily increasing month on month, and we're confident that we'll continue to see growth as we refine our product. As you can see, mobile is the future of media and we're well positioned to take advantage of that trend.","3692":"Now let's turn to our inventory levels. [SEP] So, we feel very good about our channel inventory ranges as we get into the September quarter. [SEP] We will continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory to ensure we are well-positioned for the holiday season.","3693":"Now, let's take a look at our online stores business segment. [SEP] So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex-FX, to be higher than that, but for the adoption ad standard. [SEP] We implemented a new adoption ad standard which resulted in lower revenue growth than we had anticipated.","3694":"We're now going to take some questions from the analysts. [SEP] Just on the user growth point, we're obviously pleased with the growth we're seeing across the globe in terms of DAU growth. [SEP] However, we are aware that we still have a lot of work to do in certain markets and we are continuing to develop strategies to drive user growth in those areas.","3695":"We have seen an increase in usage of our carousel ads feature. [SEP] because it's very specific carousel ads product but it's also a brand play for them as they strengthen their brand and get people to interact with them as they want them to. [SEP] Additionally, we have received positive feedback from our ad partners who have used this product to increase their brand recognition and engagement with their target audience.","3696":"One of the key drivers of our growth this quarter has been the increase in small business adoption of our platform. [SEP] And we see a lot of small businesses really able to do things on the platform. [SEP] We believe this validates our strategy of providing affordable and easy-to-use tools for small businesses to grow and succeed online.","3697":"Our focus for the upcoming quarters will be to increase our developer community and expand our reach in the market. [SEP] So those are the natural places where you'll see us gain more developers and gain more traction. [SEP] We are confident that with the right strategy in place, we will be able to hit our targets and drive incremental growth in the coming months.","3698":"Our new product line has been a major success, driving significant revenue growth over the past quarter. \n- We've been working tirelessly behind the scenes to develop new technology that will revolutionize our industry.

Thank you for your continued support and investment in our company.","3699":"Our team has been working diligently to analyze our performance this quarter and I am pleased to report strong results.

[SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to focus on these areas to drive growth and maintain our position in the market. Additionally, we are exploring new opportunities to enhance our offerings and stay ahead of industry trends. Thank you for your continued support.","3700":"We have plans to overhaul our product offerings and services. [SEP] The biggest job that we have is to show people in the community what's going to be meaningful and important to them, and that is our goal in all of these changes. [SEP] We are committed to listening to feedback and continuing to make improvements that benefit our customers.","3701":"One of the analysts on the call requested more information on Apple's performance with respect to iPhone sales in recent years. [SEP] If you look at iPhone 6 today, and add iPhone 6 Plus and compare that to last year\u2019s 5s we are doing better, at that price point than we were previously. [SEP] However, it's important to note that overall smartphone sales have been declining in the industry, so even though we're doing relatively well, we're still operating in a challenging market. We're constantly looking at ways to innovate and meet consumer demand to stay ahead of the curve.","3702":"Our quarterly earnings report showed a strong performance across all our product lines. [SEP] But it does tend to mask a little some of the ARPU improvement that we've seen, it's still E3 and E5, there\u2019s opportunity on both, although we are starting to see the impact of E5 in net ARPU number. [SEP] We remain optimistic about the potential for continued growth in the coming quarter, as we explore new markets and expand our offerings.","3703":"Now, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our financial performance over the last quarter. [SEP] As we look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think is important to point out. [SEP] First of all, our revenue growth was slightly lower than anticipated due to unexpected market fluctuations.","3704":"Thank you for joining us for our earnings conference call today. [SEP] I often talk about how when we develop new products we think about it in three phases. [SEP] In the first phase, we focus on identifying customer needs and pain points, in the second phase we develop and test potential solutions, and in the third phase we launch and refine the product based on user feedback.","3705":"Our earnings for this quarter have been strong, with significant growth compared to the same period last year. [SEP] We\u2019re obviously benefiting from a strong secular shift to usage of mobile and we feel we\u2019re very well positioned in that. [SEP] In addition to mobile usage, we are also seeing increased adoption of our software in the enterprise market, which we believe will further drive our growth in the coming quarters.","3706":"During the last quarter, our company has focused on advancing our camera technology. [SEP] The big step forward that we announced at F8 is that there are lots of different apps that have cameras in them or that independent developers just build an app that has a single camera effect. [SEP] This has led to an increase in user engagement and we're excited to see how these advancements will continue to drive growth in the coming year.","3707":"We have received several questions from analysts and investors regarding our music streaming services. [SEP] We offer Apple Music on Android, and so there's a series of things that are outside of that. [SEP] However, we remain committed to providing a seamless user experience across all platforms, including Android, iOS, and web.","3708":"We are seeing steady growth in our customer base and are confident in our ability to continue this growth trajectory.

Our cloud-based AI platform has proven to be extremely effective in training various models and allowing for more accurate predictions. Now, with the integration of edge computing, we are able to provide even faster and more efficient results. [SEP] And especially when you take that in combination with AI, again, you train on the cloud and you score on the edge. [SEP] This has been a major factor in our continued success, as our clients are seeing the benefits of increased accuracy and speed in their decision-making processes. We are excited to continue to expand our AI offerings and explore new opportunities in the cloud and edge computing spaces.","3710":"We\u2019ve received several inquiries from our shareholders and the media regarding our company\u2019s stance on data privacy. [SEP] On privacy, there are really important questions about how you define what you want the system to be in terms of how much you\u2019re locking down data versus are you making it portable for to enable competition and innovation and academic research and things like that. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe that finding the right balance between privacy and innovation is key to driving growth and creating value for our stakeholders.","3711":"We are pleased to report solid growth in user numbers and engagement.

[SEP] And so, it\u2019s a huge number, we're very, very proud of that number. [SEP] We attribute a large portion of this growth to the successful launch of our new product line.","3713":"Our marketing team has been working tirelessly to optimize our advertising strategy and target the right audience. [SEP] We do believe that some of our ad success is taking people from demand generation through demand fulfillment. [SEP] This has led to a significant increase in conversions and overall revenue. We plan to continue this approach and explore new ways to attract and engage potential customers.","3714":"Moving on to our metrics, let's talk about our installed base. [SEP] The installed base is growing, hit a new record, that's obviously good. [SEP] However, we still need to focus on increasing user engagement within that base to fully capitalize on its potential.","3715":"Can you walk us through the process of ramping up production for new products? [SEP] Many times they start with subscale volumes and you build them out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density and that creates efficiency. [SEP] So, are you expecting significant cost savings as you continue to scale up production?\"\n\nAnswer: \"Sure. So, when we launch a new product or enter a new market, we typically start with subscale volumes. This allows us to test the waters and see how the product will perform. As we build up volume, we can become more efficient by optimizing our production processes and improving the use of our equipment. This leads to more volume, more package density, and ultimately, greater efficiency. As a result, we expect to see cost savings as we scale up production and achieve greater economies of scale.","3716":"As we look ahead to the next quarter, we are focused on improving our operations and increasing efficiency. We recognize the challenges we have faced in recent months, but we are confident in our ability to turn things around.

We will be investing in new technology and expanding our partnerships to stay ahead of the competition. With a strong team and a solid plan in place, we are optimistic about our future earnings potential.","3717":"We believe that understanding the needs of our customers is crucial to our success. This is why we have partnered with IBM to provide us with valuable insights into various industries and markets.

This has resulted in increased customer satisfaction and a growing reputation as a leading provider in these verticals. We look forward to continuing our partnership with IBM and leveraging their expertise to drive further success for our business.","3718":"We have been actively pursuing acquisitions to strengthen our cybersecurity offerings. And I am pleased to announce that we have recently completed a significant acquisition. [SEP] We bought a company in Colorado that's essentially a firewall on all your identity management. [SEP] We believe this acquisition will provide substantial value to our customers who rely on us to safeguard their data. Our goal is to be the leading provider of comprehensive cybersecurity solutions, and this acquisition brings us one step closer to achieving that goal.","3719":"During the quarter, we invested heavily in our same-day delivery service, which provides added convenience to our customers. We expanded the service to cover more cities and increased the number of products available for same-day delivery. [SEP] And delivering for free in two hours is difficult and expensive, but customers love it. [SEP] We are constantly striving to improve our delivery capabilities while keeping costs in check. We are exploring innovative solutions such as drone delivery and driverless vehicles to make our operations more efficient. Despite the challenges, we remain committed to offering the best delivery experience to our customers.","3720":"We are seeing a growing trend among our clients in the last quarter.

[SEP] And then when you think about the percentage of spend we have, what I said before on this call, which is we only have a small percentage of even our large customers, that's true of our small customers, too. [SEP] But we're confident that as we continue to provide excellent service and add new offerings, we'll be able to increase our percentage of spend across the board.","3723":"Thank you for joining us on this earnings conference call.\n- Our financial results for this quarter have been strong, and we are pleased to share them with you.\n- As you know, our company operates in several regions around the world.

[SEP] And the uniqueness of Windows comes because we don\u2019t think of these services and their application end points as apps, but fundamentally core to the Windows experience. [SEP] As a result, we believe that Windows is not just a platform for applications, but an ecosystem of interconnected services that enable seamless productivity for our users.","3725":"Our company has continued to experience strong growth in revenue and user base over the past quarter.

We are always looking for ways to enhance our offerings and provide the best possible value to our customers, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.","3727":"Our revenue growth this quarter was higher than expected, driven largely by strong performance in our technology segment.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate that our product development efforts will be a key driver of sustained growth and profitability for the company.","3728":"We saw a slight decline in iPad sales for the quarter, but overall it remains a strong contributor to our revenue stream. [SEP] I am still very optimistic and bullish on iPad over the long run, as I\u2019ve indicated before. [SEP] We have several exciting updates and innovations planned for the iPad in the coming year, which we believe will further reinforce its position as a leader in the tablet market.","3729":"We are proud to announce that our company has once again surpassed expectations and achieved record-breaking financial results for this quarter. [SEP] It's essentially set functionality and pace of innovation that we've demonstrated for multiple years.

Our AWS (Amazon Web Services) segment continues to perform exceptionally well and has been a significant contributor to our overall revenue. [SEP] Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. [SEP] This growth in AWS is a testament to the increasing demand we are seeing for cloud computing solutions. We continue to innovate and expand our offerings, which has helped us maintain our leadership position in this space. We are confident that this momentum in AWS will continue in the coming quarters.","3731":"During the past quarter, we have seen significant progress and growth in our various services.\n- Our team has been working hard to improve and enhance our customers' experience with our products and platforms.

[SEP] And Teams in some sense helps them a lot, because it builds on all the rest of the investment they\u2019ve made already in Office 365. [SEP] So, it kind of makes the value proposition of Office 365 even stronger for those customers.","3733":"We've seen a lot of volatility in the global markets. [SEP] And so, with all of these events taking place around the world, there's no one event that we think drives a huge portion of revenue. [SEP] Instead, we believe that the cumulative effect of these events will have an impact on revenue growth over time.","3734":"Can you speak to the competitive landscape of the industry?\"\n\nResponse: \"Sure, our industry is unique in that it's a very fragmented market the world over, especially if you add SMB [SEP] because it's a very fragmented market the world over, especially if you add SMB [SEP] With that being said, are there any specific regions or segments that you see as particularly promising for growth in the near future?","3735":"We have seen strong growth in our delivery services and are continuing to invest in improving our capabilities. [SEP] One is the same-day that you've seen us rollout in number of markets here in the US. [SEP] We believe that offering same-day delivery is essential to remaining competitive in the e-commerce industry and plan to expand this service to even more markets in the coming year.","3736":"We are more focused than ever on our cloud offerings and we believe this will drive growth in the coming quarters. [SEP] Again, I think the way that shows itself in our financial results is you'd expect to continue to see the strong mix shift to the cloud. [SEP] Additionally, we are seeing increased demand from our enterprise clients for cloud-based solutions, which further supports our strategy.","3737":"As we head into the next quarter, we anticipate a drop in sales due to the natural seasonality of our business. [SEP] And we expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and with mix. [SEP] Additionally, we believe our new product line will drive increased sales and provide greater product mix.","3738":"Our Q2 results are a reflection of our team's hard work and dedication to driving growth across our various platforms.

But I am confident that with dedication and perseverance, we can overcome any obstacle.","3740":"Now I'd like to talk about our Music segment. [SEP] You remember that a few years ago, we were actually declining in Music; now with the streaming service in addition to the download business, the business is growing again. [SEP] We're really happy with the growth we're seeing and believe it will continue into the future.","3741":"We're now going to take some questions from analysts on the line. First up is John from Bank of America. [SEP] U.S. and Canada, sort of consistent with past quarters, has been flat at about 185 million, and we would expect that to continue to bounce around. [SEP] However, we are seeing some growth potential in international markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. As a result, we're investing more resources into those regions to capture market share and drive profitability.","3742":"We've seen a significant growth in our user base over the past quarter. [SEP] There a lot of public figures who have pages often with millions or tens of millions of followers producing unique and really high-quality content that they're pushing out to all their fans on the network today. [SEP] As a result of this, we've been able to attract more advertisers who want to partner with these influential users to promote their products and services.","3743":"We're now going to turn our attention to our growth strategies for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] And we think again, this is activities we've been doing already which need to grow at a very rapid rate. [SEP] Our team is excited to roll out some new marketing campaigns and partnerships to drive the growth we're anticipating.","3744":"We've been really pleased with the growth we've seen in this market.

[SEP] Overall, we're optimistic about our prospects for continued success in the region.","3745":"We've had a strong quarter with revenue growth across all our product lines. [SEP] And if you've been tracking that number over time, we're now up over $10 million, which is good progress on that front. [SEP] However, we still have some work to do in improving our operating margins.","3746":"Now, I would like to turn our attention to our product offerings and provide an update on how each of them is performing. [SEP] One of the products that's doing very, very well for us is the store simple product, which is essentially a storage product that cloud Tiers virtualization storage from on-premise to the cloud. [SEP] We are extremely pleased with the success of the store simple product and we believe it has a lot of potential for future growth.","3747":"We're constantly on the lookout for new ways to improve our platform and ensure that our users are getting the most out of it. [SEP] So the thing that we're going to be measuring is basically the number of interactions that people have on the platform and off because of what they're seeing that they report to us is as meaningful. [SEP] This is a key metric for us, and we believe that by measuring these interactions, we can continue to make the necessary improvements to enhance our users' experience.","3748":"Our focus on providing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions has been a major driver of our growth in recent years. [SEP] It's the same case with Schneider Electric or ABB or any one of the customers we are working with because they all are taking some of their assets and converting them into SaaS applications on Azure. [SEP] This trend towards cloud-based solutions is only getting stronger, and we believe that our partnership with Microsoft Azure puts us in a great position to capitalize on it.","3749":"Our revenue has seen significant growth over the past fiscal year. [SEP] So we obviously need to do a great job in continuing to push that, and we're focused on it. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new marketing strategies to reach a wider audience and increase brand awareness.","3750":"During the last quarter, we saw an increase in sales across all of our product lines. [SEP] And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods. [SEP] This expansion is part of our long-term growth strategy and will help us reach new customers and markets.","3751":"We've been analyzing our performance and looking at how we stack up against competitors in the market. One thing that stands out is our profit margins are still lower than we'd like them to be. [SEP] I think that over time, we should be able to do better, but that at least provides this existence proof that despite \u2013 regardless of what our internal logic is of what we're doing, that someone has done it. [SEP] So, while we're not satisfied with our current results, we're confident that with some changes to our business strategy we can improve our financial outlook and become more competitive in the industry.","3752":"We've been investing heavily in our one-day delivery capabilities to make it more convenient for our customers. [SEP] So we will -- we expect it to be very valuable to customers as we add selection into that one-day category. [SEP] We're also continuing to optimize our fulfillment network and logistics to ensure timely delivery and a seamless customer experience.","3753":"Our iPhone sales were strong overall during the quarter, with double-digit growth in many markets around the world. We also saw solid demand for our Mac and iPad products. [SEP] At the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter and so, when we changed some of the configurations, memory configurations in the year-ago quarter. [SEP] However, we expect the iPhone SE to rebound in the coming quarters as we continue to make improvements to its design and features. Additionally, our services and wearables categories performed exceptionally well, with record revenue and strong double-digit growth. Overall, we are confident in the strength of our product portfolio and our ability to continue delivering value to our customers.","3754":"We are really excited about the growth we are seeing in our messaging services.

[SEP] We believe that our continued investment in these services will lead to even more growth and success in the future.","3755":"We launched our new One Day delivery service earlier this quarter. It allows customers to order select items by noon and have them delivered to their doorstep by 9 pm the same day. [SEP] So we\u2019ve built that into our Q4 guidance estimate, but we\u2019re very pleased with the customer response to One Day. [SEP] We believe that One Day will be a key driver of growth for our company in the coming years. We're already seeing strong demand from customers, and we expect that to continue as we expand the service to more regions.","3756":"We are very focused on our cloud strategy and our ability to deliver new offerings through the cloud. We believe that the cloud is the way of the future and that our continued investment in this area will be key to our long-term success. [SEP] It's really the transformation from having applications that are silos to becoming more services in the cloud where you can reason about the activity and the data underneath these services to benefit the customers who are using these services. [SEP] Our cloud offerings have been very well-received by customers, and we are seeing strong growth in this area. We have also been able to enhance our cloud capabilities through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, which have given us access to new technology and expertise. We remain committed to leading the way in cloud services and delivering value to our customers through innovation and excellence.","3757":"Our data center in Dallas is a key component of our global infrastructure. [SEP] The rest of it is continuing to build out in that location the number of servers and networking equipment required. [SEP] We\u2019ve also invested heavily in ensuring that our network connectivity to and from Dallas is among the most reliable and robust in the industry.","3758":"We have noticed a significant surge in our social media and messaging platforms, especially in the last year. [SEP] And the amount that people want to share and communicate is boundless and that's I think partially why we're seeing the growth that we are with so many of these products. [SEP] In fact, our research shows that people are not only communicating more frequently but also with a greater number of individuals. This highlights the need for us to constantly innovate and upgrade our technologies to meet the evolving demands of our users.","3759":"In addition to our financial results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss some of the significant developments that have been happening behind the scenes. [SEP] And then, finally, we're giving people who use the services more choice around privacy, and that's coming both in terms of impacts that could be ongoing from things like GDPR as well as other product options that we're providing that could have an impact on revenue growth. [SEP] We believe that by prioritizing user privacy and providing more options for them in this area, we'll be able to strengthen trust in our services and ultimately fuel future growth.","3760":"We have implemented a new billing software to streamline our invoicing process. [SEP] That does result in a revenue to fall, it will end up in unearned. [SEP] However, we anticipate the long-term benefits of the new software will outweigh this temporary decrease in revenue.","3761":"We have noticed a slight decline in sales over the past quarter and wanted to address some concerns about pricing. [SEP] But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a large number of people pay for the phone by month. [SEP] Additionally, we are always looking at new ways to offer more flexible payment options to our customers.","3762":"Our new product launch has been incredibly successful and has exceeded our expectations. We've seen strong demand from both new and existing customers, and we're well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum. [SEP] I'm seeing it sort of everywhere I go now, and so I think we are in the early days, and it'll keep getting better and better, but I'm really happy with where things are at the moment.

We're also investing in our team and infrastructure to support our growth and ensure we can scale operations effectively. Overall, we're confident in our long-term prospects and optimistic about the opportunities ahead.","3763":"Can you provide some insight into the breakdown of our expenses in opening a new store location? [SEP] Much of our spend is, as you note, on some of the infrastructure to put in place when you pick a location. [SEP] However, we have found that investing in these crucial components leads to a smoother and more efficient store opening process in the long run.","3764":"Can you explain how you expect this new feature to impact revenue for the company? [SEP] Because we think that from a business perspective, we will get some of the value just by having the services be more valuable for businesses and the ad prices that they'll bid in the auction. [SEP] So overall, we're confident that this will be a win-win situation for both our company and our business clients.","3765":"We're seeing incredible growth in our Echo and Alexa products. [SEP] So it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon. [SEP] This engagement then leads to increased sales on Amazon as customers become more integrated into our ecosystem.","3766":"We've noticed a decline in sales during the first quarter of the year. \n- Our revenue for the previous quarter was lower than expected. [SEP] That is the largest element that we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality. [SEP] However, we expect to see an increase in sales during the second and third quarters. \n- Our team is currently working on developing a plan to mitigate the effects of seasonality on our revenue.","3767":"We're constantly looking for ways to enhance the customer experience and optimize our retail presence. [SEP] On the storefront, we're also, as you can see, experimenting with numerous store formats. [SEP] These experiments include pop-up stores, flagship stores, and new store designs that cater to different demographics and geographic locations.","3768":"We've had a lot of interest in our recent product launches and innovations. [SEP] Tests are going well, but it's really early days to talk about that being a significant contributor, so we're working to continue to make those products better and continuing those tests, but it's early. [SEP] In the meantime, we're also focused on driving growth in our core business through increased marketing efforts and expansion into new markets.","3769":"Now, let's discuss our performance in the previous quarter. [SEP] Memory on a sequential basis is about 30 basis points favorable for us going into the December quarter. [SEP] This is largely due to increased demand for our higher-end products and improved manufacturing efficiencies.","3770":"Can you give us an update on your capital expenditures for this year? [SEP] So on CapEx, we are absolutely investing in the infrastructure and 2015 is an investment year, so we are ramping CapEx versus 2014. [SEP] However, beyond 2015, we will be assessing our investment needs and potentially making adjustments to our CapEx strategy based on market conditions and strategic priorities.","3771":"In terms of the iPhone, we saw a year-over-year decline in sales for Q4, which was primarily driven by the timing of the new iPhone launches. Additionally, we saw some impact from the ongoing pandemic, particularly in certain regions. [SEP] The first one is the fact that the launch timing of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse order versus last year, and that has had an effect on Q4 and will have an effect on Q1. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain optimistic about the iPhone's performance in the coming quarters. We have seen strong demand for the new models so far and expect that to continue into Q1 and beyond. Additionally, we are continuing to invest in our services business, which saw strong growth in Q4 and is expected to be a key driver of our overall revenue growth going forward.","3772":"As we continue to invest in improving our platform, we see a huge opportunity in leveraging our vast library of content. [SEP] At some point, we're going to be able to just understand the meaning of all the content that hosted that you could potentially see and use that as candidates to potentially improve your experience and make it that you could see way more content that you might be able to today to \u2013 and of course, we'll do that to help encourage more social interaction. [SEP] In addition, we are exploring ways to incorporate virtual reality and augmented reality into the user experience to further enhance social interaction.","3773":"Thank you for your question. [SEP] And the guidance certainly doesn't imply any type of slowdown in the commercial business. [SEP] In fact, we are seeing strong demand and anticipate continued growth in that segment.","3774":"We have been focused on increasing seller adoption of our platform. [SEP] During the quarter, we rolled out a feature called Tatkal which is a studio on wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign up. [SEP] The response to Tatkal has been positive and we plan on expanding this initiative to more sellers in the coming months.","3775":"Now, turning to our business strategy for the year. [SEP] We've also put a lot of emphasis on our Services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. [SEP] We believe that by focusing on Services and improving the ecosystem, we can better serve our customers and drive growth for the company in the long-term.","3776":"Moving on to our performance in the fourth quarter... [SEP] The second is the first-party hardware, where we just had such terrific performance again this Q4. [SEP] We saw strong demand for our flagship products, particularly in the gaming and entertainment categories.","3777":"Our company has been actively involved in supporting initiatives to combat online misinformation and hate speech. [SEP] And I think that that means that the major Internet platforms have a responsibility to form partnerships and help to fund this work. [SEP] We are committed to doing our part in this effort and will continue to work with industry partners and stakeholders to ensure a safe and healthy online environment for all users.","3778":"Our social media platform has continued to grow and evolve over the years, with millions of daily active users engaging with our app. [SEP] And then on top of that whole ecosystem, we then had the opportunity to build what has turned into a News Feed business that we're really proud of, right. [SEP] The News Feed has become one of the most popular features of our platform, allowing users to stay up to date on the latest news and trending topics from around the world.","3779":"Our team has been working tirelessly to ensure a smooth transition and continued success during this period of growth. [SEP] So, when you look into \u201819, I am optimistic on both of those fronts, good execution continuing on renewals as well as adding new value, new opportunity. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring potential partnerships that could further expand our offerings and increase market share.","3780":"We have seen strong growth in our international sales over the past year, particularly in China. [SEP] Amazon is trusted source of authentic [ph] international products and that\u2019s really what we're doubling down on now with a Amazon global store on our own site, which gives Chinese customers access to over 1 million Amazon products globally. [SEP] The Amazon global store also allows us to increase our presence in the Chinese market and further expand our customer base in the region.","3781":"Thank you for your question about our relationships with third-party vendors. [SEP] We obviously have a lot of people in-house who work with the third-parties on that front. [SEP] As we continue to grow and expand our business, we are constantly evaluating and building upon these partnerships to ensure that we are providing the best possible service to our customers.","3782":"We've seen considerable growth in our sales figures this quarter. [SEP] But there are other stimulus programs as well that likely have an effect to the consumer level. [SEP] Despite some economic uncertainty, we remain optimistic about the rest of the fiscal year.","3783":"Our latest earnings report shows strong growth for our Windows division. [SEP] If you look at even the thing that we're seeing is in terms of engagement, with the browser or things like Xbox Live with the Store, or new device categories like the 2-in-1, all I think make it much more possible for users to engage with Windows in more mobile formats and in more productivity scenarios [SEP] We're continuing to invest in these areas to ensure that Windows remains a leading platform for both consumers and enterprise clients.","3784":"Our goal for the next fiscal year is to improve our profit margins and boost shareholder value.

[SEP] So we will not overspend there in sales and marketing because we do believe the products \u2013 in fact, there is a different way to sell even business process applications because of the cloud, and that's something that we want to take advantage of. [SEP] Instead, we plan on leveraging our cloud-based technology to reach a broader audience and showcase the benefits of our products through demonstrations and webinars.","3787":"Our Q2 earnings report shows strong growth in revenue and earnings per share. [SEP] As you're seeing EGM strength across a lot of the categories there, there was no single category we're really calling out, but continue to see good selection growth and good Prime growth as well. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued EGM strength and a boost in overall growth thanks to our investments in supply chain and logistics.","3788":"Our team of developers has been hard at work on new features to enhance user experience.

[SEP] And so, as we continue to grow, quickly that is going to help us as we go through the year. [SEP] We anticipate this growth will also strengthen our position in the industry and attract more investors.","3790":"We have received a lot of questions from investors regarding our revenue projections for the next quarter. [SEP] So there\u2019s a lot of granularity that goes into thinking about how revenue will progress that ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on the supply and demand characteristics in that given quarter when we do that and we see that we expect constant currency deceleration. [SEP] Despite this, we remain confident in our ability to meet our full-year revenue guidance.","3791":"We have noticed a trend of lower demand for our products over the past few months, and this has led to a decrease in our sales figures. As a result, we are anticipating a deceleration in revenue growth for the next quarter. [SEP] So I think we're going to see the deceleration impact all regions. [SEP] However, we are taking steps to address this issue by implementing cost-cutting measures and pursuing new marketing strategies. We are confident that these actions will help us weather the current economic climate and emerge stronger in the long run.","3792":"Now let's turn our attention to our upgrade rates for the quarter. [SEP] The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. [SEP] However, we have implemented strategies to mitigate the impact and we remain confident in our ability to drive growth in the coming quarters.","3793":"We have time for one more question. [SEP] And I think if you look at a large base of businesses who use us without paying, the growing base of businesses who do pay us and then the runway we have in services that are 1 billion plus (59:48) that we're really not monetizing, I think a strong focus on ads continues to be the best investment we can make. [SEP] Thank you for your question. We will move on to the next caller.","3794":"Our strategy for the upcoming quarter is focused on increasing our market share. We've identified some areas where we can improve our pricing and product offerings. [SEP] We want to be able to make sure that we compete on all price points and overall grow the volume.

[SEP] We are thrilled to see this growth, as it shows that our business strategy is working and that we are meeting the needs of our customers.","3797":"We now turn to the growth drivers for Intelligent Cloud, starting with our Azure business. [SEP] We already have 20 plus points of, or 20%-plus of VMs in Azure are Linux, and we'll all increasingly have Linux be a big share of our percentage of what is happening in Azure. [SEP] We are seeing more enterprises looking to move their workloads to the cloud, and many of these workloads run on Linux.","3798":"Thank you for your question, Heather. I think there's no doubt that AI and machine learning are transforming the way we do business. [SEP] And Heather, I would add that when you're using systems to look at content, when you're using AI machine learning systems, it's a real benefit to have actual people looking and tagging that content, classifying it or identifying it because it actually improves the accuracy of the AI system. [SEP] That's why we've made a significant investment in our workforce to make sure we have the right people in place to do that. And I think that investment is already paying off in terms of the quality of our AI-driven recommendations and insights.","3799":"In terms of our operations, one area that has been a focus for us has been optimizing our warehouse efficiencies. This has been a long-term goal of ours, and we've been investing heavily in technologies to make our warehouses more efficient. [SEP] We had very high expectations for Amazon Robotics and its impact on our warehouse cost structure and we have been very pleasantly surprised by the job being done on that by that team. [SEP] As a result of these efforts, we're seeing great progress in reducing our operating costs in the warehouse. We believe Amazon Robotics has played a key role in this success, by allowing us to streamline our operations and manage inventory more effectively. We're excited to continue investing in this technology and finding new ways to drive efficiency across our entire network.","3800":"Can you explain the approach you took in moderating content on your platform?

Overall, we're pleased with the continued growth and performance of our advertising business.","3878":"Can you give us an update on your plans for capital expenditures? [SEP] And I think that the rate of CapEx growth, as I said in FY\u201919 will moderate, that happens because of course we\u2019re doing some replacement overall. [SEP] But overall, we're still committed to investing in our technology infrastructure to stay competitive in the market.","3879":"Now let's take a look at our performance in emerging markets. [SEP] Our performance in emerging markets although it\u2019s quite good and our revenue was good our market share is low and the LTE penetration in these markets is quite low. [SEP] However, we have identified strategies to increase our market share and accelerate LTE adoption in these markets.","3880":"We are pleased to report strong financial results for the last quarter. [SEP] And also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter.

We anticipate this trend to continue throughout the rest of the fiscal year.","3881":"Now I'd like to turn to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] So we did see a little bit of improvement in terms of growth rate acceleration versus last couple of quarters.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we remain focused on continuing this positive momentum and delivering value to our stakeholders.","3885":"Our overall revenue for the quarter was impressive, driven largely by strong sales across our product lines. [SEP] And so that\u2019s iPad, it\u2019s Mac and those are huge numbers as well.

We continue to see strong growth across all of our platforms, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. [SEP] So what we want to do is get marketers to use our tools, use the technology we have to do automatic placements, show people things they're interested in, so ads are a good experience, but really help them ring the cash registers so that they know their dollars or their pound or their euro are well spent, and that's what we're pushing to do. [SEP] We've been working hard on improving our targeting capabilities, and we're seeing some great results from that.

We're confident that we're on the right track, and we're looking forward to continuing to grow our business in the coming quarters.","3889":"I'd like to address the impact of the recent accounting methodology change on our Europe segment. As you may know, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard which shifted the timing of our revenue recognition. [SEP] The accounting methodology change did affect how Europe sequential growth rate came in, but really stable if you kind of take that aside.

We have a strong pipeline of new partnerships and product offerings that we believe will drive growth in this region. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets for the year.","3890":"We have seen a lot of questions about our upgrade rates for the upcoming year. [SEP] I think the upgrade rate is a function of many, many different things, from the size of the installed base, the age of the installed base, the product that is new at the time, the regional distribution, the upgrade plans that are in various markets around the world. [SEP] Of course, we will continue to monitor these various factors and make adjustments as necessary in order to maximize the upgrade rate and ensure long-term growth for our company.","3891":"Now let's take a look at our staffing numbers. [SEP] While we're on this subject of head count, head count grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. [SEP] This is a significant increase, but it was necessary to support our growth initiatives and meet the demands of our customers.","3892":"As we continue to grow and expand our offerings, we are constantly evaluating new ways to reach our audiences and provide them with the content they want. In recent months, we have seen a significant increase in demand for streaming services, particularly among younger demographics. This has sparked a lot of internal discussion about the possibility of launching our own streaming platform. [SEP] And that I think is really what gives us even the permission to think about streaming. [SEP] Of course, there are many factors to consider when it comes to streaming - from licensing agreements and content acquisition to marketing and distribution strategies. However, we believe that our unique position in the market and our existing relationships with key players in the industry will give us a competitive advantage as we explore this new venture.","3893":"I want to address the recent concerns about our direction and focus.

Rest assured, we have taken steps to mitigate these risks and remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Thank you for your question.","3897":"We are pleased to announce strong revenue growth for the past quarter. Our total sales increased by 15% compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by strong demand for our core products. [SEP] I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25. [SEP] This move was intended to drive sales growth by making our products more accessible to all customers, regardless of order size. While this may have impacted our profit margins slightly, we believe that the long-term benefits of increased customer loyalty and market share are well worth the investment. We look forward to continuing to innovate and drive growth in the coming quarters.","3898":"One of our key strategic priorities is to identify those areas where we can become one of those ubiquitous utilities. We believe that by focusing on these areas, we can achieve significant growth and long-term success.

We are also actively seeking partnerships and collaborations with other companies in order to expand our reach and accelerate our progress. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our goals and create value for our shareholders.","3899":"Now let's move on to our productivity strategy for this quarter.

[SEP] However, the good news is that our sales numbers have been strong and we anticipate even more growth in the coming months.","3901":"Another trend we're seeing is an increased use of video content on social media platforms. [SEP] Because in a lot of ways, I think if you take a video of yourself and your family out trick-or-treating, that's more engaging than a photo and a better representation of that than writing it out in text. [SEP] This is why we've been investing heavily in video production and incorporating it into our marketing strategy.","3902":"We understand the importance of transparency and privacy in the digital age. As such, we have been working towards providing our users with more control over their data.

We will continue to listen to feedback from our users and make adjustments as needed.","3903":"We've received a lot of questions from shareholders about our stance on privacy in light of recent data breaches and controversies surrounding tech giants. [SEP] We view that privacy is a fundamental human right and that it's an extremely complex situation if you're a user to understand a lot of the user agreements and so forth.

[SEP] We've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners.

[SEP] Our team is focused on improving user experience and expanding our offerings to further capture the market opportunity in China.","3907":"Our sales team has been working hard to test different marketing strategies and we are pleased with the positive feedback we received from the latest campaign.

Despite our efforts to negotiate and come to a mutually beneficial solution, our partner took some aggressive actions that impacted our financial performance. [SEP] In addition to that, as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld $1 billion in payments that they owed us. [SEP] Despite the setback with our partner, we remain committed to our growth strategy and believe that we have a strong foundation in place to weather these challenges.

In fact, over the past quarter, we've had over a million different advertisers purchase ads across our various platforms. [SEP] And that's pretty cool because I don't think there are probably 1 million advertisers who have bought TV ads in that same period of time. [SEP] Of course, this isn't to say that traditional TV advertising is dead - far from it. But it does demonstrate just how much the advertising landscape is changing, and how important it is for businesses to keep up.

[SEP] And so we offer all of those and I don't see us deviating from that approach. [SEP] Thank you for your insight on that. Moving on to the next question...","4029":"Let's shift our focus to the Asia-Pacific region. \n2. Moving on to factors that impacted our performance in APAC.\n3. Before we dive into the numbers, there's one thing we need to address \u2013 the SIM card registration requirement in Indonesia. [SEP] Indonesia had a SIM card registration requirement that caused a little bit of a headwind in APAC. [SEP] Despite this, our overall revenue in APAC remained relatively steady.\n2. We're optimistic that the SIM card registration requirement in Indonesia will have little to no impact on our future earnings.\n3. This requirement is a temporary hurdle that we are actively working to navigate.","4030":"Now, moving on to our product segments, let's talk about our latest financial results. [SEP] We've got a lot of momentum on iPad and Mac because we refreshed the lineups of those products. [SEP] We're seeing an increase in demand for both products, especially as more people are working and learning remotely.","4031":"We have received a number of questions regarding the security of our products and services. [SEP] There are no (46:55) 365 in security, and that's all in, for example, this new suite that we have just announced called E5, the secure lock box. [SEP] We are focused on continually improving our security measures to ensure the highest level of protection for our customers' data.","4032":"When asked about our outlook for the Indian market, I would say that we remain very optimistic. [SEP] So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to occur for Indian consumers and sellers, and that will continue. [SEP] We have made significant investments in the region and have seen strong growth, particularly in our e-commerce business.","4033":"During the second quarter, we experienced some financial setbacks due to unforeseen circumstances in the industry. [SEP] So we're continuing to invest and we're seeing increased CapEx in 2019, albeit at a much slower growth rate than we had in 2018. [SEP] However, we believe that our current investments will position us well for future growth and expansion.","4034":"Our social media platforms have continued to perform exceptionally well this quarter. We have experienced strong growth in our advertising efforts, particularly on Instagram. [SEP] On Instagram, we have 25 million Instagram business profiles, of which 2 million are advertisers. [SEP] This growth can be attributed to our continued investment in improving the platform's user experience for businesses. In addition, we have expanded our ad targeting capabilities to better reach relevant audiences. As a result, we expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","4035":"Now I would like to discuss our company's financial performance for the current fiscal year. [SEP] On a percentage growth basis, we are lapping some very strong growth in the first half of last year. [SEP] Despite the challenge of lapping such strong growth, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver solid results.","4036":"We're very excited to announce a significant investment in our operations in India. [SEP] So, this $1 billion investment will help to enable $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports by 2025. [SEP] We believe that by expanding our presence in India, we can better serve our customers while also contributing to the growth of the Indian economy.","4037":"Can you speak to the factors driving your growth in customer acquisition?\"\n\nResponse: \"Absolutely. I think one of the key drivers is our ability to support a variety of businesses, not just large enterprises but also smaller businesses that may not have as much resources or technical expertise. We're seeing a trend of knowledge workers transitioning to frontline workers and our platform is designed to support both groups seamlessly. [SEP] So it's that combination of things going from knowledge workers to first-line going and the ability to reach all sizes of businesses is what's going to continue to help us I think have overall seat growth or socket growth. [SEP] Thanks for that insight. Can you share any specific initiatives or strategies you have in place to target small businesses and frontline workers?","4038":"We've also been focusing on expanding our digital presence. [SEP] So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well. [SEP] In addition to that, our international sales have been on the rise.","4039":"We are pleased to report strong earnings this quarter, with revenue growth exceeding our expectations. Our team has successfully executed our strategic plan, driving customer acquisition and expanding product offerings. [SEP] But there are also elements that are not entirely under our control like foreign exchange. [SEP] Despite our success, we recognize that there are external factors that create uncertainty in our outlook. In particular, currency fluctuations have been a challenge for us this past year, impacting our bottom line. We will continue to monitor this closely and adjust our plans accordingly.","4040":"During the earnings conference call, the CEO discussed the company's performance in the first half of the year. [SEP] That is going well since we started rolling that out after F8, I think Dave may have mentioned this earlier, but in case you didn\u2019t just to emphasize this point I think part of the \u2013 our strong performance over the first half of this year, a meaningful part of our overperformance compared to what we had expected is because of strength and engagement in the Facebook app over that period. [SEP] As we continue to invest in user engagement and improve our platform, we are confident in our ability to sustain this strong performance for the rest of the year and beyond.","4041":"We have reevaluated our program costs and have implemented some changes to make it more efficient. [SEP] This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program. [SEP] We are confident that these changes will lead to higher profitability in the long run.","4042":"Our success is not just based on our own performance, but also the performance of our ecosystem of partners. [SEP] So when we win, we win together with our vendor partners and also our seller partners. [SEP] That's why we continue to invest in building strong relationships with our partners and collaborating closely with them to deliver value to our customers.","4043":"We've been closely monitoring the impact of our recent pricing changes on our customer base. As we've previously discussed, we made the decision to increase our subscription rates in order to align with the value our products provide. This change has had a noticeable impact on our financial results. [SEP] So, the largest impact -- favorable impact from that at least from a subscription revenue standpoint would have happened in the subsequent four quarters, less in Q2, more in Q3 through Q2 of this year. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our subscription business. While we saw some headwinds in the earlier part of the year due to the price increase, we're now seeing the benefits of that decision pay off. Looking ahead, we anticipate that our subscription revenue will continue to be a key driver of growth for our company.","4044":"We are pleased to report strong financial results for the year 2015. [SEP] I mentioned that we expect the factors that drove the performance in 2015 to continue to drive the performance in 2016. [SEP] As we move forward into 2016, we are committed to executing our strategic initiatives and delivering value to our shareholders.","4045":"Our video messaging platform has seen significant growth in the past quarter, with a 20% increase in daily users. We have also introduced new features such as live streaming and improved video quality. [SEP] So we think it's a very attractive platform for people to reach people with video messages. [SEP] To capitalize on this growth, we are investing in expanding our server capacity and hiring additional software engineers. We also plan to partner with popular social media influencers to promote our platform and reach a wider audience.","4046":"Our Prime membership numbers have continued to grow each quarter, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. [SEP] Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. [SEP] In addition to our existing benefits, we are exploring new offerings such as healthcare services and financial planning tools to further enhance the Prime experience for our members.","4047":"Can you give us some more context behind the revenue numbers you just reported? [SEP] The way to really think about that number just because of some of the seasonality in our business, Mark, is to think about the year-over-year growth rate of 70%. [SEP] And do you expect that growth rate to continue into next quarter?\"\n\nFull statement: \"Can you give us some more context behind the revenue numbers you just reported? The way to really think about that number just because of some of the seasonality in our business, Mark, is to think about the year-over-year growth rate of 70%. And do you expect that growth rate to continue into next quarter?","4048":"We've been facing some challenges with our ad targeting and measurement capabilities,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] So, each of these factors limits our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform, and that can negatively impact our advertising revenue growth. [SEP] However, we're actively working on improving these areas and are confident that we'll be able to provide better ad solutions for our clients in the near future,\" added the Chief Revenue Officer.","4049":"Our cloud services division has been a major source of growth for our company over the past year. [SEP] You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. [SEP] We've been able to achieve this through a combination of increased efficiency in our operations and continued investment in new technologies.","4050":"We had a strong quarter and our results exceeded expectations. We continue to see growth in our key markets and our product line expansion is gaining traction. [SEP] All of those things I think, it\u2019s not really about the pace, it is much about the progress and demand and meeting those things as closely as we can and I feel really good about the team's execution. [SEP] We remain focused on delivering value to our customers and investing in the future success of the company. Our innovation pipeline is robust and we are committed to bringing new solutions to market. Overall, we are confident in our ability to sustain our positive momentum and drive profitable growth.","4051":"Can you elaborate on how television is evolving in the digital age? [SEP] So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best or at least from my perspective, TV shows that we see folks like Jimmy Fallon breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed over social media and on the Internet in three-minute to five-minute or seven-minute segments which are more of what people want when browsing through News Feed. [SEP] Do you think this trend will continue in the future?\"\n\n\"Well, it's certainly been fascinating to see how traditional television has adapted to the digital age. One of the most interesting things we've noticed is that many of the most popular shows are now being broken up into smaller segments for social media and online consumption. Take Jimmy Fallon's show, for example. Rather than airing full episodes, he's now breaking up his show into shorter clips that can be easily shared on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These clips are typically between three to five minutes or seven minutes in length, which is more in line with what people want when they're casually scrolling through their News Feed. It's clear that people want bite-sized pieces of entertainment that they can easily consume on their mobile devices, and that's a trend we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.","4052":"We're really excited about the new technologies we're developing and we feel like we're making great progress. [SEP] Some of the know-how that we have from Xbox is not just about the Xbox, but it's going to help developers across the board. [SEP] We believe that sharing our expertise and resources with developers will ultimately lead to better gaming experiences for everyone. We're committed to continuing to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible in the gaming industry.","4053":"Now I'd like to turn it over to our CFO to walk you through the financials. [SEP] In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4 and, you know, if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in our emerging markets as we expand our product offerings.","4054":"I'd like to now discuss our advertising revenue for the quarter. [SEP] These are one of the fastest-growing ad formats in our family, especially with SMBs in markets like APAC, but really across the board. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in revenue from these ad formats, and we expect this trend to continue as more businesses utilize our platform for their advertising needs.","4055":"We have had a challenging year, as the pandemic has drastically changed the business landscape for us. [SEP] So to me us going in fact to these new secular growth opportunities while being disruptive to the status quo of anyone who has high margins and very high price monolithic products today is basically our strategy going forward. [SEP] Our focus will be on innovation and delivering value to our customers through these new opportunities, even if it means taking risks and shaking up the industry.","4056":"Our focus on growing our first-party devices business has been a key part of our strategy over the past few years. [SEP] We clearly are going to have premium first-party portfolio, and you've seen some of the numbers, some of the progress we have made in Surface. [SEP] And we're going to continue to invest in this area to drive growth and innovation across our hardware products.","4057":"I'd like to now discuss our financial performance for the fiscal year. [SEP] Keep in mind that this year had 13 weeks, last year had 14 weeks. [SEP] Adjusting for this difference, our revenue for this year actually increased by 8% compared to last year's 13 weeks.","4058":"Our research and development team have been working tirelessly to improve the Windows experience and I am excited to share with you some of our latest developments. [SEP] So that's the combination of things that we think are going to play out effectively and of course we're in beta right now or previews right now and getting daily feedback across the length and breadth of Windows 10, but overall I am very optimistic of what it means, both as a platform as well as a set of end user features. [SEP] We have also seen strong early adoption of Windows 10, with millions of users upgrading in just the first few weeks of availability. We will continue to monitor feedback and make improvements to ensure that Windows 10 remains a top-performing platform for years to come.","4059":"We've been focused on improving our advertising strategy in recent months. [SEP] Part of it's about finding the right format, so it's getting the video units there for the people for whom video ads are going to make sense. [SEP] We're also working on identifying audience segments that are most engaged with video content, so we can better target our efforts.","4060":"Now moving on to our revenue breakdown for the quarter. [SEP] So that was a second component of the revenue piece, but the larger component was the XP reversion and again that's not an ASP comment. [SEP] We saw an uptick in XP reversion due to a successful marketing campaign targeting lapsed customers.","4061":"Our R&D budget for next year is expected to increase by 10% compared to this year. We believe that investing in R&D is crucial for our growth strategy. [SEP] There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market, and so that's a part of it. [SEP] However, we also allocate a significant portion of our R&D budget to improving and enhancing our existing products to meet the changing consumer demands. This approach allows us to remain competitive in the market while also exploring new product lines.","4062":"Our Q4 earnings reflect a strong performance across all aspects of our business, with total revenue reaching a record high. [SEP] Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling driven by our FBA program. [SEP] Looking ahead, we believe that the continued growth of our FBA program and investment in capacity will help us to meet increasing customer demand and further drive our business forward.","4063":"We're seeing continued growth in iPhone sales, driven by strong demand for our latest models. [SEP] It's also true that there's some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great too. [SEP] We believe that the combination of our innovative hardware, software, and services, along with our unmatched customer experience, is what sets the iPhone apart in the market.","4064":"Our investments in technology and operations have allowed us to accelerate our growth and improve customer experience. [SEP] We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. [SEP] As we continue to scale, we are confident that our technology and infrastructure will enable us to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","4065":"Our focus on innovation and developing cutting-edge technology has enabled us to stay ahead of the competition in key areas like cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT). [SEP] because it takes one of the bigger growth areas we have in Azure, it's IoT but it's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data. [SEP] We're also investing heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to ensure our customers have the most advanced tools to analyze and make sense of the data generated by IoT devices.","4066":"In the past quarter, we have seen a significant increase in the number of subscribers to our Office suite of products. Our focus on improving the user experience and offering more value-added features has resonated well with our customers. [SEP] But overall, the way we have thought about it is, we want to make sure the Office subscription, both to consumers as well as to enterprise subscribers, is valuable across all their devices . [SEP] To this end, we have been investing heavily in cross-platform compatibility and ensuring seamless integration between devices. Our upcoming update to Office 365 will offer even more tools for collaboration and productivity, further enhancing the value proposition for our subscribers. We remain committed to delivering the best possible experience for our users, and we are confident that our continued investment in the Office suite will drive growth for years to come.","4067":"Our team has been working hard to analyze and improve our business operations over the past few months. [SEP] I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. [SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to monitor market trends and make strategic decisions to drive further growth and profitability.","4068":"We anticipate that our quarterly earnings will continue to grow steadily, but I must emphasize that this is subject to change. As you all know, the pandemic has caused considerable uncertainty throughout the industry. [SEP] So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do recall. [SEP] Therefore, we may need to revise our projections as new information becomes available. Please keep in mind that we will provide updates as soon as possible. Our priority is to maintain transparency with our investors and ensure the long-term success of our company.","4069":"During the past quarter, our company has seen an increase in the engagement of our mobile apps and online shopping platforms. Our team has been focused on enhancing the user experience and improving our product offerings. [SEP] So in shopping in general, we do see a lot of interest in our apps and shopping. [SEP] Additionally, we have noticed a significant shift in consumer behavior towards online shopping and contactless transactions. We believe this trend will continue to grow in the coming months and are strategically investing in our digital capabilities to meet the changing needs of our customers. As a result of these efforts, we are confident in our ability to drive continued growth and revenue in this area.","4070":"Now, moving on to our customer base and sales figures. [SEP] Customer accounts, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year and sellers \u2013 number of sellers is up 250% year-over-year. [SEP] This growth in our customer and seller base is a testament to the strength of our platform and our continued efforts to offer the best possible experience for both parties.","4071":"As we look to the future, we are focused on scaling our cloud offerings and expanding our hybrid capabilities. Our goal is to provide our customers with a seamless and efficient experience across their various IT environments. [SEP] It's really about growing the cloud, growing the hybrid, and then whatever happens in the Transactional business happens. [SEP] While we remain committed to our Transactional business, we understand the shifting landscape and are investing heavily in our cloud and hybrid solutions. We believe this positions us well for long-term growth and success in the market.","4072":"Can you elaborate on how you're measuring the success of your platform adoption strategy? [SEP] In terms of measurement, your question is important because it's not just getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers. [SEP] We are also closely tracking engagement metrics such as time spent on our platforms and user retention rates to ensure that our efforts are driving meaningful interactions with consumers.","4073":"We continue to experience strong growth in our annuity business. As I mentioned earlier, our annuity sales were up 12% year over year, and we expect this trend to continue. [SEP] But in general, that business, unlike the quiet upgrades that we see, just because so much of the business is already on annuity, you don't see that type of incremental impact in an in-quarter release. [SEP] However, we are confident that over time, the impact of our annuity business will be significant. We continue to invest in this area and are exploring new products and partnerships to further accelerate growth. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made and remain committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders.","4074":"Our focus on quality has been a key driver of our success this quarter. We've seen strong customer satisfaction scores across all of our product lines. [SEP] And a lot of the product innovations and investments I've been talking about on this call feed into quality. [SEP] As we look ahead to next quarter, we're confident that our continued investments in quality will lead to even stronger results. We'll be rolling out several new products and features, all with a focus on delivering the highest quality experiences to our customers.","4075":"Our team is working diligently to ensure that we continue to provide the highest quality of service to our customers and meet their evolving needs. [SEP] Yeah, we're very happy with the results we're seeing, and the backlog that we see, and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. [SEP] As we look ahead, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects and confident in our ability to deliver value to our shareholders.","4076":"During the third quarter, our international expansion efforts continued to gain momentum. [SEP] You may see that -- may have seen we have launched Prime in United Arab Emirates this quarter. [SEP] We are pleased to report that our investment in this region is already paying off, as we have seen strong uptake of our Prime membership program in the UAE. We remain committed to investing in and expanding our global reach in the coming quarters to drive sustained growth and value for our shareholders.","4077":"We have seen continued growth in our commerce verticals throughout the quarter [SEP] Our overall commerce efforts go across not just Instagram but Facebook and all of our properties, and our goal is to make it more convenient and accessible and secure for people and business to browse, discover, buy and sell. [SEP] Additionally, we are investing in new features and technologies to enhance the shopping experience for our users.","4078":"Now let's move on to discuss our performance in the content division. [SEP] On the content side, I will say that one of the factors in the sequential guidance Q2 to Q3 being lower, is two things. [SEP] First, we experienced some delays in the production of several projects as a result of COVID-19 related restrictions. Second, we made a strategic decision to reallocate resources towards developing new, higher-margin original content, which has temporarily impacted our output in the short-term.","4079":"We've seen some really impressive growth in our tech division over the past quarter and I think a big part of that is due to our continued focus on innovative products and exceptional customer experience. [SEP] So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more. [SEP] Of course, as with any new product launch, there have been some minor hiccups along the way, but I'm confident that we'll be able to address them quickly and ensure that our customers are always getting the best possible experience from our products.","4080":"Our company experienced a surge in revenue this quarter, primarily due to our partnership with a major tech conglomerate. [SEP] Because we serve a significant number of customers in the Apple Store who want the iPhone when it's new and when it comes out [SEP] As such, we anticipate continued growth opportunities as the tech industry continues to innovate and produce new, in-demand products.","4081":"We are proud to announce our latest quarterly earnings report. [SEP] We are the largest community of sports fans in the world; we have 650 million sports fans on our platform. [SEP] This growth in our user base has led to significant increases in revenue for the company.","4082":"We have some exciting new product launches coming up. [SEP] And -- but we're right now we're really focused on getting these four out there. [SEP] Once those are successfully launched, we can start exploring other potential product lines.","4083":"We are excited to announce that our company has made significant progress in expanding its service offerings. [SEP] It has connections to the video and kind of live content services that we're building out. [SEP] We believe that this connection will further enhance the user experience and drive increased engagement with our platform.","4084":"Another area of growth for our company has been in our social media platform. [SEP] And so we've worked on branded content, the ability to tag a sponsor and share posts and insights. [SEP] This has led to increased engagement from our audience and a higher return on investment for our sponsors.","4085":"Our vision for the future is to create social spaces that are more than just a platform for communication. [SEP] They can be places where you can hang out and feel more present with people, where you can connect to different groups in different ways, interact with businesses and do payments and commerce. [SEP] We believe that by fostering a sense of community and facilitating meaningful interactions, our platform can become a central hub for people's social lives.","4086":"We've been really focused on creating an open and encouraging online environment for our users. [SEP] Because even if you have all of the internet connectivity and the products and the legal framework that you need, if you don't feel safe saying what you want to express, then you're probably not going to share it. [SEP] That's why we've made significant investments in implementing strong security measures and developing community guidelines that prioritize respect and inclusivity. We want our platform to be a place where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions without fear of harassment or intimidation.","4087":"Now let's talk about our upgrade rate for the iPhone. Steve, do you have any questions or observations on this particular metric? [SEP] When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that it\u2019s a low number because that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year. [SEP] However, we believe that the upcoming release of the iPhone 7 will drive a significant change in this number as people will be excited about the new features and improvements. We are confident that the iPhone 7 will be a big hit with our customers and will lead to a higher upgrade rate in the coming months.","4088":"Moving on to our digital marketing strategy, I'm excited to share with you some recent successes. [SEP] And you heard my Live Nation example earlier where we are able to connect Facebook ads and our platform directly to ticket sales. [SEP] We've also been experimenting with Instagram ads, and have seen a 20% increase in conversions compared to traditional online ads.","4089":"In terms of our acquisition strategy, we've been focused on expanding our portfolio of businesses. [SEP] Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly-differentiated customer experience, and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. [SEP] We believe that by acquiring companies with these qualities, we can not only accelerate our growth but also improve the overall quality of our offerings.","4090":"Now turning to our Windows division, I'd like to discuss our recent strategy shift towards a Windows-as-a-service model. [SEP] because in some sense we've taken a very different approach with this Windows-as-a-service even when it comes to OEM relations and how they're able to co-create the products with us. [SEP] This approach has resulted in more innovative and collaborative products, and we anticipate continued success in this area.","4091":"Our team had a strong quarter, and we are proud of the progress we have made towards our goals. However, there were a few challenges we faced that impacted our performance. [SEP] In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. [SEP] We are confident that we have addressed the supplier issue, and we are working to ensure that it does not happen again in the future. Despite the iPad shortage, we still managed to exceed our revenue expectations for the quarter and we are optimistic about the rest of the year.","4092":"Our earnings report shows impressive growth from last year. [SEP] As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. [SEP] We attribute our success in 2019 to our team's tireless efforts and focus on delivering exceptional value to our customers.","4093":"Our virtual reality platform, Oculus, has had an exciting year of growth. We've made strides in improving the user experience, with advancements in graphics and hardware capabilities. We've also increased our content library, with over 200 games and experiences now available on the platform. [SEP] Then when they're starting to get to be more units, just like every other major computing platform before that, what we expect is that a large portion of what people do in it will be communication and social behavior, and that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to, I think, build the best experiences. [SEP] We believe that virtual reality has the potential to be the next major computing platform, and we're committed to investing in its growth and development. We're excited to see how users will continue to use it for everything from gaming to education to social interactions. And we're confident that with Facebook's expertise, we can continue to build the best experiences for our users.","4094":"Our earnings for this quarter reflect a strong performance across all of our business segments. [SEP] So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue expanding the reach and appeal of our Prime program, and expect it to remain a key driver of customer engagement and loyalty.","4095":"We\u2019re seeing strong growth in our video offerings, which have become increasingly important to our customers. Our teams have been investing heavily in this area and we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. [SEP] It\u2019s also probably worth mentioning that video is within a bunch of our products. [SEP] As we look to the future, we see even more opportunities to leverage video across our product suite. Whether it\u2019s through live streaming, on-demand content, or interactive experiences, we believe video will continue to play a significant role in our business. We\u2019re excited to keep exploring ways to enhance the value we bring to our customers through this powerful medium.","4096":"Now let's take a look at some specific industries where we have seen great success with our targeted marketing strategies. [SEP] So for example for the telecom industry being able to target existing consumers with new consumers with people who are -- their voice plan or data plan\u2019s about to expire. [SEP] This has led to significant increases in contract renewals and new plan sign-ups, driving revenue growth for our telecom clients.","4097":"I want to start off today's call by thanking all of you for joining us for our quarterly earnings report.\n- Before we get to Q4 results, I want to give a brief update on some important initiatives we've been working on over the past few months. [SEP] As you probably saw from the press release, we had a good Q4, where we did almost doubled, or double what we did last year. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth and strong performance in Q1 as we execute on our strategic plan.\n- I want to end on a high note by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication, and our shareholders for their continued support. Thank you all and have a great day.","4098":"Our focus this year has been on delivering innovative products and solutions to our customers. We're proud to report that we've made significant progress in achieving these objectives, particularly in relation to our SQL and Windows Server 2016 releases. [SEP] We did and we're encouraged by the customer reaction, even our transactional customers, to the security and management value prop as well as the hybrid nature of our SQL and Windows Server 2016 releases that have taken place this year. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain committed to delivering value to our customers through ongoing investments in our technology and product offerings. We believe that our focus on security and hybrid solutions will continue to resonate with our customer base and enable us to drive growth in the years to come. Thank you for your continued support.","4099":"Our team has been working hard to improve our delivery options for our customers. [SEP] But this is all about the core free Two-Day offer morphing into - or evolving into a free One-Day offer. [SEP] We believe this change will significantly enhance the customer experience and increase loyalty to our brand.","4100":"We have been closely tracking the usage patterns of smartphone users across different demographics. [SEP] Two out of three smartphone users check their phone as soon as they wake up in the morning. [SEP] This trend has been consistent over the past few years and underscores the importance of having a strong mobile presence for our business.","4101":"Our productivity software segment continues to be a driving force behind our revenue growth. [SEP] I mean I think, that's right, last time we talked about the 60 million monthly active users for Office 365 and that continues to grow. [SEP] We've also seen strong adoption rates for our Teams collaboration platform among enterprise customers.","4102":"We have been seeing tremendous growth in our cloud services, particularly in Azure, which has been driving our revenue growth. [SEP] because the Azure hybrid benefits that exist with Windows Server and SQL Server are really valuable to customers if they want to move to Azure on their own terms, is the single best value proposition to a customer to make a commitment there. [SEP] In addition to the Azure hybrid benefits, our recent investments in security and compliance capabilities have also been a key factor in driving customer adoption of Azure.","4103":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our advertising platform and ensure that it is as valuable as possible for our advertisers. We invest heavily in research and development to keep up with the latest trends and deliver the best possible user experience. [SEP] And I think overall benefits not only the advertisers, but also the people who use Facebook. [SEP] We also believe that our advertising platform can be a force for good in the world. By helping businesses of all sizes reach new audiences and grow their customer base, we are supporting economic growth and job creation. And by making it easy for people to discover new products and services that align with their interests, we are enhancing their lives and helping them make more informed purchasing decisions.","4104":"We've seen tremendous growth in our ecosystem over the past year, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. [SEP] And so the way that I think about those products are they're products within the ecosystem itself. [SEP] By integrating these products seamlessly into the larger ecosystem, we're creating a more user-friendly and comprehensive experience for our customers. This, in turn, drives usage and adoption, which ultimately translates into higher revenues for our company.","4105":"Our iPhone sales have been a major driver of growth in recent quarters, and we expect this trend to continue. While the pandemic has presented some challenges, we've seen strong demand for our latest models, particularly the iPhone 12. [SEP] And you see in many cases, carriers and retailers having very vibrant programs around trading an iPhone in. [SEP] We've also been pleased with the success of our partnership with major carriers and retailers, who have created innovative programs to incentivize customers to upgrade their devices. It's clear that there's still a lot of room for growth in the smartphone market, and we're confident that our products and partnerships will help us continue to capture that growth in the years ahead.","4106":"In terms of Dynamics 365, we are seeing great momentum across all our cloud applications. [SEP] It\u2019s today available for enterprises and in the fall you will have the midmarket version of it, which I think is a another very big opportunity because it really helps take what we have learnt in the large enterprises and scale it to where perhaps the need is even more acute and so we are excited about that and at Inspire the partner channel obviously is very excited about it as well. [SEP] And so we expect that to be really one of our key areas of new growth here in FY18.","4107":"Our OpEx has been a topic of discussion for a while now, and I know it's an important factor for many of our investors. [SEP] The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new. [SEP] And I can confidently say that our approach has paid off, as we've seen strong growth and profitability in our core business areas.","4108":"Let's turn our attention to our international growth strategy. Can you update us on how our operations are performing in the Southeast Asia region? [SEP] I was really impressed last quarter with our progress in Vietnam and Indonesia and India among others. [SEP] Can you give us more specific numbers on the revenue growth in those markets? And what steps are we taking to further expand our presence in those countries?","4109":"Our goal is to provide the most seamless and convenient shopping experience for our customers. [SEP] You can build your cart using Alexa and then check out using the Prime Now app. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in the number of customers placing orders through voice assistants like Alexa and we will continue to invest in this technology.","4110":"We have seen consistent growth over the past quarter, and we attribute this to our strategic decisions and investments. [SEP] So continued \u2013 it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts. [SEP] Our focus moving forward will be to maintain this balance between efficiency and investment, in order to sustain our growth trajectory in the long term.","4111":"In Q4, we focused on launching new products and expanding our customer base. [SEP] We had great reception for the new iPhones that we launched at the end of September. [SEP] Additionally, we saw increased sales of accessories such as AirPods and Apple Watches, which contributed to our overall revenue growth.","4112":"We have made significant progress this quarter in increasing our customer base and improving our sales numbers. [SEP] So I feel good about all that, but we have a long way to go. [SEP] We are dedicated to continuing our growth trajectory and making strategic investments to increase operational efficiency.","4113":"One analyst asked about the geographic distribution of the company's manufacturing facilities. [SEP] Katy, if you look at the products that we have created and are manufacturing, they're really manufactured everywhere. [SEP] Could you speak to how this impacts your supply chain and distribution processes?","4114":"Our advertising revenue has increased by 25% this quarter, reaching a total of $16.6 billion. [SEP] We believe that because people are sharing interests, because people are themselves their real identity on the Facebook platform, we have a significant advantage just in basic targeting itself. [SEP] In addition, we are constantly improving our algorithms to better target and personalize ads for our users, leading to increased engagement and conversion rates.","4115":"Our main focus over the last quarter has been on increasing our sales and marketing efforts. We have identified a significant market opportunity that we believe we can capture with the right investment. [SEP] The sales and marketing investment, we\u2019re chasing a large opportunity here and that will be, you know as we say bumpy as we go along, but we are fully confident that that will be a very leveraged cost as we get to scale. [SEP] We have already seen some promising results from our increased sales and marketing efforts. Our customer acquisition numbers are on the rise, and we expect this trend to continue as we ramp up our investments further. While there will undoubtedly be some ups and downs along the way, we believe that we are on the right track to achieving our long-term goals.","4116":"Looking at our Q1 performance, we saw a decrease in sales compared to Q4. However, we anticipated this given the holiday season is over. [SEP] Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4 obviously, but a lot of the cost remain from the year-over-year build up in cost, particularly in the fulfillment network. [SEP] Moving forward, we are working on optimizing our fulfillment network to reduce costs and improve efficiency. We expect to see progress in this area over the coming quarters. Additionally, we are exploring pricing and promotional strategies to drive sales and mitigate the impact of Q1 volume drop-off.","4117":"We are also constantly improving the technology behind our data analytics capabilities. [SEP] And the sophistication of the data aid is growing exponentially, both in terms of the needs of the databases required, the processing that is required close to data. [SEP] This allows us to provide more tailored and meaningful insights to our clients, ultimately driving better business decisions.","4118":"We've had a lot of questions about our plans for expanding into this new market. [SEP] So just to kind of give a sense of the timeframe that we're thinking about this and how we expect this to develop, that's how we're thinking about that. [SEP] Of course, there are always unexpected challenges that arise when entering a new space, so we remain agile in our approach and ready to pivot if needed.","4119":"Now let's move on to our progress in our messaging platforms. [SEP] We are furthest ahead in Messenger, but it's still very early days. [SEP] We have exciting plans to continue investing in Messenger and other messaging platforms to better serve our users.","4120":"Can you provide us with some insight into your production planning process? [SEP] And typically we're looking at what the demand would be for peak as we figure out what we need [SEP] And how does that correlate with your inventory management strategy?","4121":"As we continue to expand our product offerings, we are seeing an influx of new customers who are eager to try out our latest technologies. [SEP] We're excited about all the customers in trial and are already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics, and ultimately voice. [SEP] Our team is constantly exploring new ways to enhance our services, and we believe that these innovative features will make our products even more valuable to both current and future customers.","4122":"I would like to take a moment to highlight our investment in fulfillment infrastructure. As you know, we have been working hard to improve our delivery times and optimize our supply chain. [SEP] If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off the similar increase in 2016. [SEP] This investment has paid off with a significant increase in the number of orders fulfilled and a reduction in shipping times. We plan to continue this trend in the coming year by expanding our fulfillment capabilities even further to meet the growing demands of our customers.","4123":"Our strategy for the future involves expanding our reach beyond our current customer base and venturing into new markets. [SEP] And we\u2019re really investing in new areas today where we see a long-term opportunity for revenue growth. [SEP] This may involve a shift in focus for some of our teams, but we believe it will ultimately lead to a more diversified revenue stream. Our goal is to position ourselves as a leader in emerging industries and capitalize on those opportunities early on.","4124":"We have been closely monitoring the latest manufacturing industry trends as we continue to improve our production process. [SEP] In a factory, one thing that is secular is that they're putting lots and lots of more sensors. [SEP] These sensors have allowed us to gather more data and optimize our operations, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity.","4125":"Our Q2 earnings are an important metric for us and we'll be discussing various aspects of our performance in this call. [SEP] So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2, with 27%, so we're comping against that. [SEP] However, we're confident in our ability to maintain strong growth momentum and have implemented several strategies to achieve this.","4126":"Now let's move on to discuss our performance in the current quarter. Despite some industry headwinds, we are pleased to report strong growth in our core business. [SEP] At 9% growth and continuing to take share, I feel like our performance in this continues to be a positive outlier to the peer group. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain focused on innovation and delivering value to our customers. We expect to maintain our competitive advantage and drive even stronger growth in the coming quarters.","4127":"Our latest earnings report shows a significant increase in iPhone sales in the U.S. during the past quarter. We attribute this growth to a strong demand for our latest iPhone models, particularly the iPhone X. [SEP] And so if you were to go out on just the U.S., since that tends to be more of the focus of this call, you look at the U.S. carriers, I think you would find you could buy an iPhone X for $33 a month. [SEP] This price includes a wireless plan with unlimited data, talk, and text. We believe this offer is a great value for consumers who are looking for an affordable way to purchase the latest iPhone. We will continue to innovate and provide our customers with the best iPhone experience possible.","4128":"We've seen some challenges in the market over the past quarter. [SEP] So, yeah, I would say essentially with that backdrop, we're still very, very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers on the consumer side. [SEP] We're continuing to invest in our marketing and distribution channels to capitalize on this momentum.","4129":"We have seen a significant shift towards cloud adoption in the past year, with more and more companies opting for hybrid and multi-cloud solutions. As a result, our Azure Active Directory has become an integral part of many organizations' IT infrastructure. [SEP] of all the enterprises use Active directory and all of them rendezvous with Azure Active Directory irrespective of what applications they have in whichever cloud because that becomes a very key control plane for IT. [SEP] We are constantly working to improve the integration between Active Directory and Azure Active Directory to make the transition to cloud even smoother for our customers. This has been reflected in our latest earnings, which showed exceptional growth in our cloud identity and access management solutions.","4130":"We are pleased to report that our earnings for the current quarter have exceeded expectations,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] Because of the performance in Xbox and in Surface, you're right, it is a hardware mix shift a bit. [SEP] However, we anticipate that with the release of our new software updates and the launch of our new hardware products, this mix shift will be temporary and we expect to see a more balanced growth in the long-term,\" added the Chief Financial Officer.","4131":"Our iPhone sales have been steadily growing quarter over quarter. [SEP] But since the launch of iPhone X, it has been the most popular iPhone every week, every week sales. [SEP] This trend is expected to continue with the upcoming release of the next generation iPhone.","4132":"Now, turning to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] The first one is the loss of leverage, because of the sequential decline in revenue. [SEP] The second issue is the increase in expenses due to our recent acquisition of a new subsidiary.","4133":"We've had a strong quarter, with revenues exceeding our expectations and solid growth in key markets. [SEP] And I think when you take those two things, along with what Satya said, being able to balance disciplined focus and execution for us, I think we feel very good about the progress we\u2019ve made. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy and believe we are well-positioned to continue delivering value to our customers and shareholders.","4134":"We have seen a steady increase in engagement on our platform over the past quarter. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe we can increase demand for Stories as we attract more advertisers and bring more effective direct response units to Stories. [SEP] Our team is focused on optimizing our ad targeting capabilities to ensure that we are delivering the right messages to the right audiences at the right time. We are confident that these efforts will drive further growth in our advertising revenue.","4135":"We've received a lot of questions from investors about our trade-in program and how it impacts our financials. [SEP] It does -- from a customer user point of view the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself. [SEP] However, from a financial standpoint, the trade-in program is accounted for as a reduction in revenue rather than a subsidy, which is important to keep in mind when analyzing our earnings.","4136":"Our earnings for this quarter have exceeded our previous projections, with a revenue growth of 15% year-over-year. We have seen significant growth in our cloud computing services, which now make up 40% of our total revenue. [SEP] You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate. [SEP] We are continuing to invest in expanding our data center capabilities to meet the increasing demand from our customers. In the next quarter, we expect to see further growth in our capital leases revenue as we bring online new data centers and optimize our existing ones. Overall, we are confident in our ability to sustain our growth and remain a leader in the industry.","4137":"Now turning to our financial performance over the past year. [SEP] There is no doubt that we had a unbelievable year last year and the Q2 was particularly really, really strong [SEP] However, as we move forward into Q3, we are facing some challenges in the market.","4138":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings conference call. [SEP] One thing that I would tell you is that we feel very good about the performance of the business right now. [SEP] We are committed to continuing to invest in our growth opportunities and deliver strong results for our shareholders.","4139":"We will now take questions from our investors and analysts. [SEP] And to your question on the per user services, specifically Enterprise Mobility, Keith, it was a bit better than I had anticipated in Q4. [SEP] Overall, our services segment saw significant growth and we are optimistic about its potential in the coming quarters.","4140":"Our strategy for this upcoming fiscal year is to focus on expanding our offerings and reach within the cloud computing market. Our goal is to provide our customers with a comprehensive suite of services that meet their needs. [SEP] Then we have a very common platform both for first party workloads as well as our third party business. [SEP] With this common platform, we can offer faster, more efficient services and solutions to our customers. We believe this will help us maintain our position as a leader in the industry and continue to grow our business.","4141":"We have seen significant growth in our user base over the past quarter. [SEP] So hopefully that's helpful but you are right, it is ARPU driven the performance outside of the 40% growth. [SEP] We are actively working on strategies to improve our ARPU and drive more revenue from our existing user base.","4142":"Can you provide more detail on the expense acceleration mentioned in the earnings report? [SEP] And then I would say the additional expense that leads to the acceleration is driven by three factors, not just one factor. [SEP] Could you explain what these three factors are and how they are impacting our expenses?","4143":"Can you give us an update on your growth targets for the next year? [SEP] We\u2019ll hit 20 soon and we\u2019re doubling that by mid-2016 as Angela has said earlier and Luca said in his prepared comments as well. [SEP] That's impressive growth. Can you walk us through the key drivers of this expansion?","4144":"We believe that the collaboration and communication market will continue to grow rapidly and we are very focused on this opportunity. Our Office and Skype platforms are uniquely positioned to address the needs of this market. [SEP] We clearly have some value to add there because of the uniqueness of Office and Skype and our services. [SEP] Additionally, we are investing in research and development to enhance these services and integrate new technologies such as artificial intelligence to improve user experience. We are confident that our focus on these areas will drive growth for our company in the years to come.","4145":"We're now shifting our focus to the subject of customer satisfaction. [SEP] And it applies to phones, it applies to Surface hardware, it applies to Hololens, and that's how I view it. [SEP] We're dedicated to creating products that our customers love and that work seamlessly and reliably with other technologies they use.","4146":"Looking ahead to the future of our company, we see immense potential in a few key areas. [SEP] These are generational opportunities that what's at play when it comes to the Intelligent Cloud or what's happening in augmented reality. [SEP] As we continue to invest in these areas, we expect to see significant growth and innovation in the years to come.","4147":"Can you provide any insight on how price increases may impact the company's earnings in the coming quarter? [SEP] So, it's not something -- it's something we've certainly seen in the past with timing of price increases, but it's built into the Q3 guidance that I've given. [SEP] Thank you for the clarification on that matter. Moving on to another topic, could you discuss any new product launches or initiatives that are coming up in the next few months?","4148":"We've received a lot of positive feedback from our customers about our new ad campaign. [SEP] Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. [SEP] We're looking forward to continuing to innovate and optimize our advertising strategy in the coming quarters.","4149":"We've noticed a significant shift towards digital transformation across all industries. [SEP] And that just speaks to, I think, what's happening in the economy, which is every company is becoming a digital company, and essentially what used to be COGS and operating expense is all going digital. [SEP] As a result, we are investing heavily in our own digital infrastructure to remain competitive.","4150":"We've implemented a new algorithm that prioritizes ad formats based on their performance and relevance. [SEP] So if somebody's willing to pay more for a video, it's going to get served before another type of format ad. [SEP] This has resulted in higher engagement rates and increased revenue for both our advertisers and our platform.","4151":"One of the questions we get asked a lot is about our AI capabilities. [SEP] SQL is an AI product because we have the one database that actually allows you to write Python and R in situ, store procedures right in your database. [SEP] This is something that sets us apart from other database providers in the market.","4152":"Our focus this quarter has been on improving our user engagement and providing more meaningful experiences for our community. [SEP] So in the Facebook app overall after helping people connect with friends and family, helping people connected with communities is the next most important social problem that we believe we can help address and that\u2019s just going to be an area of increasing value in the product. [SEP] We are also exploring new features and tools that will allow users to better connect with their local communities and find relevant events and activities.","4153":"As we look to the future of our advertising business, we see mobile as a key driver of growth. [SEP] And we're working hard to help advertisers develop the video creative that really works for mobile [SEP] In fact, our mobile video offerings have seen a 20% increase in engagement rates over the past quarter, indicating that we're on the right track.","4154":"Our team has been focused on identifying the most effective strategies for increasing revenue. [SEP] So we're currently working on making it so that that is the highest ROI thing. [SEP] We believe that by prioritizing this initiative, we can significantly improve our bottom line and drive sustained growth.","4155":"Now let's talk about our transition to the cloud. [SEP] And that's because first of all the move to the cloud combines a whole bunch of different categories as well as takes something that you mentioned, which is Linux. [SEP] So overall, the move to the cloud has been a game-changer for our company's technology infrastructure.","4156":"We are constantly exploring new ways to enhance our customers' experience on our platform. One of the initiatives we are currently working on is redesigning our app interface to make it more user-friendly and intuitive. [SEP] I think that's going to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers. [SEP] In addition, we are also using data analytics to personalize the advertisements that our customers receive, making the ad experience more relevant and engaging. These efforts have resulted in increased customer engagement and advertiser satisfaction, and we are excited to continue optimizing our platform for both parties.","4157":"During the past quarter, we have witnessed robust momentum across our various business segments. Despite the unprecedented business environment, we have delivered exceptional results, exceeding our expectations. Our cloud business, which constitutes one of the largest portions of our revenue stream, continued to witness strong growth. [SEP] But we're also seeing quite good growth in some of the Consumer businesses, which also are built on our cloud infrastructure, Search, some of our gaming assets, our Xbox Live business going forward. [SEP] Looking ahead, we maintain a positive outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Our investments in innovation, automation, and AI will continue to drive top-line growth and margins. We are also stepping up our efforts to expand our consumer businesses, with a particular focus on gaming and search. Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of the company.","4158":"Can you discuss how decision-making has evolved within the company over the past year? [SEP] It\u2019s a senior leadership team concept and the leadership environment that I think we're making collective decisions faster. [SEP] Overall, I believe this shift in leadership philosophy has contributed greatly to our recent successes and will continue to drive growth in the future.","4159":"Our Prime program remains a key driver of growth and customer loyalty. [SEP] We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter. [SEP] We are also excited to announce the launch of Alexa-powered shopping in France and Italy in the coming months.","4160":"We're now going to discuss our latest iPhone models, the XS and XS Max. [SEP] The XS and XS Max got off to a really great start and we've only been selling for a few weeks. [SEP] We've seen a high level of demand for the XS Max in particular, with many customers upgrading from previous iPhone models. We're confident that the XS and XS Max will continue to be strong performers in the coming months.","4161":"We have been tracking consumer behavior and market trends closely. [SEP] We are pretty careful and thoughtful about where we increase prices and when and by how much during mid-cycle [SEP] We want to ensure that our customers continue to see the value in our products and services.","4162":"Now, turning to our video advertising performance. [SEP] It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s not just large brand advertisers that are doing video but all of our market segments. [SEP] In fact, we've seen an increase in demand for video ads from small businesses and even individual content creators on our platform.","4163":"Moving on to our technology update for Q2, I'd like to address a few key developments in our cloud computing division. [SEP] On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption and machine learning services especially Amazon Sage Maker. [SEP] Our team has been hard at work developing new features and capabilities for Sage Maker, and we're excited to see how our customers are leveraging these tools to improve their businesses.","4164":"We've seen continued success with our Atlas platform and are excited to share some updates with you today. [SEP] And so our focus with Atlas is helping people really understand the results they get with ads. [SEP] We've also been investing in new machine learning technology to improve our targeting capabilities and drive even better results for our advertisers.","4165":"In response to a question about how a recent product launch had been performing. [SEP] So it's early, but you're right, we did see some incremental improvement over what we expected. [SEP] And we're optimistic that we can continue to build on that momentum moving forward.","4166":"We've been seeing a lot of interest from our customers in using our mobile app to research and purchase automobiles. [SEP] And I think they know that people are doing the research for autos and the purchases they make, which is a very long sales cycle on their mobile phone, and they want us to be part of that. [SEP] That's why we've been investing heavily in improving our mobile app's functionality and user experience, to make sure we're meeting our customers' needs and staying ahead of the competition.","4167":"We're very pleased with the recent acquisition of XYZ company. [SEP] So they definitely are margin accretive for us, but most importantly, they add a tremendous amount of value to the customers. [SEP] We've received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our customers since incorporating these products into our offering.","4168":"Our Q4 earnings results are in and I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our expectations. Our revenue for the quarter was up by 15% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] But I think in general, because our installed base was up strong double digit once again, there's a lot of factors that are very positive for us. [SEP] The growth in our installed base can be attributed to our successful marketing campaigns and partnerships with key industry players. Looking ahead, we are confident that we will continue to see strong performance in the coming quarters. Thank you all for your support and we look forward to updating you again soon.","4169":"Now let's move on to the factors that impacted our earnings this quarter. [SEP] I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth objectives.","4170":"We're really excited about the progress we've made in our advertising efforts. We believe we're providing a lot of value to our advertisers and users. [SEP] And one of the ways I talk to people about it is just ask what percentage of the ads do you see in your feed are as good as the very best posts you see from friends. [SEP] When we ask people this question, we generally get a very low percentage in response. That's why we're continuing to work on improving the quality of our ads and making them more relevant to individual users. We believe this will ultimately lead to greater success for our advertising partners and a better experience for our users.","4171":"Our analysis shows that our marketing campaigns are effectively converting customers from our competitors. [SEP] Bill, we continue to see a higher rate of switchers than we have seen in previous cycles [SEP] sentence: \"This validates our recent investments in improving our product offerings and customer service.","4172":"We are seeing some exciting developments in our technology division that I wanted to highlight. [SEP] Yes, I mean, one of the things that I talked about in my remarks this time was this power platform. [SEP] We believe this power platform has the potential to significantly enhance our product offerings and generate meaningful revenue growth in the years ahead.","4173":"As we continue to invest in the growth of our business, we remain committed to giving back to the communities we serve. [SEP] To share one example, a local e-commerce jewelry brand called Lokai started donating 10% of their net profits to charitable partners. [SEP] This not only aligns with our values as a company, but it has also resonated with our customers, leading to increased sales and brand loyalty. We are proud to support Lokai and other socially conscious businesses as we work towards building a better world.","4174":"We have been exploring various emerging markets to tap into potential growth opportunities. [SEP] But because the smartphones that are working there are low end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there. [SEP] However, we remain committed to investing in and expanding our presence in emerging markets, as we believe they will play a key role in our long-term growth strategy.","4175":"We understand how important it is to our users to have a clean and seamless experience on our platform. [SEP] So, we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. [SEP] We are constantly seeking feedback from our users and making adjustments to our advertising approach based on their preferences.","4176":"As we look to the future of our platform and content offerings... [SEP] I mean, there's always a richer way that people want to share and consume thoughts and ideas and I think that immersive 3D content is the obvious next thing after video. [SEP] This is why we are increasingly investing in 3D technology and partnering with creators to develop more immersive experiences for our users.","4177":"Moving on to our sales figures, I'm pleased to report that we have seen a steady increase in the percentage of third-party units within our paid units in the last quarter. [SEP] Third-party units are now up to 48% of paid units and that's up 400 basis points year-over-year, so that continues to be a factor in gross margin. [SEP] Despite the impact on gross margin, we remain committed to our strategy of collaborating with third-party sellers as it enables us to offer a wider variety of products to our customers. \n\nAdditional sentence: Furthermore, we have implemented measures to ensure that our third-party sellers comply with our strict quality and safety guidelines to maintain the integrity of our brand.","4178":"We're seeing great success with our expansion efforts overseas, particularly in Europe and Asia. [SEP] And of course we still have a lot of merchants left in the U.S. [SEP] We're confident that our continued growth in these regions, coupled with our already strong presence in the U.S., will result in sustained long-term revenue growth for the company.","4179":"Our company has been evaluating our long-term strategic goals and have identified an area that requires significant attention. We believe this will be a game changer for us and impact our growth trajectory for years to come. [SEP] For the time frame for this, I think that this is going to be a central focus for the company for the next five years or longer. [SEP] We have already begun the process of allocating resources and assembling a top-tier team to tackle this initiative. Our goal is to become a leader in this area and capture a sizable market share. We are excited for the opportunities and challenges ahead.","4180":"We have seen significant growth in our Office 365 subscriptions, with over 37 million active subscribers as of last quarter. [SEP] The other aspect of Office 365 which is important for us is the international element because we really never had very high penetration of our higher-end service SKUs in the international markets. [SEP] However, with the rollout of Office 365 in new international markets and the increasing demand for cloud-based productivity tools, we expect to see significant growth in the adoption of our higher-end service SKUs in these regions.","4181":"As we look at the future of our business, we are constantly evaluating our operations. [SEP] Even on the operations side, we are realizing that even if you keep your financials the same, there is need, and with increasing digitization, there is more operational modules that you need. [SEP] We are investing heavily in new technologies and identifying efficient processes to stay ahead of the competition.","4182":"We've seen a lot of positive momentum in our new business segment. [SEP] But at this point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast. [SEP] We believe that by the end of the year, we'll have a sizable presence in the majority of major metropolitan areas in the country.","4183":"Our team has been working hard to accelerate our growth in the marketplace. We are excited to share our progress with you today. [SEP] So we're not only bringing people who have traditionally worked with us, helping them replat to a completely new model but we're also bringing a lot of new ISVs into the fold as well and that's pretty exciting to see. [SEP] These new ISVs bring fresh ideas and perspectives to our platform, and we're already seeing the positive impact of their contributions. We look forward to continued growth and success as we expand our team and offerings.","4184":"We are now going to move on to discussing our company's performance and future outlook. [SEP] The layer about that for me is the data state, one of the exciting things is the growth in Azure DB, the growth in Cosmos DB, data warehouse product, the Datalake, so that is a place where we are seeing significant attach. [SEP] Overall, our data-driven products continue to show strong growth and adoption among our clients, which gives us a lot of confidence moving forward.","4185":"We have received a question from one of our investors asking about the drivers behind our recent quarterly growth. [SEP] Any growth acceleration or deceleration that you see can be very much tied to the total sales of the customer - that we have the customers in any country. [SEP] As a result, our strategy focuses on expanding our customer base in existing markets and exploring opportunities to enter new markets around the world.","4186":"We've been analyzing our business model and have decided to make some strategic changes. [SEP] So it's very important to us that we have the right business profile, both for Amazon and for the sellers. [SEP] That's why we're introducing new programs to help sellers improve their online presence and increase their sales.","4187":"Now, I would like to turn to our growth trajectory in international markets. [SEP] And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities in these markets and remain committed to expanding our reach globally.","4188":"We had a strong quarter overall, with revenue growth of 48% year-over-year. [SEP] But specific to core Facebook, I think those are some of the drivers that I'd call out. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are focused on continuing to innovate and improve the user experience on our platforms.","4189":"As we look ahead to the future of our company, there are several key initiatives that we believe will help drive growth and maximize value for our shareholders. [SEP] Another area where I'm really excited about this is our ability to keep the community safe, right? [SEP] We're investing heavily in new technology and partnerships to help us stay ahead of emerging threats and keep our users protected at all times.","4190":"One of the key metrics that has been a focus for us this quarter has been average revenue per user (ARPU). [SEP] This quarter and a little bit last I actually think some of the ARPU increase has been masked by some of the trends in seat growth. [SEP] However, as we continue to analyze the data, we're beginning to see a clearer picture of how ARPU is actually trending.","4191":"Can you speak to how the cloud has changed the way you develop and launch new products? [SEP] But one of the things that the cloud, to your point, makes fundamentally possible is the opportunity for us to quickly iterate the opportunity's billed value and deploy it more quickly to customers [SEP] How has this shift in approach impacted customer satisfaction and adoption?","4192":"One of the key drivers of our growth this quarter has been the continued success of our digital offerings. [SEP] So we're very happy with the linkage between our digital offerings in the Prime customer base. [SEP] As we look ahead to next quarter, we're eager to build off this momentum and continue to invest in our digital capabilities, ensuring our Prime customers have the best possible experience.","4193":"We've been exploring new ways to enhance the user experience on Facebook. [SEP] So we experiment with all these things in terms of some of them make sense to naturally have inside the Facebook app because you're using the same set of friends and network and connections. [SEP] However, there are other features and services that might be better suited outside of the core Facebook app, which is why we've also been developing standalone apps and platforms.","4194":"We are excited about the growth opportunities in the social media space and are exploring new ways to leverage our platform. [SEP] Once we start to get more of a critical mass, I think you can start to get social applications, which is what we as a company are more interested in over the long term and think have a huge amount of potential in addition to the video and gaming stuff, which I just think is going to be awesome in the next few years as well. [SEP] Our focus on social applications is part of our broader strategy to become a leader in the digital media industry and create value for our shareholders.","4195":"Now moving on to our health initiatives. [SEP] And in terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the health app, really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can easily go from doctor to doctor. [SEP] This aligns with our overall goal of empowering individuals to take control of their own health and wellness.","4196":"A question from Mark on the earnings call was regarding the profitability of Azure. [SEP] Just to add one thing that I\u2019d say is sort of -- to Mark\u2019s question, which is in particular on Azure, we have some commodity workloads but we also have many differentiated higher margin workloads especially in the Enterprise Mobility Suite is what I\u2019d call out is a good example of an infrastructure workload completely in the cloud that has got a very different margin structure. [SEP] Overall, we continue to see strong growth and profitability in our cloud services division, driven by a combination of these commodity and differentiated workloads.","4197":"Can you talk more about the competitive landscape within the advertising industry? How do you differentiate yourselves from other companies? [SEP] And so we think what we offer is the power of the broad reach of TV, but an ability to target much more efficiently. [SEP] Additionally, how do you see the future of TV advertising evolving in a world where more people are consuming content through streaming services? And how are you addressing the issue of ad fatigue among viewers?","4198":"We've been trying out some new initiatives to help us grow our business and stay ahead of the competition. [SEP] So, yeah, it's still early days and some of those experiments that we're doing, but we're seeing good traction on those things and we like that. [SEP] We're planning to continue investing in these experiments to see how they pan out in the long term and what kind of impact they could have on our bottom line.","4199":"We've had a lot of questions from investors about our plans for expanding production. [SEP] So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity add additional cost to Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we build the additional capacity. [SEP] However, we anticipate that this investment will result in significant long-term growth and profitability for the company.","4200":"We are seeing significant growth in our cloud business, driven by the acceleration of digital transformation across all industries. [SEP] In some sense, if you compare it to the TAM of STB versus what we now describe as intelligent cloud, we're operating in a much bigger market. [SEP] We have been investing heavily in our intelligent cloud platform, and we believe we are well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growing market.","4201":"Our revenue growth in the past quarter has been driven by our successful efforts to expand our client base and diversify our revenue streams. [SEP] We have an opportunity to turn those businesses into advertisers and marketers, and that's what we've done successfully and we're going to continue to focus on that. [SEP] By leveraging our data and analytics capabilities, we've been able to deliver highly targeted and effective advertising campaigns for our clients across a range of platforms and channels.","4202":"Another area of growth for our business has been through social media advertising, specifically on Facebook. [SEP] That said, we are pleased by what's happened on Facebook for the elections cycle, not just on the paid side but actually on the organic side as well. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to analyze this success and come up with new strategies for future social media campaigns.","4203":"We have been closely monitoring consumer behavior and have seen significant changes over the past year.\n- We believe that our approach to advertising is unique, and it allows us to provide significant value to both advertisers and consumers. [SEP] If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time. [SEP] Our ultimate goal is to create a seamless and personalized shopping experience for every Amazon customer.\n- We have already seen positive results from our advertising efforts, and we are excited to continue to innovate and improve in this area.","4204":"Now moving on to our product performance. [SEP] And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad. [SEP] We are very pleased with the strong adoption of our latest product offerings.","4205":"Now I want to give you an update on our staffing numbers. As you all know, we've been expanding rapidly over the past year, and we'd like to share some details with you today. [SEP] In general, I would say our head count growth has skewed towards the R&D side [SEP] Although we've also hired a fair number of sales and marketing professionals, we've made a deliberate push to invest in our research and development teams. We believe that this will pay dividends over the long term, as we develop new products and technologies that can keep us ahead of our competitors. So while we're always mindful of our overall headcount budget, we'll continue to focus on expanding our R&D capabilities in the coming quarters.","4206":"Our content offerings have continued to grow and diversify over the past year. [SEP] We've done some things like the Prime Original Series All or Nothing; the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. [SEP] In addition, we are excited about the upcoming release of several highly anticipated films and series, and we believe these will continue to drive engagement and growth across our platform.","4207":"Can you provide an update on how our different business segments are performing? [SEP] On the auto and insurance verticals, they're both still small which makes them good opportunities to grow. [SEP] We've seen some success in our efforts to expand into those verticals, but we recognize that it will take time to compete with established players in that space. Nonetheless, we feel confident that we can capture a significant share of the market over the long term.","4208":"Our Prime program has continued to be a significant driver of growth for the company. As we reported in our earnings release, the program saw a 30% increase in membership over the past year. [SEP] So we are very happy with the - not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. [SEP] We have also seen an increase in the number of Prime members who are taking advantage of our streaming video and music services, as well as our grocery delivery offerings. We believe that this sort of engagement is key to the continued success of the Prime program and the company as a whole.","4209":"Now, turning our attention to the financial results for the fourth quarter of the year. [SEP] Those two items impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by about 300 basis points. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we were still able to achieve a 6% overall growth rate for the fiscal year.","4210":"We saw significant growth in our cloud offerings last year, with an increase in adoption from both existing and new customers. [SEP] And so as you think about 2017, with the continued acceleration of our cloud mix and actually continued momentum in annuity, I would expect to see those same pressures continue to exist [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders.","4211":"We have seen some great success stories with our clients this quarter. [SEP] So to share one example, Motorola working with Ogilvy and Moto Mento (28:55) launched the Moto Z phone, and they did awareness boosting before they launched, targeting Android users and Verizon subscribers. [SEP] This campaign resulted in impressive pre-orders and a successful launch, exceeding our client's expectations. We are excited to see what other innovative campaigns our clients will come up with in the coming months.","4212":"We've seen a lot of growth in our technology department over the past few years. [SEP] It\u2019s really followed technological change, if you think back even four years, you can\u2019t really take a video, a lot of videos buffered on your phone. [SEP] Now, with advancements in 5G technology, our users can stream high-quality video content seamlessly on their mobile devices.","4213":"We have been closely monitoring our customers' needs and adjusting our strategy accordingly. [SEP] So it's those higher level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I think is accelerating and that's something that obviously we didn't make the decision last quarter to do that. [SEP] However, we are confident that these investments will position us for significant growth in the long term.","4214":"One area of growth that we are particularly excited about is our services division. [SEP] A perfect example would be an Apple Care agreement that you purchase at the time of the sale of the device. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in attach rates for our service offerings, demonstrating the value that customers place on these add-on options.","4215":"During the quarter, we continued to focus on expanding our customer base and increasing engagement with our existing clients. We believe that our unique value proposition and differentiated offerings position us well for long-term growth. [SEP] If you ask even our largest clients, our largest clients, if they drew a pie chart of where their consumer spend their time and money and whether they spend their time, we\u2019re still under-indexed. [SEP] That being said, we made significant progress in expanding our market share during the quarter. Our efforts to enhance our product offerings and improve customer experience are paying off, and we are seeing strong demand for our services.\n\nLooking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our business to drive growth and capture market share. We believe that our strategic priorities and disciplined execution will continue to yield positive results for our customers and shareholders.","4216":"Now let's turn our attention to our advertising strategy and recent updates. [SEP] So you've seen us work on dynamic ads, carousel ads, estimated store visits. [SEP] We're constantly exploring new ways to engage with consumers and drive sales, so you can expect to see more innovations in this area moving forward.","4217":"Our focus has always been on delivering the best possible services to our customers and in order to achieve that, we continue to invest heavily in the development of new technologies and services. [SEP] You can see us continue to invest in things like new application services, higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continuing to add functionality for data analytics, mobile, Internet of things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers. [SEP] With every passing day, we are working tirelessly to add new features and services that are designed to cater to the evolving needs of our customers and help them achieve their business objectives.","4218":"Can you provide some insight into the areas of the business that are driving growth? [SEP] But there is also F1, which is increasing the overall penetration and not to mention the small business segment, and of course all the markets that we participate in with Office 365 where we don't have much of a server business at all. [SEP] Do you anticipate any changes to your strategy to address this shift away from traditional server software?","4219":"Our Q3 results reflect the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations. [SEP] And we guided to 38.5% to 39.5%, which is slightly down versus our performance in Q2. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our ability to bounce back in Q4 and beyond as we adapt to the current landscape.","4220":"We take user safety very seriously, and we're constantly working towards making our platform a safe and trustworthy place for everyone. One area where we're focused on making improvements is in combating misinformation and harmful content. [SEP] The same goes for things around election interference and more proactively looking for inauthentic behavior. [SEP] We've made some progress, but we know there's still a lot of work to be done to ensure that bad actors aren't able to manipulate our platform. We're committed to investing in the technology and resources necessary to make this happen, and we're confident that with continued effort we can make real progress in these areas.","4221":"Our advertising revenue has continued to grow at a steady pace over the past quarter, as we have seen a surge in demand for our ad products,\" said the CEO.

[SEP] We are constantly working to enhance our advertising solutions and provide greater value to our advertisers,\" added the CFO. \"We are optimistic about the future growth potential of our advertising business.","4222":"Our team has been working diligently on the implementation of E5 over the past few months. We wanted to make sure that we were fully prepared for the shift in our operations. [SEP] And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5. [SEP] However, we anticipate that E5 will continue to drive growth for us over the coming quarters. Our analysis shows that the benefits of this implementation will be long-lasting and substantially improve our financial position.","4223":"We've been focused on optimizing our cost structure, and we're starting to see some significant improvements there. As we continue to scale our business, we expect to see additional benefits in terms of cost efficiencies. [SEP] Some of the fixed costs, frankly, even in COGS, tend to come down as a percentage over time. [SEP] Of course, there are also variable costs that we need to manage carefully. We've implemented a number of initiatives to improve our supply chain and reduce our cost of goods sold, and we're confident that these efforts will continue to pay off over the long term. Overall, we're very pleased with the progress we've made in optimizing our cost structure, and we believe that we're well positioned to continue driving growth and profitability in the years ahead.","4224":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our growth strategy. [SEP] As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last \u2013 fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. [SEP] Our focus this year is on international expansion, and we plan to open 30 new fulfillment centers in Europe and Asia.","4225":"One of our main objectives for this year is to improve our customer experience. [SEP] So we will try different delivery methods or pick-up points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now. [SEP] However, we have recently invested in our online ordering system to make it more user-friendly and efficient for our customers.","4226":"We're now going to move on to discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter. [SEP] Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. [SEP] We're confident that our focus on operational efficiency and improving customer experience will continue to drive growth for the company in the coming quarters.","4227":"We're constantly looking at new and innovative ways for people to share and engage with each other on our platforms. And video continues to be a key way that people communicate and express themselves. [SEP] We're seeing it with Instagram Stories and with Messenger and the initial test that we have with Messenger Day, where that is another interesting format for how you can put videos together. [SEP] We're also exploring ways to further integrate video into our products, particularly in our messaging apps. We believe video will continue to play an important role in how people connect and communicate, and we're excited to continue to explore new formats and ways to enhance the user experience.","4228":"Our team worked tirelessly to make this year's Prime Day the biggest and best yet,\" said the CEO. [SEP] Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015. [SEP] We are thrilled with the results and thank our loyal customers for their continued support,\" said the CFO. \"We are looking forward to building on this success for next year's Prime Day.","4229":"We had a strong quarter overall, with solid growth in many of our international markets and continued stability in our domestic business. [SEP] The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018. [SEP] Despite these factors, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results in the coming quarters and to capitalize on the many exciting opportunities that lie ahead.","4230":"We've been focused on expanding our presence in emerging markets over the past few years, and we've made some considerable strides in that area. [SEP] And what -- the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect and so that's what we think matters the most really. [SEP] Of course, emerging markets do come with their own set of challenges, but we believe that the potential for growth and profitability makes it a worthwhile endeavor for our company.","4231":"We've had some really exciting developments in our original programming. [SEP] The Man in the High Castle was actually our most-watched pilot, so we're excited about that one as well. [SEP] We're looking forward to bringing more great content to our viewers in the coming months.","4232":"Our company has been focused on providing high-quality services to our customers for many years. As we continue to grow and expand our reach, we are seeing some interesting trends in how our customers interact with us. [SEP] So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services over time tend spend more and more on our services. [SEP] This is a very encouraging sign for our business, as it suggests that our services are delivering real value to our customers. We are excited to continue developing new and innovative offerings that can help us build even stronger relationships with our customers over time. As we look ahead to the future, we remain committed to delivering excellent service and driving sustainable growth for our company.","4233":"Looking ahead, I want to talk about our strategy for Office 365 and Microsoft 365. [SEP] Our goal and I think the real opportunity that remains with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 going forward, is our ability to continue to grow the installed base, and to also continue to grow our ARPU. [SEP] To achieve this, we are investing heavily in product development, sales and marketing, and customer support to ensure our customers see the value in upgrading to our premium packages.","4234":"We have received a lot of feedback from our users regarding the need for more flexibility in using our services along with other platforms. [SEP] We\u2019re working on interoperability, that people will be able to choose to use between the services. [SEP] This is a significant step toward empowering our users and promoting a more open and collaborative digital ecosystem.","4235":"Now let me turn to our progress on expanding our fulfillment network. As we previously announced, we prioritized investments in capacity and infrastructure in the first half of the year to position us for the second half. [SEP] This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. [SEP] We remain on track to open a total of 30 net FCs in 2021, which will significantly improve our ability to serve customers even faster and more efficiently. I'm very pleased with the team's execution so far this year, and we're confident in our ability to continue expanding our network at a brisk pace going forward.","4236":"Thank you for the question. [SEP] To the question on the demand signals we're seeing in the U.S. in particular - I think, it is quite early, but as we said the U.S. has been a good market for us and a strong market for us for a good period of time, and it was again in Q2, as we noted. [SEP] We are closely monitoring the situation, but currently, our outlook for the U.S. market remains positive due to the strength of our business and product offerings. Additionally, we are also seeing strong demand signals in other regions, particularly in Asia and Europe. Overall, we are optimistic about the growth potential of our business and are committed to delivering value for our shareholders.","4237":"We are now moving on to discussing our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] Well, as I said, on revenue we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. [SEP] This growth in revenue was driven by strong sales of our new products as well as continued momentum in our services segment.","4238":"Our company has continued to experience solid growth throughout the year in both our products and services. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we see a lot of opportunities to further expand our business. [SEP] So there's a lot of moving parts within our headcount number, but there's a very strong investment going on in AWS devices and videos in particular. [SEP] Our investment in AWS devices and videos is a key component of our growth strategy, as we believe these areas have tremendous potential for continued success in the years to come. We're excited about the progress we've made so far, and we remain committed to delivering innovative, high-quality products and services to our customers.","4239":"We have a question from the analyst on the line regarding your relationship with your partners. [SEP] And of course, that means we have a trusted relationship, which is a competitive advantage in a world where some of our competitors have more complex business models, where in some cases they give them platforms, in other cases where they compete with them or tax them. [SEP] Can you give us some examples of how this trusted relationship has benefited the company in terms of revenue or market share?","4240":"We've seen a tremendous increase in demand for our software solutions, particularly within the realm of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management. Our Dynamics 365 platform has been a significant contributor to this growth. [SEP] And that's where I think we have an architectural advantage again with Dynamics 365. [SEP] We believe that our cloud-based approach and flexible deployment options place us at the forefront of the market. We will continue to invest in and enhance this platform to meet the changing needs of our customers and maintain our competitive edge.","4241":"During our recent customer feedback surveys, we discovered some interesting insights into the performance of our products. We're currently working on implementing some changes to address these concerns, but we wanted to take a moment to share our progress with all of you today.

[SEP] Our team has been hard at work to make necessary improvements that will improve the overall customer experience. We've already seen some promising results in our beta testing, and we can't wait to roll out these changes to our entire user base in the coming weeks. Thank you for your continued support and feedback as we strive to make our products the best they can be.","4242":"Thank you for your question. [SEP] And I think your interpretation that our focus on being a growth company, even at our scale, is certainly the right interpretation. [SEP] We have identified key areas for growth, such as expanding our product offerings and entering new markets.","4243":"Despite the challenges of the current economic climate, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. [SEP] We are continuing to invest meaningfully in digitizing those say MSMBs micro-small and medium-sized businesses. [SEP] Our investments in digitization have already shown promising results, with a 20% increase in online sales for our MSMB customers in the past quarter.","4244":"Our Messenger business has been seeing some impressive growth over the past quarter,\" the speaker began. \"But we do want to temper expectations moving forward. [SEP] But if there's one message here that I think is actually important to say, it's that we're trying to communicate that the pace of growing the Messenger business, it's a longer-term thing. [SEP] We don't want investors to think that this is going to happen overnight. It's going to take time to build up Messenger's capabilities and integrate it with our other products,\" the speaker continued. \"But we're confident that the growth we're seeing now is just the beginning of what's possible for this platform.","4245":"We've identified two key areas that we want to prioritize in the upcoming quarter. [SEP] Secondly, we're going to be focusing on growing engaging new experiences like Stories and promoting those. [SEP] We believe that by placing more emphasis on these experiences, we'll be able to drive user engagement and increase our overall user base.","4246":"Our Office 365 subscriber base continues to grow at a healthy rate. We are excited to share our plans for the future of Office 365. [SEP] And of course we're going to further expand that with new SKUs and new categories that are going to become part of Office 365. [SEP] We believe that these new additions will help us to remain competitive in the market. Our goal is to provide our subscribers with the tools they need to succeed in the modern workplace.","4247":"We've seen significant growth in this area over the past year. Our team has been working tirelessly to improve the product and expand its reach. [SEP] In terms of how it evolves, I think we're in the first inning on it. [SEP] We're optimistic about the future and believe we have a strong foundation to continue building upon. As we look ahead, we'll be closely monitoring user feedback and making adjustments as needed.","4248":"We're proud to say that our technology has played a key role in ensuring secure and fair elections around the world. In fact, we've received several commendations from various electoral bodies for the effectiveness of our systems. [SEP] And we've taken down a lot of effort by different nation states to harm or interfere in elections that way. [SEP] We will continue to invest in improving our technology and collaborating with governments to ensure that elections remain a cornerstone of democracy. We believe that our solutions will continue to be instrumental in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process in years to come.","4249":"During the quarter, we saw strong growth in our emerging markets division, particularly in India. We are excited about the potential for further expansion in this region. [SEP] But I view India as where China was maybe seven to ten years ago from that point of view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there. [SEP] We have already begun investing in the Indian market with the opening of several new retail locations and increased marketing efforts. Our team on the ground has been impressed with the enthusiasm and interest from local consumers. We believe that India will be a key driver of our future growth.","4250":"Now I would like to discuss our gross margin performance in the More Personal Computing segment. [SEP] Those were the exact same drivers in the gross margin change that we guided to in Q4, and I would expect stability as we've seen it in our More Personal Computing segment. [SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to closely monitor our gross margins and adapt our strategies accordingly to ensure profitability.","4251":"We have received a question from one of our investors regarding our strategy for acquiring customers. [SEP] There's a lot of competition for customers in the U.S. which I think is the market that you're talking about. [SEP] However, we have been able to differentiate ourselves by offering unique features and providing excellent customer support. Our growth in the U.S. market has been steady and we see a lot of potential for further expansion.","4252":"Can you speak to the level of consumer engagement you're seeing with your product?\"\n\nResponse: \"Sure. While we do have a loyal customer base, we understand that for most people, even when they start spending with us, we're a small portion of their budget.

[SEP] So how do you plan to increase your share of wallet among your customers?\"\n\nResponse: \"One way we're working on it is by improving our product offerings and expanding into new markets.

[SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new partnerships to expand our cloud infrastructure and improve the performance of our gaming platform.","4254":"We are pleased to report that our revenue for the quarter has increased compared to the same period last year. The growth was primarily driven by strong performance in our international markets. [SEP] So it was 56% on a reported basis but 51% on a constant currency basis, still a healthy growth rate. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in our key markets, and we remain committed to investing in our people and resources to drive sustained success. Thank you for your continued support.","4255":"One of our goals for this quarter was to deepen our understanding of our customers and their needs.

Our team has been working relentlessly to deliver innovative solutions that meet those needs and address the pain points of our clients. [SEP] We see many customers who would use even our PaaS services and even AWS. [SEP] However, we also recognize that our offerings may not be sufficient for all customers, particularly those with more complex technological requirements. As such, we remain committed to collaborating with other providers, such as AWS, to offer our customers the most comprehensive solutions available. We firmly believe that by working together, we can provide the best possible experience for our users, no matter their unique needs.","4259":"We are very excited to announce the launch of our new platform. This platform represents a significant evolution in our business and we believe it will help drive long-term growth for the company.

As expected, there have been some areas of strength and areas where we've seen some softer results. [SEP] In terms of the North American numbers, we're seeing slower growth in our more mature markets. [SEP] However, we've been experiencing strong growth in some of our emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. To address the slower growth in our mature markets, we are implementing targeted marketing campaigns and promotions to re-engage our customer base. Overall, we remain optimistic about our growth opportunities and are confident in our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives.","4264":"Moving on to partnerships and collaborations, I'm pleased to share some exciting news with all of you today.

[SEP] So, therefore, I think that the mix will be different by quarter-by-quarter, but increasingly our strategy is in many times to get our customers to get going with what is core storage or core compute, but then they scale into these higher levels of services. [SEP] Do you anticipate any challenges in executing this strategy?\" \n\nResponse: \"Yes, we've seen a growing demand for our higher levels of services, especially as customers become more comfortable with our core storage and compute offerings.

[SEP] This new model allows for seamless integration with other platforms and APIs, ultimately providing our clients with a much more unified and efficient workflow.","4271":"Let's move on to our partnerships and collaborations over the past quarter. [SEP] I guess I would point out in the quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. [SEP] These partnerships are a testament to the strength of our business and the value we bring to our clients.","4272":"We have been working diligently to simplify our product offerings and streamline our sales process. [SEP] What it does is really provide confidence to our committed customers buying on-prem servers that their transition to a hybrid, to cloud over a period of their agreement, is really about their choices, their timelines and their confidence. [SEP] This is just one example of how we are continuously focused on meeting the needs of our customers and driving growth for our business.","4273":"Our strategy for growth in the coming year is something we're very excited about, and it's one that we think will set us apart in the industry. [SEP] Overall, Karl, the focus for us is in what I describe as this hyperscale-plus-hybrid approach when you think about the current approach, which is pretty unique to us. [SEP] We believe that this approach will allow us to be more flexible and to more effectively meet the needs of our customers, both in terms of their current needs and in terms of how those needs may evolve over time.","4274":"Now, moving on to our subscription services. [SEP] Just on the first piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue to see that we're seeing sign-ups from memberships at a strong clip. [SEP] Additionally, we have noticed that our existing Prime members are increasing their usage of the service, with more frequent purchases and engagement with Prime Video and Music.","4275":"Our research and development team has been focused on creating cutting-edge solutions that can address the evolving needs of our customers. [SEP] So I feel very, very good about ultimately having innovation that drives both the consumption of more higher level services and then also making sure that we are available in all parts of the world, where the demand is going to spread to, because we are in the very, very early innings of essentially this new cloud growth, and there's only going to be increasing demand as there's more digitization of every city, every factory, every hospital and so on. [SEP] As we continue to invest in our technology and expand our global reach, we are confident that we will be able to capture a significant share of the growing cloud computing market.","4276":"We have spent the past year investing heavily in our infrastructure and expanding our global reach. Our efforts have paid off with a record-breaking quarter and we are confident in our ability to continue this growth trajectory. [SEP] No, I would say, A, we're not expecting diminished returns in any of our businesses or growth rates nor are we restraining the business or constraining the business in any way with our capital. [SEP] We are also exploring new partnerships and technologies to further enhance our offerings and stay ahead of the competition. Our focus remains on delivering value to our customers and shareholders by investing strategically and maintaining a strong financial position.","4277":"Our company has been closely monitoring global economic trends and consumer behavior. [SEP] We clearly see first things happening in U.S. and quickly followed by geographies like Germany and the UK. [SEP] We anticipate similar trends to emerge in other European countries as well.","4278":"We received questions from investors regarding the future growth potential of our messaging apps. [SEP] On WhatsApp, I don't think there's a particular magical number with 1 billion users. [SEP] However, we do see continued growth opportunities for WhatsApp, particularly in emerging markets where internet penetration is increasing.","4279":"As we reflect on the past year, I want to highlight some of the key strategic initiatives we've undertaken to enhance our users' experiences. One of the biggest changes we implemented was a shift towards prioritizing meaningful social interactions over passive content consumption. [SEP] So we've made a lot of shift this year, which I've talked a lot about on a bunch of these calls, to encourage more meaningful social interactions instead. [SEP] While this has caused some short-term challenges in terms of user engagement metrics, we believe that this shift will ultimately drive greater long-term success for our platform. Our users are more engaged than ever before, and we're seeing exciting growth opportunities in key markets around the world.","4280":"Can you give us some color on which segments are driving the company's growth this quarter? [SEP] We're broad-based against all of our segments of marketers, so brand and direct response, SMBs and developers. [SEP] And how do you see these segments evolving in the next few quarters?\"\n\n\"We're broad-based against all our segments of marketers, so brand and direct response, SMBs and developers. In particular, we've seen strong growth among our SMB customers, who are increasingly turning to our platform as a cost-effective way to reach their target audiences. Looking ahead, we believe that this trend will continue as more and more small businesses embrace digital advertising as a key driver of growth.","4281":"We've been seeing very strong sales in our key markets over the past quarter,\" said the CEO during the earnings call. [SEP] So I think the out-of-stock issue is that -- may be getting press or tied more to the increased demand that we're seeing and also selective weather-related restocking issues. [SEP] However, we are actively working to address this issue and have implemented several measures to ensure that our products remain in stock for our customers,\" added the Chief Operating Officer.","4282":"Our sales team has been closely monitoring consumer behavior in the Asian market.

[SEP] One of those is through Apple TV and you're well familiar with that product. [SEP] We're excited to continue expanding our presence in the digital space and explore new opportunities for growth.","4284":"Our new product line has been met with great success and demand in the market. [SEP] I feel that we have a formula there that I would like to apply more broadly in terms of growing, just delivering innovation, growing our own economic return for it, stimulating demand, creating categories. [SEP] We have identified several other potential markets where this formula could be applied and are currently conducting market research to determine their viability.","4285":"Thank you for your question regarding our return to shareholders. It's something we take very seriously and are proud of our track record. [SEP] And when you look at our track record of what we\u2019ve done over the last several years, you\u2019ve seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow. [SEP] We've also been focused on investing back into the business to drive growth and create long-term value for our stakeholders. We believe this balanced approach has helped us continue to deliver strong returns year after year.","4286":"We've seen some fluctuations in our earnings and we wanted to address them. [SEP] So all those three dimensions, there will be variability quarter to quarter in terms of what's happening. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our long-term growth strategy.","4287":"We would now like to discuss our performance in the smartphone market. As many of you know, the smartphone industry has become increasingly competitive in recent years. [SEP] In terms of the iPhone itself, even though we sell quite a few phones across the course of a year, our market share globally is low compared to the \u2013 our sales are low compared to the full market of smartphones. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to stay competitive and continue to innovate in this space. Our upcoming product releases are highly anticipated and we believe they will have a positive impact on our sales. We remain committed to providing our customers with the best technology and user experience possible.","4288":"Our company has been successful in expanding our operations and investing in new technologies. As a result, we've been able to contribute positively to the U.S. economy. [SEP] We've created 2 million jobs in the U.S., and we're incredibly proud of that. [SEP] However, we understand that there are still challenges ahead, especially as we navigate the ongoing pandemic. We remain committed to doing everything we can to support our employees and communities, as we work towards a stronger future for all.","4289":"I'd like to provide some context on our revenue growth over the past few quarters. [SEP] If you look at recent quarters, it was about half of that growth rate on a year-over-year basis. [SEP] However, we are optimistic about our future growth potential and have implemented strategies to accelerate our revenue growth.","4290":"We continue to focus on improving our news platform and providing a better experience for our users. We believe that high quality news is essential for fostering informed and engaged communities. [SEP] So I think that that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news on Facebook and it's something that we've been working on for a while, and I'm very excited about it. [SEP] Our teams have been working closely with publishers to ensure that the content is trustworthy and relevant. We will be launching this feature in the coming months and are confident that it will be well received by our users.","4291":"Our marketing team has been working hard to improve our advertising strategies and make them more effective. [SEP] And if the ads can be well-targeted, we think we'll be able to see engagement, and we already see that. [SEP] We will continue to monitor engagement and make adjustments to our targeting as needed to ensure maximum impact.","4292":"We have received numerous inquiries on the success of our Windows 10 launch and we're happy to say that we have seen impressive growth in adoption rates over the past year. [SEP] But it starts with having a good product truth which Windows 10 does deliver on. [SEP] Additionally, our customer satisfaction surveys have shown a significant improvement since the release of Windows 10, confirming that we are on the right track.","4293":"Our team has been closely monitoring emerging trends in the market.\"\n- \"As we analyze the data, we've noticed a consistent pattern. [SEP] We\u2019re seeing more of it in Q2 and we'll see it through the remainder of the year. [SEP] We've already started implementing strategies to adapt to this trend.\"\n- \"Our goal is to not only navigate this shift, but to also identify potential opportunities within it.","4294":"We recognize that recent events have put a spotlight on our platform and our responsibility to our users. [SEP] And on all the content and safety and security issues, there's more to do here but I'm proud of the work that we've done to get in front of a lot more of these issues. [SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to invest in our content moderation and safety protocols to ensure the highest level of user trust and satisfaction.","4295":"We're very pleased to report strong quarterly results, with revenue up 15% year-over-year. [SEP] And so hopefully, that helps give a little context to the number as well as our overall ability to continue to grow the sort of hybrid cloud opportunity high teens. [SEP] We believe that our investment in new technology and partnerships will enable us to capture even more market share in the coming quarters.","4296":"Now let's turn to our advertising revenue for the quarter. [SEP] But most importantly, I would go back to the fact that we're getting better on the ad product side of being able to optimize our inventory for the advertisers in a way that will we think drive good pricing in the system for us and good outcomes for the advertisers. [SEP] We're constantly working to improve our ad product offerings and we believe this will continue to bolster our revenue growth in the months ahead.","4297":"Now turning to our segment performance. [SEP] In terms of CNB, that's the reference I made in my comments to the lower expiry base. [SEP] While we did see some downward pressure there, we continue to have a strong outlook for growth in that business.","4298":"We expect to see continued improvement in our financial performance going forward. [SEP] More of that comes in the second half of the year structurally as we complete some of the restructuring efforts and those costs come out of our operating expense run rate. [SEP] As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial targets for the year.","4299":"During the holiday quarter, we sold more iPhones than we've ever sold in a quarter before. We also set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac, and Apple Watch. [SEP] This year, the difference was further magnified, because we shipped iPhone X in November rather than the September quarter. [SEP] The response to iPhone X has been overwhelmingly positive, with both customers and critics praising its innovative design and advanced features. We're excited about the momentum we're seeing across all of our product categories, and we believe we're well positioned for continued growth in the coming months and years.","4300":"Our strategy for growth is to invest in our ecosystem and drive adoption of our platform. [SEP] We are funding some feed content to get the ecosystem going, but the focus is on rev share. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe that a strong rev share model will incentivize creators to produce high-quality content that will benefit all parties involved.","4301":"We've made significant strides in our cloud services division over the past year, particularly in our database offerings. [SEP] I mean, especially on the database side is one place where I would say from a year-over-year worth of progress, whether it's just Azure database by itself. [SEP] And we see continued growth potential in this area as more businesses make the shift to cloud-based infrastructure.","4302":"As we come to the end of our discussion on the financials, I would like to provide some guidance for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] So I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter. [SEP] However, we will continue to monitor the volatile market conditions and may adjust our guidance if necessary.","4303":"Our advertising strategy has continued to be a focus for us this quarter as we look to optimize revenue opportunities. [SEP] So in Q2, we rolled out Dynamic Ads that were specifically focused on the travel vertical, and I'll share one example. [SEP] This particular Dynamic Ad for a vacation rental company led to a 35% increase in bookings compared to their previous advertising efforts.","4304":"Our overall revenue growth for the quarter was 8%, which was driven by solid performance across all of our business segments. [SEP] So in the first half of the year, we have a tougher comp, if you will, versus some strong growth in the first-half of last year. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain optimistic for the remainder of the year and are confident in our ability to execute our growth strategy and deliver value to our shareholders.","4305":"We have seen a dramatic shift in the enterprise technology landscape over the past decade. [SEP] That said, the relational database itself remains still a very strong component, but not the only component anymore, in both on-premise and off-premise. [SEP] Our focus now is on providing a more comprehensive range of cloud-based services that can be customized to meet the unique needs of our customers.","4306":"Our growth strategy is focused on expanding into international markets. Specifically, we are looking to increase penetration in places like Asia and Europe. [SEP] And China doesn't possess the level of fiber that some other countries do, and so in order to get the great video performance, et cetera, raising that penetration is really great. [SEP] We have already made significant progress in Europe, but we see even greater potential for growth in Asia, particularly China. As we work to increase our penetration in China, we recognize that there are unique challenges to doing business in this market. However, we are confident that our efforts will pay off in the long run, as we continue to innovate and deliver high-quality video content to our customers around the world.","4307":"When asked about potential new competitors in the market. [SEP] I think there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform. [SEP] However, I believe it's important to differentiate between true game-changing technology and incremental improvements.","4308":"Our digital marketing strategy has been evolving over the past year and we have been focusing heavily on social media advertising. We have been experimenting with different platforms to determine which ones yield the best results. [SEP] Then, as we moved into more photos with Instagram, more videos, a video ad on Facebook or Instagram is a very different thing if they perform well. [SEP] We have found that video ads on Facebook and Instagram have been the most successful in terms of engagement and conversions. The ability to target specific audiences and track performance metrics has allowed us to optimize our ad spend and maximize ROI.","4309":"We've been focused on driving growth across all of our businesses, and we've made significant progress in that area. However, I want to be clear that we're not just focused on short-term results. [SEP] And so I tend to take that approach as opposed to solving for any one number. [SEP] Ultimately, our goal is to create long-term value for our shareholders, and that means taking a measured approach to strategic decision-making. By staying focused on our core strengths and identifying new opportunities for growth, I believe we can continue to build a strong and sustainable business for years to come.","4310":"Our team has been closely monitoring the performance of our video content platform, Watch. [SEP] So what we're seeing so far is that a bunch of the content that has come onto Watch is good and is working and people watch it. [SEP] However, there are some areas where we're not seeing as much traction and we're continuing to explore why that might be.","4311":"We've also observed changes in the types of clients we're working with. In particular, we're seeing a lot more small businesses reaching out to us for technology support and development. [SEP] From entertainment to gaming, I've seen what I would call more small business solutions. [SEP] This shift has been exciting for us because we're able to offer more personalized solutions to these companies and really see the impact of our work. We're looking forward to continuing to expand our offerings to meet the needs of this growing market.","4312":"We've seen strong demand from both consumer and enterprise customers for Windows 10. Our goal over the coming months is to continue to drive momentum and grow adoption of the platform. [SEP] But to your point, the fact that there is pull already is a very, very good indicator of, and a good sign, and it's even better than what we saw with Windows 7. [SEP] We believe that Windows 10 is a key driver of growth for our business, and we remain committed to investing in and improving the platform. Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us and our customers.","4313":"In terms of investment in cybersecurity, we've seen a lot of companies ramp up their spending in recent years. Our own company has also increased investment in this area. However, we expect that trend to continue even more strongly in the coming year. [SEP] But I do think that to some degree the last few years and next year are probably going to be the biggest growth in the investment in the security efforts that we'll see. [SEP] Our industry is facing increasingly sophisticated threats, and it's clear that businesses have to invest in security to stay ahead of the curve. Although it will require a significant investment, we believe it's essential for our company to prioritize cybersecurity in the coming years. We're confident that this investment will pay off in the long run, both in terms of protecting our customers and safeguarding our own business operations.","4314":"As we move into the fourth quarter, we remain focused on meeting customer demand and fulfilling orders in a timely manner. [SEP] So yeah, we looking forward to a great holiday and that includes working with our shipping partners both in the U.S. and globally. [SEP] Our team is working hard to optimize shipping processes and ensure that our customers receive their orders as quickly and efficiently as possible.","4315":"We've been receiving questions about our revenue recognition process for a certain aspect of our business, so I wanted to take a moment to address that.\n- As we've discussed previously, we have a diverse portfolio of businesses that each have unique revenue streams and recognition methods. [SEP] So it's a bit different mechanism than you think about having in our standard EA, where it goes to the balance sheet and gets earned off. [SEP] In this case, we're utilizing a revenue sharing model that requires a slightly different approach.\n- Rest assured, this approach has been thoroughly reviewed by our accounting team and is in compliance with all relevant regulations.","4316":"Our company's net sales have increased by 28% compared to last year's numbers. [SEP] If you look at Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day. [SEP] We experienced a significant surge in the number of people who signed up for our Prime membership program during this event.","4317":"We've been seeing some incredible growth in our cloud-based services over the last quarter, and a lot of this has been driven by the success of our Azure platform. [SEP] And then one linchpin that we have between, in fact, our SaaS services, as well as Azure is Azure active trajectory. [SEP] With the addition of new features and improved integration with our other products, we believe that Azure active trajectory will continue to be a key driver of growth for our company going forward.","4318":"When looking at our international business, we're pleased to report solid results for the quarter. [SEP] The trend we saw there, as I said, we're 5% up in a constant currency basis. [SEP] This growth can be attributed to strong sales in our European and Asian markets, offsetting challenges in Latin America. We will continue to analyze and invest in these regions to drive sustained growth.","4319":"Now moving on to our segment revenue breakdown for the quarter. [SEP] So a bit of it was mix, but I would say this retail, which has a lower gross margin more because of the revenue treatment was stronger in Q4. [SEP] In contrast, our online sales experienced a slight dip in gross margin due to increased promotional activity during the holiday season.","4320":"In terms of externalities, we had a couple of big ones this quarter that we wanted to call out. The first was in Office 365 where we saw a significant increase in transactional purchases, driven in large part by the pandemic and the shift to remote work. [SEP] So if you think about that being the next major transactional type purchase that was driven a year ago as the first externality, the second was in Windows [DL] [ph] we also saw non-annuity purchases in Windows DL which again is in our commercial licensing segment. [SEP] Overall, we're seeing strong growth in our commercial licensing segment, driven by both annuity and non-annuity purchases. And we're optimistic about the future as we continue to invest in new products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","4321":"In terms of our sales performance, we saw a significant jump in revenue during Q2 compared to Q1. [SEP] If you recall, we were heavily supply constrained throughout the whole of Q1 and so some of that demand moved into Q2. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate a strong demand for our products throughout the rest of the year and are working hard to ramp up production to meet this demand.","4322":"I'd like to address our thoughts on the upcoming elections. [SEP] On the elections and political activity and political advertising, we're excited about the elections [SEP] We believe there will be a significant increase in political advertising spending during this time, and we're optimistic about the potential revenue opportunities for our company.","4323":"Can you provide an update on the growth of AmazonFresh? [SEP] But we've been running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers. [SEP] Can you give us an idea of your plans to expand AmazonFresh into new markets?","4324":"We've continued to see strong growth in our market share over the past quarter, driven largely by our success in the B2B sector. Our team's relentless focus on meeting the needs of our corporate customers has enabled us to expand our reach significantly in this area. [SEP] We think that what we know, that if you look at the Fortune 500 as an example, we\u2019re in essentially all of the Fortune 500 companies. [SEP] Moving forward, we remain committed to pursuing strategic partnerships and investments that will allow us to maintain our position as a leader in the market. We believe that our extensive network and diverse range of services make us the ideal partner for businesses seeking to streamline and optimize their operations.","4325":"Can you give us some insight into how your products are evolving? [SEP] I mean the way that we kind of see the products now is we\u2019ve helped people map out and wire up their networks over the last several years, and now in each of these apps we have opportunities to help people get more value from the networks that they\u2019ve created in some of that is going to be on the social side, especially around creating communities and groups and some of it is going to be more on the economic and opportunity side and there we\u2019re doing a whole lot of projects. [SEP] That's great to hear. Can you tell us more about the economic and opportunity projects you're working on?","4326":"Now I'd like to turn to our music streaming service, Apple Music. We had great momentum going into the quarter and I'm pleased to say that it continued to accelerate. [SEP] Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50% as I'd mentioned earlier during the quarter, and so some really, really strong results. [SEP] We're thrilled with the growth we're seeing in this area of our business and we're constantly looking for ways to improve and innovate within the music streaming industry. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance this past quarter and are excited for what's to come.","4327":"Our company has had a very successful quarter and I am pleased to report that we have seen significant growth in our revenue. [SEP] The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. [SEP] This impressive growth is a testament to the hard work of our team and our ongoing commitment to delivering innovative solutions to our customers.","4328":"The question I am frequently asked is whether our growth is reaching a saturation point. [SEP] And so I continue to believe, even though I\u2019ve seen people write that, that I think that theory is not correct, and do not see that. [SEP] Our data suggests that there is room for a lot more growth in our market.","4329":"Our sales and revenue have been impacted by various factors in the past quarter. However, we have successfully managed to offset some of the negative effects. [SEP] I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4. [SEP] Despite the anticipated headwind in Q4, we are confident in our ability to maintain our profitability and meet our financial targets for the year. We are exploring new opportunities and strategies to further enhance our business performance and provide value to our stakeholders.","4330":"Can you talk a bit about how the shift to video content consumption has impacted advertising revenue?. [SEP] And then yes, I do think that there are less impressions when people are consuming video, so that also is a factor as more time is spent on videos. [SEP] However, we are seeing stronger engagement rates and higher click-through rates on our video ads, which is promising for our ad revenue growth in the future.","4331":"Looking back at Q1, there were a lot of positive indicators for our business. [SEP] But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments. [SEP] Overall, we're optimistic about the momentum we've built and the opportunities ahead as we enter the second half of the year.","4332":"Let's now move on to our user metrics. [SEP] One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year on all regions, and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters. [SEP] This is a strong indication that our product is resonating with users and that we are effectively executing on our growth strategy.","4333":"Our quarterly report showed impressive growth in revenue and strong performance in all of our business segments. [SEP] And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. [SEP] We expect these new services to drive even more growth and bring added value to our customers.","4334":"We've seen some strong growth in the past few quarters and are excited about our performance. [SEP] But right now, we're going to remain focused on user experience and the experimentation we're doing. [SEP] Of course, we'll still be keeping an eye on our bottom line, but we believe that investing in a great user experience is ultimately the key to long-term success.","4335":"During this quarter, we saw significant growth in our cloud services division, particularly with Azure adoption. \n- Our team has been working diligently to improve our cost efficiency in both on-premise solutions and cloud offerings. [SEP] I think looking more pressured on gross margin just because the amount of Azure in the mix at the rate is growing, we\u2019re still not at that point where a $1 of gross margin in the cloud is equivalent to a $1 on-prem. [SEP] However, we recognize the increasing costs associated with cloud infrastructure and are continuing to evaluate our pricing strategy to ensure we are providing value to our customers while maintaining profitability. \n- As we further integrate Azure into our overall product portfolio, we expect to see continued growth in the cloud segment and improved margins over time.","4336":"Our revenue in the last quarter was down 10%. [SEP] Although when you\u2019re transitioning any business and all the hard work that we\u2019re doing here to prepare ourselves going forward, I do expect to see some volatility in that number. [SEP] However, I am confident that our investments in new product development and marketing will pay off in the long run.","4337":"Our Services business has been one of the key drivers of growth for our company in recent years. [SEP] The biggest element and the part of the Services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, is the App Store. [SEP] We\u2019re seeing an increasing number of developers choosing to distribute their apps exclusively through the App Store, which is contributing to its continued success.","4338":"During the conference call, an investor asked about the company's stance on a recent political issue. [SEP] She made a pledge when she was elected that she would explain every vote she takes, and she explains every vote she takes on Facebook. [SEP] This level of transparency has been positively received by her constituents and has earned her a reputation as a trustworthy representative.","4339":"We're really excited about this new feature we're rolling out on our platform. [SEP] So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side. [SEP] And we've seen a lot of positive feedback from both buyers and sellers since its launch.","4340":"Can you speak to what sets your company apart in terms of innovation? [SEP] Perhaps one of the most unique things about at least our portfolio and our innovation is that we think that it\u2019s the mobility of the individual not the one device. [SEP] This mindset allows us to create products and services that seamlessly fit into people's lives, whether they're on the go or stationary.","4341":"Our sales team has been working hard to boost iPad sales, and we have seen some positive results. However, there have been concerns about the slowdown of iPad sales in the last quarter, and we wanted to address those concerns today. [SEP] And so I'm not predicting the 90-day clips and so forth, but over long arc of time I really believe that iPad is a great space, a great product and with -- also coupled with the product innovation we\u2019ve got, I think there is a very, very bright future for it. [SEP] We are also exploring new markets and opportunities to expand the iPad's reach. Additionally, we are constantly improving the product with new features and designs in response to customer feedback. We are confident that the iPad will continue to be a top performer for our company in the years to come.","4342":"Our new product has been well received by customers and we expect it to contribute significantly to our revenue growth in the coming quarters. [SEP] We have a very good track record overtime to reduce those cost structures, but every time we introduce a new product that is a headwind at the beginning of the cycle for gross margin. [SEP] However, we are confident that our cost reduction efforts combined with the increasing sales of this new product will eventually lead to improved gross margins as we move further into the product cycle.","4343":"We have a number of exciting developments to share regarding our cloud-based services and products. [SEP] For example, in FinServ, some very Tier 1 trading applications now using some of our capabilities in service fabric, which is really a PaaS service, which allows you to manage microservices with low latency and high scale, that's a place where we are seeing in fact activity, whether it's game development or trading applications. [SEP] Our team is continuing to explore new use cases for service fabric, particularly in the healthcare and logistics sectors.","4344":"During the quarter, we continued to invest in innovative marketing strategies to attract and retain customers. [SEP] Just to share one example, American Express working with Digitas, rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older. [SEP] As a result of this campaign, we saw a 5% increase in travel-related spending on American Express cards among the targeted age group.","4345":"We've had an incredible year at Apple, with record-breaking sales across all of our product categories. Our team has worked tirelessly to innovate and bring new products to market. [SEP] And so I sort of back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered and I know I never go anywhere without the Watch and it's not because I'm the CEO of Apple. [SEP] But what really sets Apple apart, in my opinion, is our commitment to the user experience. We don't just create products, we create experiences that people love and can't live without. That's why I believe the Apple Watch has been such a success - it's not just a device, it's a part of people's lives. And that's something we're incredibly proud of.","4346":"Our focus on innovation and growth continues to pay off as we announce strong earnings for the quarter. \n- Despite the challenging economic environment, we were able to see significant progress across all segments of our business. [SEP] Whether it's investment in ourselves, and the returns you've seen in this quarter in revenue growth, whether it's the acquisitions like LinkedIn that are performing better than we expected. [SEP] We remain committed to investing in opportunities that will drive long-term value for our shareholders, and we believe that our current momentum is a testament to the effectiveness of that strategy. \n- Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic and believe that our strong financial position and robust portfolio of offerings will allow us to weather any future challenges that may arise.","4347":"We have seen a lot of interest and engagement from our PIV customers since we launched this program last quarter. We wanted to share some insights with you today. [SEP] On the engagement of the Prime customers, excuse me PIV customers, we have seen buying habits that look like normal Prime customers or other Prime customers from the group that comes in through the digital pipelines, but we do also see a higher pickup in retention rates and free trial conversions. [SEP] This is encouraging for us as we continue to invest in this program and explore additional ways to engage this customer group. We believe there is a lot of potential here and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.","4348":"We are pleased to report our quarterly earnings results. [SEP] There are a lot of elements in the gross margin line that we have good control over and there are also elements that we don't control. [SEP] However, we are actively working to mitigate the impact of those elements outside of our control and remain confident in our overall financial performance.","4349":"Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current economic climate and the growth prospects for our company. We're pleased with the progress we made in the previous quarter, but we're also aware that there are some challenges that lie ahead. [SEP] And then in addition, in Q4, and over the longer term, we do continue to expect to face ad targeting related headwinds and uncertainties. [SEP] However, we're taking a proactive approach towards addressing these issues and are confident that we can navigate the current landscape successfully. Our strategy for the near term is focused on optimizing our operations, improving our customer experience, and continuing to invest in innovation.\" \n\n\"We're also exploring new avenues for growth, such as expanding into new markets and experimenting with different revenue models. These efforts will take time to bear fruit, but we believe they are necessary to ensure our long-term success.","4350":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing, the environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis. [SEP] Overall, we saw a 5% increase in revenue driven by strong sales in our core markets. However, we did feel the impact of foreign exchange rates on our earnings.","4351":"Can you tell us more about your product pipeline? [SEP] We are launching some now and everything we launch new products, we make them better. [SEP] Our focus is always on improving the customer experience and providing innovative solutions.","4352":"We have been working towards creating a more stable and sustainable monetization model for our platforms. [SEP] In terms of payments, we really see payments as primarily a way to enforce the other activities we want to see on Facebook and Instagram. [SEP] This means that we will be investing heavily in the infrastructure required to support our payments services.","4353":"We are pleased to announce that our Prime membership has continued to grow at a steady pace. Our efforts to expand our Prime offerings have been a key driver in this growth. [SEP] And as a step back, it builds stronger Prime connectivity with our Prime members, at least, the higher membership renewal rates and higher overall engagement. [SEP] This renewed engagement with our Prime members has also allowed us to better understand their needs and preferences, which we will use to continually improve our offerings. Overall, we are confident that our Prime program will continue to be a strong driver of growth and loyalty.","4354":"As we look back on the past year's sales performance and assess the data, we have decided to make some important strategic changes moving forward. [SEP] And so, Keith, the way that I think about it and I tried to outline it in my comments is that the significant revenue declines quarter over quarter through the year are a reflection of the focused approach we're going to take in phone sales. [SEP] While we may see some short-term revenue declines as a result of these changes, we believe they will ultimately lead to long-term success and growth for our company.","4355":"We have seen a significant increase in engagement on our platform in the past quarter. [SEP] In terms of video content, newsfeed is as interesting as the quality of the content in it. [SEP] Our team is constantly working on identifying high-quality video content that our users will find engaging and informative.","4356":"The next question comes from John from Goldman Sachs. John, over to you. [SEP] There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and we have extremely low share in that market overall. [SEP] Yes, thank you. We have been actively exploring strategies to penetrate that market and have made some progress in recent months. We have a highly talented team working on this and are optimistic about our future growth in this area.","4357":"Moving on to our product segments, I would like to highlight our performance in the quarter. [SEP] Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than even the overall company number. [SEP] This growth was driven by strong sales of our latest product line, as well as successful expansions into new markets.","4358":"Now let's open the line for some questions from our analysts. [SEP] The question on Services, when we look at our Services business, it's obviously growing very well across the board. [SEP] Can you provide any specific metrics or insights into what's driving this growth in Services?","4359":"We have been focusing on enhancing the online shopping experience for our customers. It is important that we provide them with a seamless shopping experience, from browsing to buying. [SEP] If we can help people check out and pay for the products and even buy the products, it makes the consumer experience better. [SEP] We have also introduced new payment options and streamlined our checkout process to ensure that the purchasing process is smooth and hassle-free. Our goal is to provide our customers with a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience, and we believe that improving the checkout process is a crucial step in achieving this. Our research shows that most customers abandon their carts due to complicated checkout processes, so by simplifying this, we are helping to reduce cart abandonment rates and boost our sales.","4360":"Now, turning to our sales figures for the quarter. [SEP] And keep in mind that that's down 5% on a comp a year ago that was up 81%. [SEP] So, we're still pleased with the performance overall, especially considering the challenging market conditions.","4361":"We are excited to announce the launch of our new Facebook tab for curated content.

[SEP] This new feature will allow users to easily discover and engage with a variety of content from across the platform.","4362":"Our focus as a company remains on creating a connected and seamless experience across all devices. One way we're doing this is through the development and rollout of universal windows applications. [SEP] We're creating great opportunity for every developer to write these universal windows application that will run on the desktop as well as on our phone and tablets, as well as on Surface Hub and in fact Hollow Lands runs universal applications. [SEP] We believe that this approach not only benefits our customers but also provides a tremendous business opportunity for developers. By creating easy-to-use and flexible tools, we hope to drive innovation and growth across our ecosystem.","4363":"We have seen a lot of growth in our advertising business in recent years. In fact, advertising now makes up over half of our total revenue. [SEP] When you think about mobile app install ads, those are an important but relatively small part of our revenue. [SEP] However, there are other areas of advertising that we see as having much greater potential for growth. One of these areas is programmatic advertising, which we believe will become an increasingly important part of the industry in the years to come. We are also investing heavily in new technology to make our advertising products even more effective for our clients.","4364":"Our quarterly earnings report shows a slight decrease in overall profits, primarily due to increased competition in the e-commerce market. [SEP] Its offset by the growth in the Prime program itself and the expansion of Prime Benefits or the Prime program globally.

[SEP] But we believe these investments are necessary to support our growth and improve the customer experience.","4366":"We are excited to announce our new initiative to launch a high quality news section on our platform. [SEP] And surely even though not everyone comes to Facebook, because they want high quality news , I believe that there are going to be, whether it's 10% or 20% at a floor who I think would really want something like this. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to curate and publish content from reputable sources to ensure that our users have access to accurate and relevant news.","4367":"We've had a strong quarter for our services division, with several new partnerships and contracts. One trend that we've noticed is an increase in sales of bundled services packages that include both software and consulting services. This has had a positive impact on our gross margin for services. [SEP] Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because of the way we account for them. [SEP] However, we must also acknowledge that there are other factors at play, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, that can impact our margins. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver high-quality services that meet the needs of our customers while also driving profitable growth for our business.","4368":"Our cloud computing division has continued to perform exceptionally well this quarter.

We are pleased to share that we achieved strong revenue growth, driven by several key factors. [SEP] And so that's what that means, and that number is the largest that we've ever recorded since we began measuring it three or so years ago. [SEP] We attribute this growth to our continued investment in product development and marketing efforts. Moving forward, we remain optimistic about our potential for sustained growth and profitability.","4372":"CEO: \"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our margins which have been a focus for us over the past few quarters.\"\n\nCFO: \"Yes, we've been putting a lot of effort into improving our margins and I'm happy to report that we've made some significant progress. [SEP] So the margin improvement on a lot over a period of time is something that we are absolutely going to see, but from quarter to quarter there will be more volatility, but I would ask our investor base to think more about the architecture as well as the financial outlays of what we're building. [SEP] CEO: \"We're investing heavily in new technology and infrastructure that we believe will position us well for future growth. While this will impact our short-term margins, we believe it's the right long-term strategy for the company.\"\n\nCFO: \"To add to what the CEO said, it's important for our investors to understand that we're not just focused on short-term gains, we're building something that will be sustainable for years to come.","4373":"Our revenue growth this quarter has been driven by a combination of factors, including a strong demand for our products and services, increased market share, and strategic partnerships. Speaking of partnerships, I want to touch on one in particular that has been a crucial part of our success. [SEP] They're still, again, great partners, have been and will continue to be for the future, but we see opportunities where we need to add additional capacity and we're filling those voids. [SEP] We're grateful for our partners' contributions to our business, but as we expand into new markets and invest in new technologies, we need to ensure we have the resources and capacity to meet the growing demand. Our investments will enable us to not only meet immediate needs but also position us for sustained growth in the long term. We're excited about the future and confident in our ability to seize these opportunities.","4374":"Our cloud adoption rates continue to exceed our expectations and we are seeing significant growth in all of our cloud offerings. [SEP] That's probably the best manifestation of the virtuous cycle that we see in any of the cloud adoption that we have, right. [SEP] We believe that the virtuous cycle will continue to drive our cloud business forward and help us capture even more market share.","4375":"Now, moving on to our iPhone sales performance. [SEP] From an iPhone point of view, as I think Luca covered, our channel inventory decreased from the beginning of the quarter by 200,000 units, and that left us outside of our target range on the low -- outside the low end of the range to be specific. [SEP] However, we expect to make up for this shortfall in channel inventory in the next quarter and remain confident in the long-term growth potential of our iPhone business.","4376":"Our newest product, the XYZ app, has seen tremendous success in the market. [SEP] I'm using it every day and love it and I can\u2019t live without it. [SEP] We are confident that our continued investment in technological innovations like the XYZ app will drive sustained growth for our company in the long term.","4377":"We have been investing heavily in our supply chain infrastructure over the past year and a half. This has required significant financial resources, but we believe that it will ultimately create a more efficient and effective operation that can better meet the needs of our customers. [SEP] And so I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making. [SEP] Of course, this is just one aspect of our broader strategy. We are constantly looking for innovative ways to improve our operations and maintain a strong competitive position in the market. As always, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and customers alike.","4378":"We've seen tremendous growth in demand for our infrastructure server products over the past quarter. [SEP] And it turns out that the need for more computing, more storage and more infrastructure server products is much broader than just even the hyper scale public cloud because the one thing that is true is there are more devices in that unit backend. [SEP] As we move into the next quarter, we are confident that this trend will only continue as more and more companies look to upgrade their computing and storage capacities.","4379":"We're excited about the new product launch in Q4 and the potential it has for increasing revenue. [SEP] And that's going to be really important for continuing to grow this as well. [SEP] Additionally, we're exploring new partnerships and acquisition opportunities to expand our market reach.","4380":"Our company is committed to growth and expanding our customer base. We have identified several key areas where we believe we can increase our value proposition to customers and drive additional revenue streams.

[SEP] This will not only improve our visibility but also help us to showcase our products to a wider audience.","4382":"We did a deep dive into user behavior across our platforms. [SEP] And some of what we found is that as we encourage people to use both Facebook and Instagram, engagement on both can increase. [SEP] This has led us to invest further in cross-promoting content between the two apps.","4383":"I'd like to provide an update on the performance of our new tab feature. [SEP] I don't think we have any new status to share on this, but I mean overall we rolled out the tab for -- almost the first year we were really tuning it just to make sure that it would be retentive and very valuable for people. [SEP] We've seen a steady increase in user engagement and are confident in the value it's providing to our users.","4384":"Moving on to our digital services segment, I want to highlight some recent developments. [SEP] One of them, for example, is the fact that we are making it easier for customers to pay on the App Store. [SEP] We have also seen increased adoption of our subscription services, particularly in the entertainment and fitness categories.","4385":"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mark, for an update on our business performance and opportunities. [SEP] On the video ad opportunity, we're seeing consumer video exploding on our platform, as Mark has talked about, and that really creates the opportunity for video ads in the feed.

We are pleased to report strong growth in this area. [SEP] The strength of our Services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September.

We are confident that with this level of momentum we can continue to drive growth in this important part of our business.","4387":"Moving on to our entertainment division, we have some exciting updates on our content offerings. [SEP] On the content side, we've announced A-Team in the original TV series and we're customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. [SEP] Our streaming platform has also seen a significant increase in active users, with a 25% growth in the past quarter alone.","4388":"We've been closely monitoring changes in the advertising landscape and their impact on our clients' campaigns. [SEP] Obviously, if they are less able to target effectively, they'll get a lower ROI on their advertising campaigns. [SEP] That's why we're doubling down on our efforts to enhance our targeting capabilities and provide more data-driven insights to our clients.","4389":"Our e-commerce results have been very strong this quarter, with impressive growth in both sales and profits. As we continue to invest in our online channels, we're confident that we can maintain this momentum and drive long-term success.

But by staying focused on value optimization and leveraging our unique strengths, we believe we can stay ahead of the curve and continue to grow our online business for years to come.

It's not just about creating the next big product, but about understanding what our customers truly need. [SEP] And we really want to speak to the needs of the customers more than any product strategy goal we have. [SEP] That's why we've invested heavily in customer research and feedback loops. We're constantly listening to our customers' pain points and concerns, and using that information to inform our strategic decisions. At the end of the day, if we can't meet their needs and exceed their expectations, then we're not truly succeeding as a company.","4391":"During this quarter, we have seen some excellent performance from our sales team, who have been working tirelessly to acquire new customers and retain existing ones. As a result, we have achieved a significant increase in revenue, surpassing our own expectations.

[SEP] So, should we expect another significant increase in square footage for 2017?","4395":"We understand that there may be concerns about the impact of our recent pricing changes on our customers.

Our goal is to create a holistic commerce ecosystem within our platforms, benefitting both businesses and consumers.","4403":"We've seen continued growth and usage in our messaging platforms, with WhatsApp reaching over 2 billion users and Messenger seeing increased engagement during the pandemic. As we continue to invest in these platforms, our focus remains on privacy and security for our users. [SEP] And I think if there's an opportunity to use the work that we've done with WhatsApp there, rather than doing it in different ways in the different messaging experiences, to have that really just - to have encryption work in a consistent way across the different things that we're doing. [SEP] Additionally, we're exploring ways to integrate merchant services into our messaging platforms, allowing users to easily make purchases and transactions within the app. By maintaining strong encryption standards across all of our products, we can ensure that these transactions are secure and protected. We're excited about the potential of these developments and look forward to sharing more updates in the future.","4404":"Our revenue growth in Q1 has been strong, largely driven by increased demand for our products in the Chinese market.

[SEP] We've also seen positive results from our initial tests of the new privacy features, which give users more control over their data.","4407":"One of the challenges we faced during this quarter was the sudden increase in competition.

We are confident that our increased fulfillment capacity will allow us to continue providing top-notch service to our sellers and customers alike.","4415":"During the last quarter, we've seen a significant increase in video usage across all of our platforms. To capitalize on this trend, we've been investing heavily in our video capabilities and experimenting with new ways to make video creation and consumption even easier for our users. [SEP] And one of the big themes that we're talking about here is becoming video first, right, and as people look for richer and richer ways to express themselves just like people in the past just shared a lot of text and photos on Facebook, we think that in the future more of that is going to be video. [SEP] To support this shift towards video-first content, we're also exploring new advertising formats and partnerships that will allow us to better monetize video content. We believe that video will be a key driver of our long-term growth and remain committed to expanding our video capabilities even further in the years ahead.","4416":"We're pleased to report strong revenue growth for the quarter.

Overall, we're thrilled with our performance this quarter.","4418":"We are seeing some changes in our product mix, particularly on the higher-end models. [SEP] And also this channel inventory reduction that we've talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs.

[SEP] Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. [SEP] We attribute the success of our advertising revenue to our innovative advertising solutions and increased user engagement on our platform.","4468":"During the quarter, we've seen significant growth across our messaging and communication platforms. [SEP] One of the things that had been interesting, while we were watching these different services grow, was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services were growing at the same time, and it seemed a little bit counter-intuitive at first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it actually, now in retrospect looking back, seems like there is. [SEP] This has led us to explore new opportunities for integration and cross-promotion between these services, which we believe will further accelerate growth and engagement.","4469":"Our international expansion strategy is a key focus for us this year. [SEP] We talked about opening, announcing the region in India so there's expansion there as well. [SEP] Additionally, we have identified several other regions where we believe there is potential for significant growth.","4470":"Moving on to our Intelligent Cloud and intelligent edge infrastructure. This is an area that has continued to grow rapidly for us. [SEP] because at the scale at which we operate, the Intelligent Cloud and the intelligent edge infrastructure, which you all track as Azure, you got to remember it's the core platform that's powering everything from our gaming ambitions to what we are doing with Microsoft 365, to what we are doing with Dynamics 365 and of course, our third-party business in Azure. [SEP] And we're really just scratching the surface of what's possible with Azure. We believe the platform has even more potential to unlock game-changing innovations and drive growth across our entire business. So, we're really excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to continuing to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.","4471":"As we look to expand into new markets, we are closely monitoring the regulatory landscape in each country. [SEP] I think we\u2019ll see different paces of people doing things in different countries around the world, but a lot of what we hope that we can \u2013 that we can contribute to this discussion is as much as possible have shared frameworks for how the industry should operate around the world. During the call, the CEO was discussing the company's global expansion plans. [SEP] We believe that by establishing these shared frameworks, we can create consistency and efficiency in our operations across borders.","4472":"We have received inquiries from shareholders regarding our plans for returning value to them. [SEP] But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons we see a lot of value in the stock. [SEP] Therefore, at this time, we have decided to prioritize share buybacks over dividends.","4473":"We have seen a tremendous growth in our intelligent cloud business in the last quarter. [SEP] Heather, let me -- on gross margin, over a long-term period and intelligent cloud, given the expansive TAM and the growth opportunity we see, it will create gross margin pressure over long-term. [SEP] However, we believe that by investing in technology and innovation, we can offset this pressure and maintain a healthy gross margin over time.","4474":"Can you give us some insight into which verticals are driving the most revenue growth for your company? [SEP] You have our top verticals correct, and we see a lot of strong growth in those verticals. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our verticals and we plan to continue investing in those areas to ensure continued growth.","4475":"Our financial results for the quarter have been very encouraging, especially in the North American and International markets. We are pleased to report growth in both of these regions. [SEP] North America was up 200 basis points sequentially and International was up 800 basis points and half of that you remember we've spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was instituted last \u2013 April 1 of [SEP] Despite the challenges we faced with the Japanese consumption tax, we were able to successfully navigate the situation and deliver strong results. Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about our future prospects and are committed to continuing to deliver value to our shareholders.","4476":"Now turning to our emerging market segment. [SEP] And so very happy with the trajectory we're on there and excited to be investing and have the opportunities we do at that point. [SEP] Moving on to our North American operations...","4477":"We're really excited about the potential of our new technology. It's a game-changer for the industry and we believe it's going to take us to the next level. [SEP] So if you look at what the initial use cases are going to be around that, I think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people talking about. [SEP] We're working closely with our partners to identify the most promising use cases for the technology, and we're confident that we're on the right track. Ultimately, we believe that this new innovation is going to help us achieve a level of growth and success that we've never seen before.","4478":"Now moving on to our financial position... [SEP] And you know, of course we\u2019ve got a very, very strong balance sheet. [SEP] So we have the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and return capital to shareholders as we see fit.","4479":"During the quarter, we implemented several initiatives to improve engagement on our platform. [SEP] We thought that helping people interact more was the unique thing that people come to our services for and that it would be good for the community and the business over the long term. [SEP] As a result, we have seen an increase in user activity and higher levels of customer satisfaction.","4480":"We're always looking for ways to invest in the business to drive future growth. [SEP] So those are important investments from an ROI perspective, but they don't have, obviously, immediate translation into revenue dollars. [SEP] However, we firmly believe these investments will pay off in the long run as we continue to position ourselves for success in the market.","4481":"We have been investing heavily in our technology and platforms to make sure that we can provide tailored solutions that meet the needs of each individual customer. This has required us to be able to handle a lot of different types of data and to be able to respond quickly to changes in the market. [SEP] So I would say we are well equipped to deal with that complexity and the variability of what our customers want us to be helping them with. [SEP] Of course, there will always be challenges and new developments that we need to stay on top of. However, we have a highly skilled and knowledgeable team who are dedicated to finding the best solutions for our customers. We are confident that we can continue to adapt and thrive in this complex and ever-changing landscape.","4482":"Our revenue for this quarter has increased by 20% compared to the same quarter last year. We attribute this growth to our continued investment in research and development. [SEP] And then of course, there's some deeper AI research that we're doing that feeds into those applications as well. [SEP] We're excited to see the impact these advancements will have on our products and services, and we believe it will differentiate us from our competitors in the long run. We remain committed to investing in AI and leveraging its capabilities to improve the experience of our customers.","4483":"Moving on to our North America segment... [SEP] So sequentially last year, any North America EGM we dropped from 31% to 27%. [SEP] However, we saw growth in other regions, including a 2% increase in our European EGM and a 5% increase in our Asia Pacific EGM.","4484":"We have received a lot of questions on our ad loads and inventory. Our advertising team has been proactive in developing strategies to optimize ad loads and inventory. [SEP] While I can't get into some of the questions about ad loads and inventory, I would say really what we're focused on right now is driving relevancy, ensuring that we service the most useful ad as possible. [SEP] Our efforts to drive relevancy have led to positive feedback from our customers, and we have seen an increase in engagement with our served ads. As we continue to refine our ad strategy, we are also exploring new advertising formats to keep things fresh and engaging for our audience. We are confident that our focus on relevancy and customer satisfaction will lead to continued growth and success for our company.","4485":"The question I have is around the impact of currency on your business. [SEP] So we're within that period at this moment, and you can see for all of us that travel there so much, with every trip you can see this occurring. [SEP] How do you see this trend evolving over the next few quarters?","4486":"We have seen some changes in regulations regarding data privacy and usage that could potentially impact our business. [SEP] Any change of the ability for us and our advertisers to use data can impact our optimization potential at the margin, which could impact our ability to drive price improvements in the long run. [SEP] However, we are constantly monitoring these changes and adapting our strategies to ensure we can continue to deliver value to our advertisers and drive growth for our company.","4487":"Thank you for that question. [SEP] We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and services, not only to allow sellers to sell, but to help themselves more successfully. [SEP] It's really important for us to invest in our sellers and their success as it ultimately leads to more satisfied customers and a stronger business overall.","4488":"Question from an analyst: Can you talk about the impact that Instagram has had on your advertising revenue? We\u2019ve heard some advertisers express concern about rising costs and the effectiveness of the platform.\n\nResponse from the company executive: Of course. Instagram is a critical platform for us and we continue to see strong demand from advertisers. However, we understand that there may be some concerns about costs and ROI, particularly given the recent changes in user behavior and the competitive landscape. [SEP] On the Instagram question, certainly in the short-run, some of the spend is incremental and some of it isn\u2019t. [SEP] But overall, we feel very confident about the long-term prospects for advertising on Instagram. We\u2019re constantly iterating and refining our targeting capabilities to ensure that advertisers are seeing great results regardless of the size of their budget. And while we acknowledge that some of the spend may not be incremental in the short-term, we believe that as advertisers see the value of our platform and invest more in their campaigns, they will see strong ROI and continue to allocate more dollars towards Instagram.","4489":"We're also seeing a lot of growth in what we call our commercial cloud offerings, which includes Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. In fact, our commercial cloud revenue for the quarter was $13.3 billion, up 31% year over year. [SEP] Just because if you take something like Enterprise Mobility Suite, that gives you an indication of how, for example, we attach to Office 365 essentially an infrastructure service that has SaaS-like margins, or even some of our application services in Azure that attach to Office developer experiences. [SEP] And we're just scratching the surface of the potential for growth in these areas. Our focus on providing integrated, end-to-end solutions for our customers means that we can continue to drive adoption and revenue growth across our entire cloud portfolio. We're excited about the opportunities ahead and confident in our ability to capture them.","4490":"Our operations in China faced several challenges in the last quarter. While we continued to see strong demand and growth in the region, there were some headwinds that impacted our performance. [SEP] We have in China currently a set of geopolitical issues that we are working through. [SEP] We remain committed to the Chinese market and have a long-term strategy in place to navigate these challenges. We are closely monitoring the situation and will take appropriate actions to minimize any potential impact on our business. Our teams are working closely with local authorities and stakeholders to ensure that we comply with all regulatory requirements and maintain a strong presence in the region.","4491":"We are excited to announce our new partnership with XYZ Company. [SEP] And it gives us flexibility, we think the economics will make sense over time.

We believe this will allow us to further tap into the upgrader demographic and continue our growth trajectory.","4494":"We've had a strong quarter for iPhone sales, with continued growth in the smartphone market.

And we really think we've made some great strides in that area. [SEP] And then the other half is pull, right, and going to some experience where you're asking for some type of content and getting to a point where we can do that very well is just going to add a whole new dimension to the service. [SEP] And we've been seeing some really positive feedback from our users around the personalized content we've been able to offer them. So it's definitely an area that we're going to continue to invest in and focus on going forward.","4497":"Our focus over the past quarter has been on improving the user experience for our advertisers.

[SEP] We've seen promising results from Canvas ads and plan to continue investing in mobile ad offerings.","4498":"Now I would like to provide some insights into the performance of our services segment. [SEP] The first one is that of the services that we report, there's a portion, about 85% of all of the services that we report is directly tied to the installed base.

[SEP] This is thanks in large part to our continued focus on innovation and meeting the evolving needs of our customers.","4500":"We've seen great success with our new social media platform, but the challenge now is to keep up with the constantly evolving needs and wants of our users. [SEP] That means you need to have a platform that has a community around it and monetize as well. [SEP] Our strategy moving forward is to continue to focus on building and strengthening our community, while also introducing new revenue streams to ensure long-term growth and profitability.","4501":"Our latest marketing campaign was a huge success, as we saw a significant increase in brand awareness and customer engagement.

[SEP] Additionally, we plan to invest in targeted marketing campaigns to further increase adoption of these products and drive revenue growth.","4506":"One of the key areas we're focusing on is the integration of artificial intelligence into our products and services. [SEP] The canonical example for me is someone who collects data, does a prediction, ultimately then has to do something about that prediction, which means some automation like field service. [SEP] We're also working on developing user-friendly interfaces that allow non-technical personnel to easily utilize and benefit from these AI tools.","4507":"We've seen some really strong performance in our iPhone, iPad, and Mac products over the last quarter. Our team has been working hard to innovate and meet the changing needs of our consumers.

We remain committed to providing innovative and engaging content that keeps our Prime members coming back for more.","4516":"Our platform has always been designed to allow users to express themselves freely, without fear of censorship. However, we recognize the responsibility we have to prevent harmful content from spreading. [SEP] Today, that whole model is that people can post what they want and then a person can flag it, and then our systems will look at it. [SEP] To improve our system, we have been investing heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence technology. We believe this will allow us to better identify and remove harmful content, while still preserving the spirit of free expression that our platform was designed to promote.","4517":"We've seen some impressive growth in our advertising revenue over the past quarter. [SEP] But I think what is important here is we've been getting better and better at targeting as we optimize for real business results for advertisers, and we're better at converting the signals that we get from those advertisers into finding the right ad spots for them. [SEP] Our focus on enhancing our targeting capabilities has allowed us to improve overall advertising performance and drive higher ROI for our clients.","4518":"As we review our asset management strategy, we have identified an opportunity to increase the useful life of certain assets. [SEP] It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period and then new assets will be put into play will extend out for four years instead of three and we'll continue to revisit this. [SEP] We anticipate that this change will have a positive impact on our financial statements over the next several years.","4519":"We've seen an increase in demand for our mobile offerings over the past quarter, and we believe this trend will continue. [SEP] I think everybody's going to own a smartphone, and I think we've proven that we can compete for a fair number of those, as you can see from our results.

As you may know, we have been in a legal battle with Qualcomm over licensing fees for some time now. We believe that Qualcomm is charging us unfairly high royalty rates for their technology. [SEP] The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. [SEP] We strongly disagree with this approach and believe it is not only unfair to Apple but to the entire industry. It is also important to note that Qualcomm's licensing practices are under investigation by several antitrust agencies around the world. We are confident that we will prevail in this legal dispute and we will continue to fight for fair and reasonable licensing fees for our technology partners and ourselves.","4524":"Now, I'd like to turn our attention to some of the other products within our portfolio. [SEP] If you look at the other products category and look at the revenue in this category, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year over year change and assume that were the total Watch revenue [SEP] Just keep in mind that this category includes a variety of products, not just the Apple Watch, so it's important to look at the individual numbers to truly understand our performance.","4525":"During Prime Day, we offered our customers the best deals on our products, giving them an opportunity to upgrade their homes with some of the latest devices at an affordable price.

[SEP] So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party piece that's been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. [SEP] And so we've been able to adjust and adapt to that over time. It hasn't been a sudden influx of new states that we've had to scramble to accommodate. So overall, we feel confident in our ability to continue to navigate the changes in the regulatory environment and grow our business.","4540":"We have been focusing on expanding our data analytics capabilities.

As many of you know, these elements form the foundation of our business, and we remain committed to upholding them in all that we do. [SEP] If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think Jeff Bezos put it really well. [SEP] In the letter, Jeff highlighted the importance of embracing failure and maintaining a long-term perspective. These are two principles that we also hold dear at our company, and we're proud to be guided by them. Overall, we're excited to continue building on our momentum and delivering value to our shareholders in the coming quarters.","4543":"We've seen some great success in our recent partnership with XYZ company.

[SEP] We have a solid pipeline of products and are confident in our ability to drive growth in the coming months.","4551":"Based on our analysis of the current economic environment, we have been closely reviewing our purchasing decisions.

[SEP] We anticipate that these decisions will have a positive impact on our bottom line in the coming quarters.","4552":"We've had some questions from investors regarding how our unit sales have impacted our financial performance over the past few years. [SEP] If you look at our revenue, given the last three years, if you look at our net income during the last three years, if you look at our stock price here in the last three years, there's no correlation to the units sold in any given period. [SEP] We believe this is due to a variety of factors, including changes in pricing, fluctuations in demand from different markets, and investments we've made in new products and technologies. However, we are constantly working to find ways to improve our unit sales and maintain the strong financial position we've achieved.","4553":"Moving on to our e-commerce segment, let's talk about how our FBA services performed this quarter.

[SEP] We believe that these new computing technologies will create entirely new markets and be a major driving force behind the next wave of innovation in our industry.","4558":"Our sales figures have been strong this quarter, but we're always looking for more meaningful metrics to evaluate our performance.

However, we recognize that there is still room for improvement in this area.

Therefore, we have been focused on finding ways to increase ad revenue without compromising on the quality of our user experience. We remain committed to this strategy and will continue to seek out new opportunities for growth while keeping our users top of mind.","4560":"Our Prime subscriber base has continued to grow at a strong pace both domestically and internationally. We are seeing particularly strong growth in Europe and Japan. [SEP] As we may have mentioned in the past, we feel that Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally.

[SEP] So the biggest change that I think that we're going to see on the consumption in News Feed and in the tab over the next year or two is going to be much more video inventory and content coming in as we work through and make that business model start to really click for a lot of folks. [SEP] This shift towards video content will provide new opportunities for advertisers to reach their target audiences in more creative and engaging ways.","4565":"We've seen some changes in the market that have impacted our revenue streams. [SEP] But I think, in general, the goal is to have -- and continue to build on that business, but certainly, that would be where the \"volatility\" would show up. [SEP] We're hopeful that our strategies for diversification will mitigate any potential bumps in the road.","4566":"Our goal this quarter was to improve customer onboarding and retention. We recognized that many customers were experiencing difficulty navigating our platform and that this was negatively impacting their engagement with our product.

[SEP] In addition to advertising, we are also exploring partnerships and collaborations with other companies in the industry. We are confident that our investments in technology and talent will continue to drive growth in the years to come. Thank you for your time and attention.","4568":"During the earnings call, the CEO was asked about the impact of Office 365 on productivity within the company.

As we expand our business into new regions, we are excited about the potential for growth and the opportunities this presents. Our focus remains on providing exceptional service to our customers and driving sustainable, long-term growth. [SEP] The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself. [SEP] As we move forward, we will continue to monitor our performance closely and make adjustments as needed to ensure we are delivering value to our customers and generating strong returns for our shareholders. We remain committed to executing on our growth strategy and believe that we have the right team, products, and technology in place to continue delivering strong results.

[SEP] And so, the fact that we then -- we\u2019re often seeing extensions take place of prior commitments on Office 365 to again be longer and include the Azure contracts. [SEP] We're also seeing increased interest in our Teams platform, which has been a key factor in driving adoption of Office 365 and Azure.","4612":"We saw a significant increase in engagement and brand awareness in our latest campaign. [SEP] And I think that's because we have a combination of the creative and the story telling, so the art with the science of the targeting. [SEP] By leveraging our data analytics and user insights, we were able to effectively reach our target audience and drive conversions.","4613":"One analyst asked about any potential changes in revenue mix between OEM and accessories.

[SEP] So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers. [SEP] We are very excited about the potential of this offering, as we know that convenience is key for our customers.","4618":"As we navigate the current market conditions, we remain cautiously optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of the year.

[SEP] What happened is we realized that mobile was growing faster than desktop and that people were shifting their usage and that it was the more important thing for people\u2019s consumer experience.

[SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong growth in the upcoming quarters and exceed our annual revenue targets.","4624":"We have some concerns regarding our Q4 performance that we would like to address. [SEP] We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years, and this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently. [SEP] Despite these additional costs, our company remains dedicated to providing the best customer experience possible.","4625":"We've seen some really strong growth in both Europe and the United States. We've talked a little bit about the strong holiday results that we've had in the United States. [SEP] In Q4, we saw better growth in Europe because we've come off of the GDPR - the first two quarters of GDPR. [SEP] So, we're really happy with the progress that we've made in Europe.

We're seeing significant adoption of Azure across industries and geographies, and our customers are using the platform for a wide range of applications. [SEP] If you look at some of the most exciting things that are happening in the cloud, is cloud applications that actively require an edge Azure IOT, or Azure Stack are becoming the runtimes of the edge where you do need not only the ability to do compute and storage, but to run the AI inference and the edge. [SEP] This is a particularly important trend for industries like manufacturing and transportation, where real-time data processing is critical to operational efficiency.

[SEP] But we also have services that are very successful, that are below the average for the services business. [SEP] We're looking into ways to ramp up marketing efforts for these successful yet underperforming services.","4638":"We're pleased to report that we exceeded our Q3 earnings per share expectations by 10 cents. This was primarily driven by strong performance in our core business segments and continued cost optimization efforts. [SEP] As you've seen from our revenue guidance, and from cost savings, because as you know the commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. [SEP] However, we're closely monitoring the potential impact of tariffs and geopolitical tensions on our supply chain and overall business outlook. We'll continue to make strategic investments in innovation and technology to maintain our competitive edge in the market.","4639":"Our focus for the next quarter is to continue expanding our digital platform offerings.

[SEP] And so again, we'll continue to make acquisitions and we'll continue to do internal development, and so we're always looking, but in terms of a major acquisition, I don't see that in the future.","4642":"One of our key priorities is to ensure that we continue to innovate and develop products that meet the changing needs of our customers.

[SEP] If you think about the IaaS and PaaS numbers, I would expect to be on the higher end of growth rates. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in demand for both of these services and have made strategic investments to further support their growth.","4647":"Our company has seen a significant increase in usage of our social media application over the past quarter. [SEP] Now that may be possible because there's high, high, high engagement in Stories. [SEP] This engagement has also resulted in a higher rate of ad clicks and purchases within the platform.","4648":"Now we will take questions from the audience regarding our earnings report for the last quarter. [SEP] In terms of the North America revenue growth acceleration, one of the big factors there is really just also that's where you're picking up some of the accounting change from the Instant Articles going from net to gross, so that's contributing to that acceleration. [SEP] However, we also believe that our focus on offering high-quality user experiences and providing more personalized content to our users has also played a significant role in driving revenue growth in North America.","4649":"We are constantly striving to improve our Prime membership program in order to enhance the overall Amazon shopping experience. [SEP] It makes Prime stronger and then that's a self-reinforcing where Prime then \u2013 the Prime success attract mores sellers.

First, we're seeing improvements in our delivery times thanks to investments in our transportation network. [SEP] The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. [SEP] These sort centers allow us to aggregate parcels destined for specific areas, which not only reduces transportation costs but also helps us improve delivery speed. Additionally, we're utilizing machine learning algorithms to optimize routing and reduce the distance traveled by our vehicles.","4682":"Our goal as a company is to create innovative products that truly impact people's lives and change the world for the better. [SEP] The first is build an experience and get it to scale, to build a community that can get to hundreds of millions or 1 billion people or more. [SEP] Once we achieve that level of scale, the second priority is monetization through diverse revenue streams such as advertising, subscriptions, and partnerships.","4683":"Now turning to our revenue streams. [SEP] So we think that ads is a great business model that is aligned with our mission. [SEP] We will continue to explore new and innovative ways to utilize ads while also maintaining a high level of user experience.\" \n\nDuring the conference call, the company discussed its various sources of revenue and expounded on its belief that advertising is a sustainable and effective way to generate income. The team acknowledged that they recognize the importance of user experience and will strive to strike a balance between monetization and creating value for users. Overall, they remain optimistic about the potential for growth and success in the advertising sector.","4684":"Now turning to our Stories product, I want to take a moment to share some updates on our growth and engagement metrics. [SEP] So I'd say overall not a big change in the gap there and overall the impression growth is really the story for Stories and will remain the story we think for the near future. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our Stories product and improving the user experience. We're excited to see continued growth and engagement in this area and believe it will be a key driver of our business going forward.","4685":"Our goal this year is to strengthen our e-commerce platform and enhance the user experience. We want to ensure that our customers are satisfied with their purchases and have a seamless shopping experience. [SEP] We're working very hard to make sure that it's very easy for customers to buy the things they want to buy and access, a lot of the features they\u2019ve grown accustomed to on the website. [SEP] We're also investing in our mobile app to make it more user-friendly and efficient. Additionally, we're exploring new partnerships and expanding our product offerings to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of our customers. Our efforts are already yielding positive results, and we're confident that these initiatives will drive further growth and success for the company in the future.","4686":"When it comes to our advertising strategy, we're seeing a lot of success through social media platforms. [SEP] We believe both Facebook and Instagram have this combination of an ability to do great creative with the best targeting in a most sophisticated measurement which shows businesses how we help them move products off shelves. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a significant increase in sales since we began utilizing Facebook and Instagram for our advertising efforts.","4687":"As we look ahead to the next quarter, we're focused on continuing to expand our product offerings and reach new customers. [SEP] But overall, where -- a big focus for us is making sure that individuals and small businesses have access to the same kind of tools that historically only larger companies have had access to. [SEP] We believe this approach will help level the playing field and fuel growth for our company, as well as for the businesses and individuals we serve.","4688":"We've been seeing a lot of positive feedback from our subscribers regarding the content available through Amazon Prime [SEP] We love the \u2013 customers love the content and we like the results we see, particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime. [SEP] We're continually evaluating and enhancing the Prime experience to ensure it remains a valuable and reliable service for our customers.","4689":"Our marketing team has been exploring new ways to reach our target audience and increase brand awareness. [SEP] So to share an example, Garmin launched the Fenix 3 Sapphire watch, and they did it with videos ads on Facebook that worked without sound. [SEP] We are pleased to see that this approach has resonated with consumers and helped drive sales for this product.","4690":"As we continue to develop our technology and invest in research and development, we're constantly looking for ways to improve the user experience and provide innovative solutions to our customers. One area that we see a lot of potential for growth is in our smart home products. [SEP] When you have that, I think we're going get to a point where things like TVs, you no longer need a physical TV. [SEP] Instead, you'll be able to project the image onto any surface in your home using our new projection technology. We're also working on incorporating voice activation and artificial intelligence to make the user experience even more seamless and intuitive. We're excited about the possibilities and believe that this is just the beginning of a new era in home entertainment.","4691":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith with ABC Investment. John, you may begin your question. [SEP] And so I actually feel quite good with that outperformance and our ability to see that outperformance fall to the bottom line through stronger executional gross margin percentage, particularly in that segment. [SEP] John: Thank you. Can you provide more insight into the factors driving the outperformance in that segment?\nCEO: Sure. We have been able to increase our prices without seeing much pushback from customers, which has certainly helped the gross margin percentage. We have also been able to streamline our operations and improve our supply chain, which has led to better cost efficiencies. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made in that segment.","4692":"Our Q4 earnings report shows that we have generated record-breaking revenue, and we are pleased with the company's overall performance. We have also made strategic investments in the areas of voice, AI, and grocery delivery to enhance customer experience. [SEP] We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall. [SEP] While we anticipate further growth in the Prime program, we are aware of the challenges posed by competitors and changing consumer preferences. We will continue to innovate and offer value-added services to maintain our leadership position in the market. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our business.","4693":"Our company has seen significant growth in the Chinese market over the past year. [SEP] And so lots of positive things, and you know, as you probably heard me say before, I\u2019ve never seen as many people coming into the middle class as they are in China. [SEP] This trend towards a growing middle class in China is very encouraging for our business and we expect it to continue.","4694":"We recognize that there are significant trade tensions between countries, which have impacted our business and economic conditions. [SEP] And so I'm optimistic that the countries, the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe and so forth, can work these things out and work for the benefit of everyone. [SEP] It is important for all industries to continue to engage in constructive dialogue with governments to address these issues. We remain committed to navigating these challenges and growing our business globally.","4695":"We've had a really great quarter and have seen a lot of success with our cloud computing services. [SEP] But if you look at Boeing or you look at any of the other examples that I talk about when it comes to the cloud, our servers never did what these customers are now doing in our cloud. [SEP] We are excited to continue investing in this technology and improving our offerings for our customers.","4696":"We had a strong quarter, with revenue coming in slightly above our expectations. Our gross margin also improved compared to the same period last year. [SEP] And no specific categories we're calling out as a driver for gross margin because, again, we're much more focused on the profit dollars. [SEP] We are continuing to evaluate our pricing strategy and supply chain operations to find ways to optimize our profit margins. Our goal is to stay competitive in the market while also prioritizing profitability.","4697":"We've had some challenges in the supply chain recently. [SEP] And so we've spent quite a bit of time on that, as you might guess. [SEP] But we feel confident that with our new partnerships in place, we'll be able to mitigate those challenges moving forward.","4698":"In response to a question about customer satisfaction, the CEO emphasized the company's commitment to improving their services. [SEP] So there, the most important thing that we need to do is get the basics right and make sure that we are providing, hands down, without any question in anyone\u2019s mind, the clear best service in those areas. [SEP] We have a lot of work to do, but we are making progress,\" the CEO added. \"Our focus is on delivering exceptional value to our customers and building long-term relationships with them. We believe that by doing so, we will continue to grow and succeed in the long run.","4699":"Our team has been working hard to improve our infrastructure and we're seeing positive results. [SEP] So now as the technology on the network level improves to support that, what we're seeing is the ability to serve what is a large amount of demand for what's a very engaging type of content. [SEP] This content has been a major driver of revenue growth for us and we're excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible on our platform.","4700":"Our team has been working hard on improving our customer experience. [SEP] This has to do with wanting to provide customers a very simple way to upgrade. [SEP] We believe that by offering this streamlined process, we can increase our customer loyalty and satisfaction.","4701":"Now, turning to our revenue outlook for the next quarter [SEP] One of the things I would point out is that from a pricing perspective, there are headwinds that we might face on targeting, given the overall privacy landscape in 2019. [SEP] However, despite these challenges, we remain confident in the strength of our product offerings and our ability to navigate the market conditions.","4702":"Can you give us any updates on potential partnerships or acquisitions? [SEP] I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. [SEP] We're confident that with the products in our pipeline, we'll continue to see strong growth in the coming quarters.","4703":"Can you speak to how your company plans to compete in the hardware market? [SEP] But on the other hand, from our perspective, we're not a company that's traditionally done hardware or built operating systems or these kind of products. [SEP] So, while we are excited to expand our offerings, we are mindful of the challenges that come with entering new spaces.","4704":"We're really excited to share with you our latest earnings report, which highlights our continued growth and success in the marketplace. We attribute a lot of our success to our loyal customer base and the strength of our brand. [SEP] I think people love Apple products and we are going to do our best to serve the market. [SEP] Looking forward, we have some exciting new product launches coming up that we believe will further cement our position as a leader in the tech industry. We remain committed to innovation and excellence in everything we do, and we thank our shareholders for their continued support.","4705":"We've had a strong quarter with solid revenue growth driven by our advertising business. [SEP] And you can see in that example, even in your own feed, the opportunities we have to improve, finding the right ad and giving it to the right person at the right time, which drives businesses all around the world and drives our business as well. [SEP] Our focus remains on improving our ad targeting capabilities and delivering relevant and effective ads to our users while also ensuring a good user experience.","4706":"We are seeing a shift in our customers' preferences towards cloud-based solutions. Our sales team has reported an increase in inquiries about cloud services, and we are taking steps to meet this demand. [SEP] They are moving a significant number of them to the cloud, and in fact replatting to be even multitenant and cloud native. [SEP] This move to the cloud will not only allow our customers to scale their operations quickly, but also reduce their IT infrastructure costs and simplify their workflows. We are investing heavily in building robust cloud-native solutions that will help our customers stay competitive in today's fast-paced business environment.","4707":"Our iPhone sales have continued to show impressive growth worldwide. [SEP] But when we look at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, where for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. [SEP] Additionally, our expansion into emerging markets such as India has also contributed to the overall success of the iPhone.","4708":"Our Q3 results show an increase in revenue from our Windows PC and Surface device sales. [SEP] We've seen good demand inside commercial entities for and when they make those upgrades to buy Windows PCs and often Surface devices, in that choice, I think it's benefited our OEM partners and us. [SEP] We continue to focus on providing innovative products and solutions to meet the changing needs of commercial customers, and we believe this will drive further growth for our OEM partners and ourselves.","4709":"We are excited about the opportunities for growth in our international markets. We have seen strong performance in several key regions, particularly in Asia. [SEP] And there's also India, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. [SEP] We believe that India has tremendous potential and are committed to expanding our presence there. We have recently opened new offices and are hiring additional staff to support our operations in the region. We are confident that these investments will pay off in the long term and position us for success in this important market.","4710":"Our goal this quarter was to enhance our advertising capabilities and expand our reach to more users. We are excited to announce that we have made significant progress in achieving this objective. [SEP] So, for example, you can buy now in one interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network. [SEP] This integration has resulted in a significant increase in ad engagement and click-through rates, generating more revenue for our business. We are also exploring additional opportunities for integration with other social media platforms to further expand our reach.","4711":"Our Q2 financial results show impressive growth in both revenue and profit. However, we are aware that financial success is not the sole indicator of our company's progress. [SEP] We continue to work on the customer experience and making sure we're really delivering a quality experience for shoppers. [SEP] In light of this, we are investing heavily in new technologies to enhance the customer experience, such as personalized product recommendations and faster delivery times. We believe that these initiatives will strengthen our brand loyalty and ultimately drive sustainable growth in the long term.","4712":"So, I think we're really excited about the opportunity to bring new businesses and new customers into our ecosystem. [SEP] And it's \u2013 this is one of the things that I think will create a lot of value for people discovering and interacting with businesses. [SEP] And we believe that this will not only be beneficial for our customers and our partners, but it will also help us achieve our overall goal of making commerce more accessible and inclusive for everyone.","4713":"Our advertising revenue grew significantly this quarter, driven by strong demand from our advertising partners. We continue to invest in our ad platform to provide more value to our advertising customers. [SEP] I think broadly with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers, because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. [SEP] In addition to our strong relationships with advertisers, we are also focused on delivering a great user experience for shoppers. We believe that providing relevant and high-quality ad content is important for our users and will drive long-term success for our platform. We remain optimistic about the future of our advertising business and are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results.","4714":"One of the biggest challenges for our platform has been maintaining a safe and trustworthy environment for our users. [SEP] And since then, we've built the playbook out that has included building AI tools to identify thousands of fake accounts and groups and pages that violate the policies. [SEP] Our team continues to monitor and adapt to new tactics used by malicious actors to try and exploit our platform, and we remain committed to improving our tools and processes to combat these threats.","4715":"Can you comment on your capacity to take on new projects? [SEP] because if you look at our size versus the number of projects we have going, it's much smaller compared to most. [SEP] However, we are actively looking to expand our project portfolio in the near future.","4716":"Despite the challenges faced during the March quarter, we are pleased to report positive results. [SEP] So we feel very good about the gross margins that we\u2019ve generated in the March quarter, and we feel very good about the guidance that we provided, given the severity of the impact. [SEP] We remain confident in our ability to navigate through these uncertain times and deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders in the long term.","4717":"Our expansion into international markets has been a key growth strategy for our company. [SEP] It may be getting there a little slower than the starting point in the U.S. but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases. [SEP] We are optimistic about the potential for continued growth in these markets as we invest in local marketing and advertising efforts.","4718":"Now moving on to our iPhone sales performance. [SEP] I also look at the first time iPhone buyers and we're still seeing very, very large numbers in the countries that you would want to see those in, like China and Russia and Brazil and so forth. [SEP] This is a positive indicator for Apple's growth potential in emerging markets.","4719":"As we look to the future, our focus remains on continued growth and innovation. [SEP] So overwhelmingly, the thing that drives us are to embark on services that help that and become a part of the ecosystem. [SEP] We believe that by investing in services that complement and enhance our core offerings, we can better serve our customers and drive long-term success for our business.","4720":"As we continue to focus on improving our social media presence, we're happy to report some positive results. [SEP] It's also helpful on Instagram where we're also seeing the benefit of ranking changes. [SEP] Our marketing team is excited to explore ways to take advantage of these changes and increase engagement with our audience.","4721":"During the quarter, we have seen a number of exciting opportunities emerge that we believe can drive our future growth. [SEP] We mentioned simply one that didn\u2019t exist I think Brendan when we first started having this conversation, which was our EMS suite and I look and say, those opportunities as well as the creativity of our people I think gives me more confidence if not less in the structural integrity of the lifetime value of a customer argument. [SEP] Additionally, we are investing heavily in our research and development efforts to ensure we stay ahead of the curve in terms of technological innovation and customer service.","4722":"We've seen a significant shift in consumer behavior over the last year, as more people are spending time online. As a result, we've invested heavily in digital capabilities to better serve our customers. [SEP] Video is obviously super important so having the ability to do \u2013 work on video across the web has been really great. [SEP] Our team has been working on improving our video capabilities even further, with a focus on enhancing the user experience. We're excited to see the positive impact it will have on our business going forward.","4723":"We understand that data protection and user privacy are of utmost importance in today's digital world. As an organization, we have always placed high emphasis on these factors. In fact, we have made it a core part of our strategy and operations. [SEP] because we built our services around transparency and control, and we're building on this to ensure that we comply in May of next year. [SEP] We have already put in place a number of measures to prepare for the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) deadline. These include conducting thorough audits of our systems, processes, and policies, as well as providing training to our employees. We are confident that we will be fully compliant with all GDPR requirements well before the deadline.","4724":"As we discuss our revenue recognition policy, I'd like to note a change we made last year. Following the adoption of ASC 606, we've updated our revenue recognition policy for one of our major products. [SEP] Prior to 2018, we recognized this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. [SEP] Under the new policy, we now recognize revenue for this product at the time of delivery. As a result, you'll see a shift in revenue recognition across our quarters compared to prior years. However, we do expect this change to have a positive impact on our overall revenue growth for the year.","4725":"I wanted to touch on our progress with our Watch app. [SEP] So we got to there on Watch, it's growing well and that is -- so we're kind of still now focused on continuing to make it better and continuing to grow it.

[SEP] And what they did was just beautiful pictures but also targeting very specifically to women with specific interest, such as things like weddings and babies, and they saw a 6.4 times return on ad spend. [SEP] Based on this success, we plan to further invest in this type of targeted advertising going forward.","4728":"Thank you for that question, it's a great one. [SEP] As you mentioned in your second point, we've already launched an app accelerator center. [SEP] And I'm happy to report that it's been a huge success so far.","4729":"We have made significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year. [SEP] So that's the main thread of the AI work we're doing is trying to understand conversational and linguistic context and computer vision, photographic and video signals to understand what's going on there. [SEP] This has allowed us to improve our products and services, such as our chatbot and image recognition software, which has led to increased customer satisfaction.","4730":"We've been able to secure some really exciting partnerships recently [SEP] At this point, some of the partnerships we have with customers are of that same magnitude. [SEP] We're confident that these partnerships will continue to grow and drive significant revenue for us in the future.","4731":"Our sales team has been working hard to promote our products and services, and their efforts have resulted in some impressive growth numbers.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we're confident that we can build on this momentum and continue to see strong growth in the coming quarters.","4732":"We've received a lot of questions about Apple Pay, so I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about it. [SEP] And so for today, Apple Pay is very much about a great feature for our customers so that they can pay in a very simple, private, and secure way. [SEP] Looking ahead, we believe Apple Pay has tremendous potential to drive growth and further enhance the overall customer experience. We're working hard to expand Apple Pay's reach in new markets and increase the number of merchants who accept it. We're also exploring new use cases for Apple Pay, such as transit payments and peer-to-peer transactions. Overall, we're very excited about the future of Apple Pay and the role it will play in our ecosystem.","4733":"Our team has been focused on finding the most efficient and effective ways to acquire new users for our app. [SEP] When they were using a combination of Facebook, Instagram, and the Audience Network, they saw 57% lower cost per install with placement optimization and 59% more volume versus running on Facebook alone, which led to 6% incremental revenue. [SEP] We are excited to continue to test and optimize different advertising strategies to drive even more incremental revenue in the coming quarter.","4734":"We have a question from Jennifer on the line. [SEP] And so, Jennifer, listen, I kind of think about this as we\u2019ve a incredibly strong footprint inside existing enterprises today, that footprint and you can see it in our results. [SEP] However, we also recognize that there is opportunity for us to expand beyond our current footprint and we are actively exploring those options.","4735":"Our streaming service has seen a surge in subscribers, with many new members joining in the past quarter. [SEP] We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally. [SEP] We're confident that these new releases will continue to drive growth and engagement on our platform, and we look forward to their launch in the coming months.","4736":"Our team has been closely monitoring our key performance indicators and we're pleased to report that we continue to see positive trends in our growth trajectory. [SEP] And so I think, we remain confident that double-digit target that we have for that KPI and is it really, I don't think sort of a comparability challenge per se, but that\u2019s why we try to keep it at that high level to not get too tied to one or the other, given we know the TAM expansion that\u2019s possible, we know we can grow within it. [SEP] Additionally, we're constantly exploring new avenues to reach untapped markets and we believe that our continued focus on operational excellence and innovation will position us well for sustained success in the future.","4737":"We've heard a lot of buzz about the success of Amazon's Prime Video service, so can you give us some data on how it's doing? [SEP] Well, ultimately, I'll step back and say one of the main things we look out on Prime Video is customer usage patterns and in 2016 we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. [SEP] That's great to hear. Can you dive a little deeper into what's driving those usage patterns?","4738":"Now turning to our Services segment, which includes both product support and professional services. [SEP] So the gross margin rate of these services is clearly significantly dilutive to the overall Services margin. [SEP] However, we believe that expanding our services offerings is crucial for our long-term growth strategy and we expect to see strong revenue growth in this area in the coming years.","4739":"We've seen significant growth in our cloud services over the past quarter. [SEP] And I would add, in addition to the number of regions which Satya is talking about, it's also the capacity inside a region. [SEP] We're continuing to invest in expanding our data centers and increasing our capacity to meet the growing demand from our customers.","4740":"We've had a challenging quarter due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic on various markets. [SEP] And when Japan is better, it's why you also see the interesting relationship in constant currency. [SEP] Additionally, we're continuing to closely monitor the situation in other key regions to determine the potential impact on our performance for the rest of the year.","4741":"There has been a lot of concern and confusion about how GDPR will affect our business operations. [SEP] So on GDPR, I think fundamentally we believe we can continue to build a great ads business while protecting the privacy of the people who use Facebook. [SEP] We have implemented new privacy and data protection policies to comply with GDPR and are confident in our ability to meet the regulations while still providing a valuable user experience.","4742":"Our next question comes from John from Morgan Stanley. John, you may go ahead with your question. [SEP] I would just add that we did see that premium mix go up in Office 365 on the commercial side as you were noting. [SEP] John: Thanks for taking my question. Can you please provide more color on the premium mix increase? Was it across the board or was it concentrated in certain products?\nSpeaker: Sure, John. The premium mix increase was primarily driven by the adoption of our E5 plan and growth in usage of advanced features such as Power BI Pro and Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection. We also saw increased demand for our Dynamics 365 applications which have higher price points.","4743":"As we look ahead to the next quarter, we anticipate some positive developments in our business. [SEP] We are going to be getting some benefits from commodities in general and memory in particular. [SEP] This should help to mitigate some of the challenges we have been facing in other areas of our operations.","4744":"We are confident in our strategy to enter this new hardware segment.

We've also been keeping a close eye on our competitors' activities and adapting our strategies accordingly.

But we believe that we're well-positioned to weather any potential storms and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. Thank you for your questions and we appreciate your continued support.","4750":"We have seen some interesting trends in our physical stores that we would like to address. [SEP] Because of some of those, again, mostly the year-over-year accounting days, true up issue, it's showing up as negative 3% in physical stores. [SEP] However, we are encouraged by the growth we have seen in our online sales, which have increased by 15% year-over-year.","4751":"We have seen strong growth in our subscription revenue over the past quarter. [SEP] So when you look at that for the three months ended, around 34%, 35% for (04:05) and, historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is a big and leading contributor (04:12) signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that (04:18). [SEP] We are confident that our approach to unearned revenue will continue to drive success for our business in the future.","4752":"We have now entered the Q4 earnings season. [SEP] International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q3, if that was your point. [SEP] Could you elaborate on what is contributing to the slowdown in international growth?","4753":"Our second quarter results are in and we're happy to announce that we've exceeded expectations. [SEP] That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, so we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. [SEP] We're confident that with our current growth trajectory, we will continue to exceed expectations for the rest of the year.","4754":"Can you give us some guidance on how you see the yield curve evolving in the coming months?

[SEP] I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last \u2013 or, excuse me, in Q4.

[SEP] However, we are working closely with our legal team to come to a resolution as quickly as possible.","4763":"We've seen a shift in our product mix over the past quarter, with more sales coming from our lower-priced items. However, we've also seen an increase in overall revenue due to stronger demand for our premium products. [SEP] And so that leads why I always tend to say, I don't focus as much on the mix per se.

Of course, we'll continue to monitor trends and make adjustments as needed to stay competitive in the market.","4764":"We're now going to move on to discussing our capital expenditures. \n- I'd like to ask our CFO to provide some more information about our capital structure.

Additionally, we're investing in tools and resources to make it easier for our partners to sell our products and services.","4831":"We've seen tremendous growth and engagement with Live over the past year, and we're excited to continue to invest in this product. [SEP] In rolling out things like Live, we've had this infrastructure that we've been building out for a decade all around the world, and that allowed us to build a product like Live where someone has to stream something live from their phone to potentially hundreds of thousands of people around the world. [SEP] In addition to Live, we're exploring other ways to utilize our existing infrastructure to create new and innovative products that will further enhance the user experience on our platform.","4832":"We are seeing a significant increase in the adoption of our technology across the globe. [SEP] I think it's become \u2013 every year it becomes more important to people's lives and there are more things people are doing with it. [SEP] Our team is constantly working to improve the user experience and enhance the functionalities of our platform to keep up with the evolving needs of our customers.","4833":"One of the key advantages of our retail stores is the ability to provide customers with a hands-on experience. We believe that customers want to touch and try our devices before making a purchase. [SEP] So they get to touch and try our eReaders, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. [SEP] This \"try before you buy\" approach has been a key factor in driving sales and customer loyalty. In fact, we've seen a significant increase in sales conversion rates at our retail locations compared to online-only sales. We will continue to invest in the expansion of our retail footprint to provide this valuable experience to even more customers.","4834":"One of our top priorities is to enhance the customer experience and provide innovative solutions for our clients. [SEP] We're working on a lot of different things that make it so that people can get value from interacting with businesses. [SEP] Through our market research and customer feedback, we have identified key areas where we can improve and tailor our services to meet their needs.","4835":"Our cloud business continues to drive significant growth for the company. [SEP] That is servicing \u2013 accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. [SEP] We also see strong demand for our AI and ML services, which are growing faster than the overall cloud market.","4836":"Can you provide some insight into the fluctuation in revenue from one quarter to the next? [SEP] Quarter to quarter and year to year, we just have different amounts of contracts expiring. [SEP] However, we have a solid pipeline of new business opportunities that we expect will offset any potential impact from contract expirations in the coming quarters.","4837":"We were asked earlier about our relationship with Cognizant and I just wanted to clarify that they are one of our many partners. [SEP] But we have a wide variety of different partners beyond Cognizant who work with us. [SEP] In fact, we're always looking for opportunities to expand our partnerships and collaborate with new companies to bring innovative solutions to our clients.","4838":"Our company has been keeping a close eye on the trends in technology and communication. As we continue to strive for innovation and growth, we recognize the importance of staying ahead of the curve. [SEP] We know that messaging is going to be increasingly important, that\u2019s why we went out and hired David Marcus who is one of the best product leaders in the field to Messenger and why we bought WhatsApp, which the leading messaging product worldwide. [SEP] With the addition of Marcus and the acquisition of WhatsApp, we are confident in our ability to provide the best messaging services to our customers. We look forward to exploring new opportunities and expanding our reach in this rapidly evolving space.","4839":"We continue to provide a platform that encourages civic engagement and fostering a sense of community. Our efforts to improve the quality of discourse and reduce the spread of misinformation have been successful. [SEP] So between January 1 and October 7 of this year, over 68 million people on Facebook in the U.S. made over 1 billion interactions about the campaign alone, and every candidate and every member of Congress is on Facebook now. [SEP] We recognize the importance of our role in the political process, and we will continue to work to ensure that our platform is used ethically and responsibly. We remain committed to empowering individuals to express their opinions and connect with others who share their views.","4840":"We have been focusing our efforts on improving our cloud services, and we are excited about the progress we have made so far. [SEP] Those choices have been made, but at the same time, now they have a choice around database, and so we think that that's a very good incremental opportunity for us. [SEP] Additionally, we have also been investing in our AI capabilities, and we believe that this will further enhance the value we bring to our customers.","4841":"Our third quarter earnings were slightly lower than expected due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic and global economic uncertainty. [SEP] However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. [SEP] Despite these positive indicators, we remain cautious in our outlook for the next quarter as the pandemic continues to pose challenges for our industry.","4842":"We have really been focused on executing our long-term strategy over the past year. [SEP] And that strategy, I think, is bearing out and we'll continue to apply it to all of the things that we do. [SEP] Our team is committed to delivering value to our shareholders and customers through this approach.","4843":"We have been closely monitoring the economic situation in China over the past quarter. [SEP] I think that there's a misunderstanding probably particularly in the Western world about China's economy, which contributes to the confusion. [SEP] But I want to assure our investors that our company has a strong strategy in place to navigate any potential challenges in the Chinese market.","4844":"We have seen a lot of success in our efforts to integrate our various technologies and solutions. [SEP] So for example, one of the comments I made in my remarks was, for example, SharePoint with PowerApps and Flow. [SEP] This has led to increased productivity and efficiency for our clients, and we are excited about the potential for further innovation in this area.","4845":"Now, let's turn our attention to our investment strategy. [SEP] Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space, because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience differentiate our products. [SEP] In addition to R&D, we have also made strategic acquisitions that complement our product offerings.","4846":"One of the questions we often get asked is whether we believe we have pricing power. [SEP] And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that, but it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace. [SEP] We're constantly monitoring the market and adjusting our pricing strategy to ensure we remain competitive while also taking advantage of opportunities where we can.","4847":"Can you elaborate on some of the new markets you are targeting? [SEP] Then things like what we are doing to even go to non-knowledge worker audiences in retail or in manufacturing with some of the things that we're doing with staff scheduling for example. [SEP] Are there any other industries you are focusing on reaching with your services?","4848":"During the quarter, we experienced some headwinds due to the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic. [SEP] The guidance we gave and our annuity positions in terms of renewals and where we saw them were exactly, frankly, what we expected with the small exception of the geos that I called out [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenging times and continue delivering value to our shareholders. We are also exploring new growth opportunities in emerging markets and digital channels.","4849":"We've been closely monitoring the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and their potential impact on our business. Our team has been actively strategizing ways to mitigate any potential negative effects. [SEP] And so I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently. [SEP] Additionally, we are continuing to explore new markets and partnerships in order to further diversify our revenue streams and reduce our reliance on any one region or country.","4850":"Our App Store continues to be a primary driver of growth and revenue for our company. [SEP] We now have over 2 million apps in the App Store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there are so many out there. [SEP] We are constantly analyzing user data and seeking feedback from developers to improve App Store search algorithms and features.","4851":"We have been focused on building bridges between our apps to create a more cohesive experience for our users. We believe that this will not only improve user engagement, but also increase our ability to monetize our platforms. [SEP] We want to make it so that features that get built across Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp and when people engage on those, it can also make your experience better across the other apps in the family, too. [SEP] We have already started testing some of these features, such as cross-posting between Instagram Stories and Facebook Stories. We have also seen positive results from our recent integration of Messenger and Instagram Direct messaging. We will continue to invest in these cross-platform features in order to create more value for our users and advertisers.","4852":"When we look at user behavior on our platform, we've noticed some interesting trends. Specifically, we've seen differences in the types of content users prefer to share across different devices. [SEP] So on desktop, for example, it's easier to type, so we saw more text posts. [SEP] On the other hand, on mobile devices, we've noticed that users tend to share more visual content like photos and videos. This is likely because the small screen size makes it difficult to type long messages. As a result, we've updated our mobile app to make it more intuitive and user-friendly for sharing these types of content.","4853":"We're really excited about the evolution of our product roadmap and our ability to deliver new experiences to our users. The social aspect of the platform is something we believe will be particularly powerful. [SEP] So some parts of this will not land this year, but I expect a lot of this will start to land this year around this vision of building the private social platform. [SEP] Of course, there will be challenges along the way, but we're confident in our team's ability to overcome them. Ultimately, we believe that this private social platform will be a game-changer for our business, and we're excited to see it take shape in the coming months and years.","4854":"We have been working hard to streamline our production process and optimize our supply chain. We understand the importance of remaining cost-competitive in today's market. [SEP] We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures and over the life cycle of the product, we are able to bring them down. [SEP] This approach has helped us to remain profitable and drive growth for our shareholders. As we continue to refine our operations, we believe that we can maintain our cost advantage while delivering high-quality products to our customers.","4855":"Our commercial cloud has continued to experience strong growth over the past year. We are pleased to share that our revenue numbers have hit a new high. [SEP] When you think about, you are right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it, and for the year on a pure basis it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue. [SEP] Our team has worked tirelessly to expand our offerings and maintain our position as a leader in cloud computing. We look forward to continuing this growth trend in the upcoming year.","4856":"Our company's focus on providing high-quality goods at competitive prices has been a key driver of our success. [SEP] And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs. [SEP] Our research and development team has been hard at work to identify new opportunities to innovate and improve our product offerings.","4857":"We've received questions from investors and analysts about whether we plan to integrate these two acquired companies. [SEP] In terms of integrating them, no, we're not going to do that. [SEP] Instead, we plan to let them maintain their separate identities and work on synergies where it makes sense within our overall portfolio.","4858":"We have taken a closer look at the recent policy changes that have been implemented in the Indian market. [SEP] We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers. [SEP] Our team is currently exploring alternative options that will better serve the needs of our customers and partners in the region.","4859":"Our second quarter earnings were very strong, driven by the continued success of our App Store business. [SEP] The number of paying accounts continues to grow very strongly, and that's very, very important to us for the App Store business. [SEP] We are continually investing in our App Store to ensure that we provide the best possible experience for our customers and developers.","4860":"Now turning to our plans for the future. [SEP] The developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier, lots of interest there, lots of interest from the Watch App Store, to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the Mac. [SEP] We believe that these new tools will not only drive revenue growth for our company, but also enable our developers to create even more innovative and engaging experiences for our customers. \n\n\"The developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier, lots of interest there, lots of interest from the Watch App Store, to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port an iOS app to the Mac. Now turning to our plans for the future, we believe that these new tools will not only drive revenue growth for our company, but also enable our developers to create even more innovative and engaging experiences for our customers.","4861":"Our team has been working diligently to streamline our operations and optimize our resources. [SEP] If not the best, we are continually driving up efficiency and lowering costs and we see that in our bottom line. [SEP] We are confident that our focus on efficiency will continue to yield positive results for our company in the coming quarters.","4862":"So, let's talk a little bit about how our user metrics have been trending recently. [SEP] I think on the Facebook app, I just say the DAU trend paints the picture broadly for Facebook. [SEP] We've been seeing some really strong growth in our user base, particularly in emerging markets.","4863":"Can you provide some insight into how the recent market trends may impact the company's profitability in the coming quarters? [SEP] On the second half of your question, I tend to think you're right. [SEP] We are keeping a close eye on any potential headwinds and are actively working to mitigate any negative impact on our financial performance.","4864":"As we look at our financial performance over the past year, there is a trend of some fluctuations that we want to address with our shareholders and investors. [SEP] Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile. [SEP] However, when we look at the overall trajectory of our business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects and our ability to deliver value to our customers.","4865":"We've been working on a number of initiatives to optimize our cost structure and improve our margins. [SEP] So I would expect us to have the biggest change in our margin structure to happen in 2019 and for it to moderate from there. [SEP] Overall, we're optimistic about the outlook for our business and believe we're well positioned for long-term growth.","4866":"Can you provide an update on your strategy in India? [SEP] What I can say about India is when we see a positive surprise we double down on it. [SEP] We have seen some promising growth in our investment in the Indian market and plan to continue to allocate resources accordingly.","4867":"Can you talk about any changes or shifts in your spending strategy for sales and marketing? [SEP] But, yes, we are investing more in general in sales and marketing over time [SEP] We believe this investment will help us reach new audiences and drive growth in the long term.","4868":"We've been receiving questions about our pricing strategy for certain features, so we wanted to address that. First, let's talk about voice calling. [SEP] Yeah, and in terms of voice calling, no, we're not going to charge for it just like we're not going to charge for messaging. [SEP] We believe that offering free voice calling and messaging adds significant value to our platform and helps us attract and retain users. Instead, we plan to monetize through other means, such as advertising and premium features.","4869":"Our company has been closely monitoring changes in consumer behavior when it comes to sharing content. [SEP] Now one of the things that we see is that the way that we are sharing is always changing, and some of this is because of underlying technical transition. [SEP] However, we believe that these technical transitions ultimately create more opportunities for us to innovate and improve our services.","4870":"Now let's move on to a breakdown of our revenue growth for the quarter. [SEP] The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well. [SEP] Specifically, our subscription-based services and licensing agreements contributed to this increase in other revenue, showcasing the diversification of our business model.","4871":"As we look at our subscription numbers, we're really pleased with the continued growth we're seeing across our product lines. Office 365 in particular continues to be a strong performer for us. [SEP] And that's probably frankly been true a little bit longer than we talked about technically in terms of what goes off and what comes on given we've now got, as Satya said, 60 million users and more than that in terms of seats sold. [SEP] We're also excited about the potential for growth in our Teams platform as we continue to invest in new features and capabilities. Looking ahead to the next quarter, we anticipate strong demand for our cloud services and are confident in our ability to deliver for our customers.","4872":"Our one-day delivery service has been a game changer for our customers, and we're seeing strong demand for it. [SEP] So we do need to build out more one-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start. [SEP] In addition to expanding our one-day capacity, we're also investing in technology to optimize delivery routes and improve efficiency.","4873":"We've had a lot of changes over the past year in terms of our product offerings and our organizational structure. [SEP] So there's no \u2013 I don't think we ever are going to declare that we are done making changes. [SEP] Our goal is to continuously adapt and improve as we navigate this ever-evolving market.","4874":"We've identified some really impactful demographic groups that we want to focus on. [SEP] So we look that that and we ask the question of hey, if 100 million people are in those very meaningful groups today, can we get that to be 1 billion people over next several years? [SEP] And we believe that with the right strategy and execution, we can achieve that goal.","4875":"Now let's move on to our international expansion strategy. [SEP] On Brazil, just briefly, yeah we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. [SEP] We've seen strong initial sales in the electronics category in Brazil and we're excited about the potential for growth in this market.","4876":"Our cloud computing division has seen incredible growth over the past year and shows no signs of slowing down. [SEP] In fact as I said, a lot of the Azure use case, I think you referenced this, have been non-zero-sum [SEP] We see even more potential for growth as we continue to expand our offerings and tap into new markets.","4877":"Our research shows that video-sharing is an area that has tremendous growth potential. [SEP] And we're going to focus a lot more on helping people share videos of their moments in their lives. [SEP] We plan to invest in new technology to make the video-sharing experience easier and more seamless for our users.","4878":"Our customers have been consistently requesting faster delivery options. [SEP] So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program. [SEP] We anticipate that this evolution in our shipping program will drive increased customer loyalty and repeat business.","4879":"We had a strong quarter overall, with revenue increasing by 20% year-over-year. Our core business continues to perform well, driven by growth in subscription revenue. [SEP] And then just on your second question around advertising, if you look at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some. [SEP] However, we are still seeing growth in our advertising revenue, albeit at a slower pace. This is due in part to increased competition in the digital advertising space. Nonetheless, we remain confident in our ability to innovate and find new opportunities for growth.","4880":"We have seen strong demand for our products and services, particularly in our wearables category. [SEP] Having said that, I think we\u2019re in a good position and by sometime in late June, we currently anticipate being in a position that we could begin to sell the Apple Watch in additional countries. [SEP] We will continue to closely monitor the global situation and work with local authorities to ensure the safety of our customers and employees as we expand the availability of the Apple Watch.","4881":"Thank you for the question. [SEP] We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. [SEP] Our investments have been focused on expanding our product offerings, improving our infrastructure, and hiring top talent to support our growth. We firmly believe that these investments will pay off in the long-term and position us for success in the increasingly competitive market.","4882":"When looking at our cloud services, we've seen continued growth and adoption from our customers. [SEP] So that's another place where something like Cosmos DB which is very unique in capability in the marketplace is definitely another service that's got real traction. [SEP] We believe that offering these unique services and capabilities is what sets us apart from our competitors and will continue to drive our success in the market.","4883":"Can you provide some insight into the growth potential of this segment? [SEP] If you look ahead five years, it will have ten times that number in it. [SEP] We are confident that our strategic investments and product innovation will continue to drive this growth.","4884":"Our enterprise business has been a key focus for us this past quarter. We have been working to expand our sales team and increase our market share in this area. [SEP] So you know there\u2019s a lot of factors at play there on the enterprise business, but we are having great success and we\u2019re adding a lot of sales force or sales representatives, especially for the enterprise market. [SEP] We have also introduced new product offerings specifically tailored to meet the needs of enterprise customers. Additionally, we have invested in our customer support team to ensure that we are providing the highest level of service to these important clients.","4885":"During the call, there were questions about the company's financials related to acquisitions. [SEP] On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. [SEP] Our accounting team has reviewed the paperwork and determined that the accrual is necessary based on current accounting standards.","4886":"Our e-commerce division has seen tremendous growth over the past quarter, with a significant increase in online sales. We continue to focus on expanding our product offerings and delivering unparalleled convenience to our customers. [SEP] We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year. [SEP] In addition to the integration of Whole Foods, we're also excited to announce the expansion of our grocery delivery and pickup services in select markets. We believe this will further enhance the shopping experience for our customers and drive continued growth for our business.","4887":"I want to provide an update on our financial performance for the year so far. [SEP] In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track. [SEP] However, we are continuing to implement cost-saving measures and exploring new opportunities for revenue growth in order to mitigate this slowdown.","4888":"One factor that affected our business performance in the past year is worth mentioning. [SEP] It had a measurable impact on our run rate, our growth rate last year particularly Q2. [SEP] Nevertheless, we were able to recover and even exceed our pre-COVID revenue projections in the latter part of the year.","4889":"We have been reviewing our expenses closely and assessing where we should prioritize our investments. [SEP] But the places where we are more likely to go and put our OpEx in the coming quarters, in the coming years are going to be about revenue that's going to show up for multiple years out. [SEP] We believe that making strategic investments now will position us for long-term growth and profitability.","4890":"Our focus on the commercial cloud has been a key driver of our growth in the past year. We've been putting a lot of effort into improving our gross margins within this segment, and the results have been impressive. [SEP] So our improvement and continued improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin portfolio, I think this is a key criteria of that. [SEP] We're confident that we can continue to drive these improvements going forward. As we invest in new products and services for our commercial cloud customers, we're also working hard to optimize our operations and drive further margin gains. All in all, we believe that our commercial cloud business is well positioned for continued success in the years ahead.","4891":"Now let's talk about the performance of our flagship product, News Feed. [SEP] So on all those measures, we really like what we're seeing and we like the investments that we're making to make that News Feed experience even better. [SEP] We've received positive feedback from users and we're confident that our efforts will lead to sustained growth in the long term.","4892":"We've had a lot of success with our partnership with LinkedIn this quarter. [SEP] And I would also add, Keith, the LinkedIn team has really done a tremendous job. [SEP] Their platform has been a valuable tool for us in attracting top talent and expanding our professional network.","4893":"Our team has been working hard to identify areas where we can improve our profitability. [SEP] I think that we can grow profit dollars, and I think that we can do that in the OpEx guidance I gave you for 2017, as we continue to pivot to that opportunity. [SEP] Additionally, we will be implementing new cost-saving measures throughout the company to help reach our financial goals.","4894":"Now let's move on to our plans for future product developments. [SEP] On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like auto play in feed, but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. [SEP] We believe that by improving the user experience with video content, we can increase engagement and ultimately drive advertising revenue.","4895":"We've received feedback from stakeholders about our company's ethical practices. [SEP] Those are hard questions that at some level, we\u2019re always going to do the best that we can, but we think that having a more democratic process for setting with some of those norms are would be helpful. [SEP] We will be working with our board of directors to establish a more transparent and inclusive system for making these decisions.","4896":"We have seen strong adoption of our cloud services in emerging markets like Brazil and India. [SEP] Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps. [SEP] Overall, we are seeing a lot of growth potential in these markets as more businesses adopt digital solutions and move to the cloud.","4897":"During the quarter, we were focused on expanding our offerings to meet growing demand in the market. [SEP] We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly, both local capacity in the off-season also in our delivery networks. [SEP] However, we have taken steps to address these issues, including hiring additional staff and investing in new technology to improve our delivery efficiency. We are confident that these efforts will pay off in the long run and enable us to achieve our growth targets for the year.","4898":"Our financial report for Q1 shows a strong performance from our company, with an increase in revenue and earnings. [SEP] As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of these companies also went up. [SEP] However, we also noticed a higher level of competition in the market, which may impact our performance in the upcoming quarter.","4899":"Now let's discuss the performance of our product lines. As you all know, we have been focusing heavily on our active devices segment.\"\n- \"Before we move on to Q&A, I want to emphasize the significance of our latest announcement. [SEP] What I think is important, I think the active devices are hugely important and that's the reason that we released the number two years ago, and the reason that we\u2019re releasing that again today. [SEP] In the next quarter, we plan to allocate more resources towards enhancing our active devices, as we see tremendous growth potential in this area.\"\n- \"Overall, I believe that our commitment to innovation and staying ahead of the curve in terms of technology will continue to drive success for our company.","4900":"We had a strong finish to the year, meeting our revenue goals for the fourth quarter. As expected, this quarter was heavily focused on holiday sales. [SEP] Fourth quarter is a holiday quarter, so our top verticals were ecommerce, CPG and retail. [SEP] Ecommerce continued to be our top vertical, with a significant increase in online shopping due to the pandemic. CPG also saw strong sales during the holiday season, with consumers stocking up on essential household items. Our retail partners also performed well, benefiting from our targeted marketing campaigns and promotions.","4901":"We've been seeing great growth across all of our products, and we're excited about the future. [SEP] I do think to your point that the monetization paths are going to be somewhat different, reflecting the differences in product philosophy. [SEP] However, we remain confident that both paths will lead to continued success and profitability for the company.","4902":"We have seen tremendous growth in our Messenger platform over the past year. [SEP] The vast, vast majority, virtually all of Messenger users, are using News Feed as well. [SEP] This cross-platform usage has driven significant engagement and revenue growth for our company.","4903":"We've seen a significant increase in demand for video content in the past year. [SEP] And then on the other hand, we also need to improve the infrastructure to deliver the best videos to people and do that quickly. [SEP] Our team is currently exploring options to optimize our video delivery network and improve load times.","4904":"One analyst on the call asked about Apple's strategy moving forward. [SEP] It\u2019s - my view is that it\u2019s sort of a transitional kind of thing and we invest for the long term, so we are continuing to invest for Apple\u2019s future. [SEP] We believe that our investments will pay off in the long run and will position us for sustained success in the market,\" the executive concluded.","4905":"One analyst on the call asked about the company's plans for improving its delivery capabilities. [SEP] We are working very hard to expand our one-day capacity, add carriers, add delivery partners at our own AMZL capability and have our partners expand their capabilities as well. [SEP] We know that fast and reliable delivery is crucial to our customers, and we are constantly striving to meet and exceed their expectations,\" the CEO added.","4906":"We are constantly working to expand the capabilities of our platform. [SEP] So on the first axis, you get everything ranging from text to links, to photos, to videos, to immersive 360 videos and virtual reality content and this progression. [SEP] Our goal is to provide users with a seamless, immersive experience that keeps them engaged and interested for longer periods of time.","4907":"Now let's take a look at our head count growth over the past few years. [SEP] If you'll remember, we grew head count 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. [SEP] We're proud of these numbers, as they represent our commitment to expanding our team and building a strong workforce.","4908":"Now, turning to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] If I had to point to what's really leading us to tighten the range, it's really the first factor which is the safety and security investments [SEP] Overall, we remain committed to investing in our safety and security measures to ensure our customers and employees feel confident and secure when using our services.","4909":"Our capital expenditure this quarter was primarily focused on improving our infrastructure. [SEP] We have been -- for our servers and we had been depreciating them over three years.

One feature that customers seem to particularly appreciate is the collaboration capabilities. [SEP] And I think it's an important component of our M 365 value, but it's really not outsized. [SEP] That being said, we're always looking for ways to improve the product. We have a team dedicated to analyzing how customers are using Microsoft 365 and identifying areas where we can add more value.","4912":"Moving on to our messaging platform, we have seen a significant increase in user engagement over the past quarter.

[SEP] We are excited to announce that we will be introducing new tools and features to make it even easier for businesses to connect with their customers through our messaging platform.","4913":"In terms of our fulfillment network, I want to highlight that it performed exceptionally well during the holiday season. We delivered more than one billion items worldwide with Prime free shipping, and our network of fulfillment centers and transportation operations processed a record-breaking number of orders. [SEP] So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. [SEP] In response to this capacity increase, we are continuing to invest in our fulfillment network. In the first quarter of this year, we added 26 new fulfillment centers and announced plans for six more in the coming months. These investments are critical to meet customer demand and support continued growth in our business.","4914":"We've been exploring the use of bots to improve customer service efficiency.

[SEP] In fact, our initial tests with bots have shown a significant increase in customer satisfaction ratings.","4915":"Our efforts to increase user engagement on Facebook have been ongoing throughout the year. We understand the importance of keeping users engaged and active on our platform, which is why we've implemented various strategies to improve the user experience.

As we continue to work with publishers and invest in our platform, we are confident that we can deliver even greater value to our users and shareholders.","4916":"Our team has been closely monitoring the potential impact of geopolitical tensions on our business operations. There's been a lot of speculation and concern in the media about how these tensions will affect economic growth and trade globally. [SEP] And so I think generally this has been, at least as we see it, maybe it's not true for other businesses, that this worry is probably overstated. [SEP] Of course, we understand that any disruption to supply chains or market access could have significant implications for our industry. However, we've taken steps to mitigate these risks by diversifying our supplier base and exploring new markets for export. \n\nOverall, we remain confident in our ability to weather any challenges that may arise in the current geopolitical climate.

Our focus in the upcoming months will be on further penetrating emerging markets and increasing our operational efficiencies.","4920":"Now turning to our messaging products.

Our ability to provide tailored solutions to our customers has been a key driver, as businesses seek to transform how they operate in a rapidly changing digital landscape. [SEP] That cloud-led conversation and making a plan for customers to best change and transform their own business certainly is a far more in-depth one than on occasion is required by long-time Transactional purchasers, especially in Office, as an example, because what we're talking about now is really pivoting your business for the long term. [SEP] We are investing heavily in resources to support our customers as they make this transition.

[SEP] So when you say killer apps, the killer apps are how are customers able to reimagine how they think about customer engagement, how they think about employee empowerment or the operational efficiency, or how they can change the products and the business models and the products.

[SEP] To maximize the time users spend in ad load, we have implemented a more streamlined ad experience that minimizes disruptions to their browsing experience. We anticipate continued growth in impression numbers as a result.","4938":"As we delve into the factors that impacted our growth this quarter, there are a few key areas to focus on. [SEP] The first is just the evolution of the regulatory landscape, and here I would point to regulations like GDPR. [SEP] Another important factor was the shift in consumer behavior, particularly in response to the pandemic.","4939":"Our company has continued to see growth throughout the year, especially in our messaging platforms. [SEP] One interesting example recently that I touched on earlier is between Messenger and WhatsApp, we're around 60 billion messages a day. [SEP] This level of communication shows just how integral our platforms are to our users' daily lives, and we are proud to continue to be a leading provider in this space.","4940":"Now turning to our performance by region. [SEP] And as I look geographically, where we've been doing really good in the emerging markets, our share is still not high in any of them, and so there's a lot of headroom there as well, as there is in most developed markets as well [SEP] Overall, we are optimistic about our growth prospects and confident in our ability to seize opportunities in both emerging and developed markets.","4941":"We've been closely watching the regulatory developments and platform changes that have taken place over the past few months. As we've noted before, these changes are likely to have a significant impact on our business and the businesses of our clients. [SEP] And I think it's important to note that the regulatory and platform changes will have a disproportionate impact on the ability of small businesses to use ads to grow and thrive. [SEP] That being said, we're confident that our team has the expertise and agility needed to navigate these changes and continue delivering results for our clients. We'll be closely monitoring the situation and making any necessary adjustments to our strategies as we go.","4942":"Looking at our performance this quarter, we have identified areas where we need to make significant changes. [SEP] We need to improve in each one of the elements, but all-up we need to improve because we think that increased opportunity is what's unique about our approach. [SEP] Our competitors are also making strides in improving their offerings, so we need to step up our game to stay ahead in the market.","4943":"We're really focused on driving user engagement. [SEP] Then within that installed base, of course we want to make sure that there are more people that are so interested in our services that in addition to transacting on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those services.

As you all know, we take customer satisfaction very seriously and have been working diligently to improve our delivery speeds. [SEP] And then on the logistics question, stepping back, the reason we add logistics capability and transportation capability is so we can serve our customers faster and faster delivery speeds and we've needed to add more of our own capacity to supplement our carriers and our partners.

[SEP] But we see the potential for this to be a major part of our business going forward.","4977":"We've seen some competitive offers from our rivals in the wireless industry. [SEP] But I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers.

As we stated earlier, advertising revenue was the main driver of our overall revenue growth this quarter. [SEP] We've talked about the drivers of supply being growth in DAU, growth in time spent per DAU and ad load, and obviously, we've given stats around rough stats around \u2013 we've given specific stats around DAU. [SEP] Additionally, we saw strong growth in our ad load, which was driven by increased demand from advertisers. We remain focused on improving engagement and user experience while also delivering value to our advertising partners.","4987":"Our goal is to provide our business partners with a seamless experience when it comes to communication and transactions. We understand the importance of building lasting relationships with our clients. [SEP] And then you can complete the transactions and follow up with businesses individually and have an ongoing relationship through Messenger and WhatsApp. [SEP] We have received tremendous feedback from businesses who have already begun using our messaging platforms for their transactions. Our team is dedicated to providing ongoing support to ensure your success in using these tools.","4988":"Our team has been working tirelessly to increase our market share and I am proud to report that our efforts have paid off. [SEP] And IDC\u2019s estimate of the market for last quarter is a 16%, so we grew two and a half times. [SEP] We have several exciting product launches planned for the upcoming quarter and we are confident that this growth trend will continue.","4989":"So now I'll turn to our financial performance over the last quarter. We are pleased to report that we exceeded our revenue projections by 10% and our earnings per share were 15% higher than expected. [SEP] It is very, very important I think for investors to understand that what's happened during the last two years [SEP] has been a unique and unpredictable set of circumstances that nobody could have predicted. Our team has had to pivot and adapt constantly to keep up with rapidly changing consumer behavior and market conditions. Looking ahead, we are confident that we have the agility and resilience to navigate whatever challenges may come our way.","4990":"Now let's turn our attention to our iPhone segment. [SEP] So in summary, our guidance for iPhone; we got double digit year-over-year growth and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis. [SEP] This is driven by strong demand for our latest models and our successful launch in new markets.","4991":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to the current state of the industry. [SEP] It\u2019s certainly a competitive market that we see and we\u2019ve seen for really a number of years. [SEP] Despite the competition, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities and grow our market share.","4992":"During Q2, we experienced strong demand for our e-commerce offerings as customers continue to turn to us for their shopping needs. We also saw strong growth in our Prime membership program. [SEP] The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships, and as I said, we had the largest new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. [SEP] We remain focused on expanding the benefits of Prime and enhancing the customer experience. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead and believe that our continued investments will drive sustained growth in Prime and across our business. Thank you for your continued support.","4993":"We have been discussing our financial planning for the next quarter and the upcoming fiscal year. [SEP] So I myself, in fact one of the things that Amy and I do, is when we think about our CapEx, we think about all these layers together. [SEP] This helps us ensure that we are making strategic investments that will benefit our company in the long run.","4994":"As we prioritize increased connectivity and customer satisfaction, we are constantly exploring new partnerships and initiatives. [SEP] That's why we are working with Alexa, we would welcome it on our devices [SEP] And we believe that integrating Alexa into our products is a step in the right direction toward achieving those goals.","4995":"Our Q1 financial results have been impacted by various factors, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the launch of our new product line. Despite these challenges, we are pleased to report growth in several markets. In particular, I want to highlight our performance in Japan, which was a standout during the same quarter last year. [SEP] And we also had a very, very strong quarter in Japan in the March quarter a year ago, which was driven by very significant carrier promotional activities, and a pull forward of sales into the March quarter in anticipation of a consumption tax increase that took place on April 1, and again that is not going to repeat. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued uncertainty and volatility in the global economy, which may affect consumer spending and market demand. However, we will remain focused on delivering innovative products and services to our customers and expanding our global footprint. While we do not expect a repeat of the exceptional results in Japan from last year's Q1, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects.","4996":"As we look ahead to the future of our company, there are two key initiatives that we believe will drive growth and create significant value for our shareholders. [SEP] And the second is having a business partnership with news publishers that I think can be sustainable over the long term. [SEP] Our team has already begun discussions with several major publishers, and we are very optimistic about the potential of these partnerships to help us achieve our goals.","4997":"Our focus on improving our mobile platform has been a key driver of growth this quarter. [SEP] First, we're improving our Android experiences, and we've talked about the impact that Facebook Lite has had on that, just making easier registration processes, just making Android \u2013 our lightweight Android app easier to use. [SEP] In addition to our Android improvements, we are also exploring new features for our iOS app, including streamlined checkout processes and personalized recommendations.","4998":"Now, I would like to discuss our performance for the quarter. [SEP] There was some on-prem strength this quarter, it does show-up in bookings, it doesn\u2019t show up in unearned and it does show up in the P&L, we had a good quarter there. [SEP] Moving forward, we plan to continue investing in our on-premises offering to capitalize on this strength.","4999":"We're pleased to report on our performance in the Greater China region. [SEP] This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double digit growth in Greater China. [SEP] Our success in this market is due in part to our strong partnerships and investments in local talent and infrastructure.","5000":"Thank you for joining us today on our earnings conference call. We are pleased to report a strong quarter with revenue growth of 10%. [SEP] So it\u2019s still early and what we\u2019re focused on really at this point is relevancy, making sure that the ads are relevant to our customers, helpful to our customers, and to do that, we use machine learning and that\u2019s helping us to drive better, better and better relevancy. [SEP] Our continued investment in machine learning has been critical in helping us to achieve this goal. We are seeing significant improvements in ad relevancy and this is translating into increased engagement from our customers. Looking forward, we remain committed to leveraging the latest technology to drive even better results for our business and our customers.","5001":"As we continue to innovate and expand our product line, we've been focused on ensuring that we're meeting the needs of every customer. [SEP] We wanted to make sure that we have competitive Windows ecosystem participation across all the price points. [SEP] Our efforts have paid off, as we're now seeing strong sales across a broad range of devices and price points.","5002":"Our team worked diligently to navigate the challenges in the global marketplace as we continue to adapt to the ongoing pandemic. [SEP] And during the quarter tactically the emerging markets had a bit of a rebound. [SEP] We anticipate continued growth in these regions and are strategically planning for future expansion opportunities.","5003":"We are currently in discussions with regulatory agencies regarding new industry regulations and standards. [SEP] And my broader concern is that if that doesn\u2019t get put in place, then frustration with the industry, I think, will continue to grow. [SEP] Our team is committed to working closely with these agencies to implement necessary changes and ensure transparency for all stakeholders.","5004":"In response to a question about a potential new feature on the social media platform. [SEP] We\u2019re testing it in a handful of countries to start just to make sure that we have the UI and interaction simple enough that people could express more of what they wanted without getting in their way, it is adding a little bit of complexity to something that is very simple, say just a one tap like button. [SEP] But we're excited about the potential for this feature and will continue to refine it based on user feedback.","5005":"We're now going to move on to talk about our advertising business, which has continued to grow and evolve over the past quarter. We're seeing some exciting trends and developments, especially in the area of Stories. [SEP] And so we think the mix shift to Stories is a big opportunity for us and it's going to take time to continue to get advertisers in, but we're very happy with demand to date. [SEP] Of course, we're not resting on our laurels and we're constantly looking for new ways to innovate and improve our advertising offerings. We're confident that we're on the right track and that we'll continue to see strong demand for our products and services in the coming quarters. Thank you all for joining us today.","5006":"So, now let's talk a little bit about customer preferences. [SEP] I would say I talked about sort of the reasons the three big reasons why customers choose our cloud in our cloud infrastructure in particular. [SEP] But, I want to dive a little deeper into the specifics of those reasons and how we're continuing to improve upon them.","5007":"We've had a strong quarter with robust earnings and revenue growth that exceeded our expectations. Our teams have executed flawlessly and our customers are showing strong demand for our offerings. [SEP] We\u2019re super confident about the pipeline of products and services that we have, and therefore, we believe that there is great value in our stock. [SEP] We recognize there are market uncertainties and risks ahead, but we are well positioned to navigate them. Our focus remains on delivering differentiated products and services that meet the needs of our customers and create value for our shareholders. We remain committed to investing in innovation, driving operational efficiency, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Through these efforts, we are confident that we can sustain growth and enhance shareholder value over the long term.","5008":"Our international expansion strategy is proving to be successful as we continue to see growth in many countries. [SEP] Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. [SEP] We are doubling down on our efforts to increase our reach and market share in those regions.","5009":"During the third quarter, we experienced strong growth in our key markets and exceeded our revenue and profit targets. [SEP] But we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are launching now and we've launched already a few during the September quarter and that will have an impact on our December quarter results. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of these new products and believe they will provide significant value to our customers. Additionally, we are implementing cost-cutting measures to mitigate the impact on our bottom line in the short term.","5010":"During the past quarter, we experienced growth in international markets, particularly in Brazil. [SEP] You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and e-books offering without the sort of physical categories and, more recently, added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering. [SEP] Our expansion into the physical book market in Brazil has been successful, with strong sales and positive feedback from customers.","5011":"We've been monitoring our supply chain very closely over the last several months, and we're pleased to report that we've been able to maintain excellent relationships with our carriers. Our teams are working closely together to ensure smooth transportation of our products around the world. [SEP] We have a great group of carriers that we use globally and you know who they are. [SEP] As we continue to grow and expand into new markets, we're always looking for ways to improve our logistics and supply chain operations. We value our partnerships with our carriers and look forward to continued success in the years ahead. Thank you for joining us today on the call.","5012":"Our company has seen significant growth in the past year, driven by our focus on digital transformation. We have invested heavily in new technologies and have seen positive results in customer adoption rates. [SEP] And so, when I look at the businesses that we've built and the businesses we're investing in and do I feel like this needs for tech intensity that Satya talked about, that will ultimately drive the desire and need for customers to adopt technology, we're in the right places. [SEP] As we move forward, we plan to continue investing in technologies that will enhance our customers' experiences and drive our growth. Our team is constantly seeking new ways to innovate and improve our offerings, and we are confident that we will continue to succeed in this dynamic market. With our strong foundation and commitment to tech intensity, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.","5013":"So looking at the sales figures, we are thrilled to report that we exceeded our expectations for this quarter. Our team worked incredibly hard to not only maintain our market position but to also expand our reach. [SEP] We sold more units than we thought we would and so that was a part of that. [SEP] However, we did experience some unexpected costs in production which affected our profit margins. We are actively working to address these issues and ensure we can continue to grow while also maintaining financial stability. Overall, though, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and excited for what the future holds.","5014":"When you look at our growth in the cloud space over the past year, it's been really remarkable [SEP] And I think, in fact unlike any other time other than Windows, we've not had this kind of platform effect. [SEP] Our goal is to continue to build on this platform effect and create even more value for our customers.","5015":"Another question from the line is from Karl about the recent surge in expenses. [SEP] Karl, thanks for asking that question; it gives me a chance to reiterate how many of those components are bit one-time in nature. [SEP] However, we are constantly reviewing our expenses and identifying areas where we can optimize costs in the long run.","5016":"We have seen a decline in revenue due to the end of support frame for our on-premise products. However, we are encouraged by the growth of our cloud-based solutions which have been steadily gaining traction. [SEP] And so when it's annuity based there is really no opportunity to see it as upside in Q4 from an end of support frame. [SEP] While we do not expect any immediate improvement in our Q4 performance due to the annuity based structure of our cloud products, we are confident in their long-term potential for revenue growth. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in the development and expansion of these solutions to maximize their impact on our business.","5017":"The company has seen significant growth in international markets.\n- Shareholders asked about the company's approach to global regulation and how it could impact their investments. [SEP] Well, one of the things that I\u2019ve been focused on is trying to help develop global frameworks where possible, but the challenge of course, with that is that except in a limited number of cases, regulation typically isn\u2019t global; it\u2019s national. [SEP] Despite the challenges with diverse regulations, the company remains committed to operating within legal frameworks in all countries where it does business.\n- We are actively engaging with policymakers to encourage more collaboration on international regulations.","5018":"Now moving on to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] On the CapEx guidance, this is really just about better visibility on how spend will come through. [SEP] We have also identified some areas where we can optimize our spending and reduce unnecessary costs.","5019":"We recognize that the smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated. In order to stay competitive and continue to grow, we need to look beyond just phones. [SEP] The big shift that we are making when it comes to phones is to not think about phones in isolation. [SEP] We are focusing on creating an ecosystem of devices and services that seamlessly integrate with each other. This means developing products like smartwatches, tablets, and home assistants that work together to provide a comprehensive user experience. By doing this, we believe we can set ourselves apart from our competitors and provide our customers with a truly connected experience.","5020":"During the last quarter, we successfully acquired XYZ Company and added their technology solutions to our portfolio. [SEP] And we went through this process of integrating that and making sure that it\u2019s integrated with all these system well. [SEP] As a result of this integration process, we have seen increased efficiency and effectiveness in our operations. Our teams are now able to access all necessary data and information through one centralized system, improving overall productivity. Thank you for your attention and we look forward to sharing more updates in our next earnings call.","5021":"Thanks for your question. [SEP] On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well. [SEP] We're constantly striving to improve our logistical operations and provide the best possible experience for our customers.","5022":"We have seen significant growth in user activity over the past quarter. [SEP] But across all of the different types of content issues of people trying to spread hate or incite violence. [SEP] Our content moderation team has been working diligently to identify and remove any harmful content as quickly as possible.","5023":"We've seen a significant increase in user engagement on our platform. [SEP] And people in our community, they don't know the difference about whether that content is coming from Facebook or a different place. [SEP] This is a testament to the strength of our content curation and recommendation algorithms.","5024":"Our goal is to provide seamless and productive experiences for our users across all of our platforms. [SEP] And so, you will see us \u2013 with Windows 10, so you'll see us continue to do these integrations that add value again to both the Microsoft 365 and Dynamics users, as well as LinkedIn members. [SEP] This will not only benefit our current users but also attract new customers to our integrated ecosystem.","5025":"Moving on to our regional performance, let's start with the Rest of World segment. [SEP] And then rest of world, we saw some countries come back online like Ethiopia came back online. [SEP] However, we did experience some challenges in other markets such as Venezuela and Iran due to economic and political issues.","5026":"In terms of advertising, we saw significant growth in the number of ads delivered to users during the quarter. [SEP] Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunities to continue to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on our other apps such as Instagram. [SEP] As we continue to expand our presence globally and invest in new products and features, we believe there is still ample room for growth in the advertising space for both Facebook and our other properties.","5027":"Now turning to our financial performance for the quarter [SEP] And then on your question of marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was up 110 basis points year-over-year. [SEP] We continue to invest in targeted marketing campaigns to drive organic growth as well as customer acquisition through strategic partnerships.","5028":"We've seen some challenges in the market recently that have led us to re-evaluate our projections for the rest of the year. [SEP] So really, it\u2019s the compounding of those three issues that are creating headwinds that we think are going to impact us, as we get later in the year and into 2020. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to adapt and make necessary changes to continue delivering value to our shareholders.","5029":"Now let's take a closer look at our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] If you back out exchange that\u2019s approximately breakeven, included in there we certainly have a sizeable step up in investment in India. [SEP] However, we believe this investment is critical for our long-term growth strategy in the region.","5030":"We have seen incredible growth in our advertising revenue in the past quarter, due to our strategic efforts and investments. [SEP] And, again, that's a big part of what we're trying to do to drive the overall ads growth story, as well as providing a good experience for users with the ads that they're seeing. [SEP] In addition, we plan to continue investing in research and development to improve our ad targeting capabilities and provide even more relevant and personalized ads for our users.","5031":"During the past quarter, we've been focusing on improving the user experience on our platform. We identified that the quality of the content and the ability to share it with others were two areas that needed improvement. [SEP] So we ran a bunch of qualitative studies and talked to a bunch of people and incorporated those signals into the model, and that has had the result that the people in our community who gave us that feedback and who we worked with on this, what we had expected in terms of both increasing the quality of the content that people see, and therefore also enabling people to share more with their friends and the people that they want. [SEP] We're very pleased with the results we've seen from these changes. User engagement has increased by 25%, and we've seen a significant uptick in the number of new users signing up for the platform. We will continue to monitor user feedback and make adjustments as needed to ensure that our platform remains a valuable resource for our community.","5032":"As we look towards our expansion plans for the upcoming quarter, we're excited to announce our focus on entering the South American market. [SEP] We have a lot to do there, we think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. [SEP] Our team has been conducting extensive market research and we are confident that our product will satisfy the needs of consumers in this region. We will be deploying additional resources to ensure we are successful in establishing a strong presence in South America.","5033":"Now let me move on to our financial performance for the second quarter. [SEP] So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. [SEP] In terms of operating income, we expect to see a range of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, compared to $3.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020.","5034":"We have seen great success over the past year in building strong relationships with our customers. [SEP] And we have the business model that aligns with them and their interests and the trust. [SEP] Our team is committed to continuing to prioritize customer satisfaction, as we believe it is crucial to our continued growth and success.","5035":"We believe that measurement is a really important area for our industry, for our advertisers, and for us if we're going to enable the best advertising experiences possible. Without measurement, there's no way for us to know whether the advertising that's being delivered is actually effective. [SEP] because if we can connect, people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy, in stores or in other ways, that's how you close the loop and that's why we put so much investment and hopefully so much innovation behind measurement. [SEP] We've made a lot of progress in this area, but we still have a long way to go. We're continuing to invest heavily in measurement technology and are looking for innovative ways to close the loop between advertising and purchasing behavior. We're committed to providing our advertisers with the best possible tools to measure the impact of their ads and make more informed decisions about their marketing investments.","5036":"Can you provide some more detail on the fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter? [SEP] It was very lumpy this time with 18 warehouses in one quarter and another five in the first three weeks of the next quarter. [SEP] How do you plan to address this uneven distribution of warehouse openings in the future?","5037":"Our earnings for this quarter were strong, with a significant increase in revenue from our Azure cloud services. [SEP] So, I\u2019m actually hoping that going into this next fiscal year, we do a much better job and customers do a much better job, but they don\u2019t benefit because the advantage Azure has because of the hybrid used benefits across the entire workload are pretty phenomenal, and we had a good set of sessions at our partner meetings this week just really making sure that everybody understand those benefits. [SEP] We believe that hybrid cloud solutions will continue to be in high demand, and we are investing heavily in developing our offerings in this area. Additionally, we are seeing growing interest in our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, which we believe will be a major source of growth in the coming years.","5038":"Our latest financial results reflect the successful launch and adoption of Windows 10 across all segments, especially in the enterprise. [SEP] I think the overall adoption cycle of Windows 10 in the enterprise is perhaps the best that we have seen in the enterprise for any new release of Windows, and primarily driven by security and manageability of the new Windows, and that's what's been the driver. [SEP] We are committed to continuing to improve and innovate the Windows ecosystem to meet the evolving needs of our enterprise customers and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.","5039":"Moving on to our financial results, I'd like to highlight a couple of important factors that have affected our performance this quarter. [SEP] The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of life and we dealt with it for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated against the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. [SEP] Despite this challenge, we have been able to maintain strong sales numbers by focusing our efforts on emerging markets where our products are still highly competitive.","5040":"Now turning to our performance in the grocery sector. [SEP] So if you adjust for those, with the Whole Foods growth year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis was approximately 6%. [SEP] We anticipate continued growth in this area and have plans for expansion in several key regions.","5041":"We have been evaluating the feasibility of expanding our operations in India. [SEP] And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection and better convenience for the Indian customer. [SEP] However, we will continue to monitor the Indian market and explore opportunities for growth in the future.","5042":"Thank you for your question, Steve. [SEP] And I will think general what we see, especially as contract gets larger, for us the opportunity under Tier 1 workloads for us to really see TAM growth. [SEP] Our focus on innovation and efficiency has been key in securing new contracts and expanding our market share.","5043":"Now let's delve into our overall business strategy. [SEP] Just to recap the framework that we have here, the strategy is there are three phases for that. [SEP] The first phase involves market analysis and product development, followed by a roll-out phase where we enter the market and establish a customer base, and lastly, the scaling phase where we aim to increase market share and profitability.","5044":"Our team has been working diligently to prepare for the enterprise deployment phase, which we anticipate will be a significant milestone for our company. [SEP] We expect the enterprise deployment to start in earnest the beginning of next calendar year or the second half of this fiscal year. [SEP] We recognize that many of our stakeholders are eagerly anticipating this next step, and we are committed to keeping everyone informed of our progress and any potential challenges that may arise. Thank you for your continued support and investment in our success.","5045":"We have seen strong revenue growth in the past quarter, and our team has been very pleased with the performance of our advertising initiatives. [SEP] So I think we're still seeing good growth in Europe on the revenue front, and a lot of the similar dynamics playing out in Europe as in the rest of the world where you see good impression growth opportunity, especially in areas like Instagram and Stories contributing to overall ability to drive revenue growth. [SEP] Looking ahead to the next quarter, we are confident that we will continue to see significant growth in Europe and other key markets around the world.","5046":"Now let's move on to a region-specific analysis of our Q4 earnings. [SEP] To give you a perspective in of some detail, our business in India in Q4 was flat. [SEP] However, our overall revenue for the quarter saw a significant increase due to the successful launch of our new product line in North America.","5047":"We are excited to share with you the progress we have made in our digital transformation strategy. [SEP] In fact you should think of Azure as the common fabric of all our applications. [SEP] By leveraging Azure, we have been able to improve our efficiency and responsiveness to customer needs.","5048":"We have seen strong growth in our online sales channel this quarter. [SEP] So there is, in that sense, a cannibalistic effect of sorts that happens there. [SEP] However, we believe that ultimately the shift to online purchasing will lead to greater overall revenue for the company.","5049":"Our focus has always been on providing the best possible customer experience. [SEP] We added, of course, we have over 100 million items that customers would get within two days, but there's now over 3 million that will be delivered within one day or faster in 10,000 cities in town. [SEP] This has been made possible due to our investments in our logistics and delivery systems, as well as expanding our network of warehouses and fulfillment centers.","5050":"Our financial results for the previous quarter have been stellar, with our revenue exceeding expectations. We have been working tirelessly to grow our iPhone sales and we have reason to believe that our efforts will pay off. [SEP] We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base that on what we are seeing from a switcher point of view, we recorded the highest rate on record for Android switches last quarter at 30%. [SEP] Furthermore, we are seeing a strong demand for the latest iPhone models, particularly from emerging markets. We are confident that we will continue to gain market share and deliver strong results in the coming quarters. We will continue to invest in product innovation and customer experience to maintain our competitive edge.","5051":"Our company has been investing heavily in developing online marketplaces that have grown significantly in popularity over the past year. [SEP] I mean, we have Facebook Marketplace is probably the most advanced and hundreds of millions of people use that to buy and sell things. [SEP] We are continuing to explore new ways to enhance our existing marketplaces and potentially launch new ones to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","5052":"We've seen a lot of interest in our new subscription service over the past month. Many customers have taken advantage of our 30-day trial offer and signed up to try it out. [SEP] People are just coming out of the 30-day trial period in the last few days or week or so. [SEP] We're now analyzing the data from those who completed the trial period to assess the success of the program and determine our next steps. We're optimistic about the results so far and believe that we can continue to drive adoption and revenue growth over the coming quarters.","5053":"We've had several factors impacting our advertising revenue this quarter. [SEP] And then the second factor is just we're seeing proposed changes from the mobile platforms that are more oriented towards privacy which could affect targeting and measurement and make that more difficult. [SEP] However, despite these challenges, we are confident in our ability to adapt and continue to provide value to our advertisers and users. We have several initiatives underway to mitigate the impact of these changes and find new avenues for revenue growth.","5054":"We are pleased to report strong growth in our productivity software division. [SEP] The small business number I talked about, the 50,000 per month additional customers that we're adding to Office 365. [SEP] This growth in Office 365 adoption is largely driven by our continued investment in new features and capabilities that make it an essential tool for small businesses.","5055":"We're now going to take some questions from the analysts on the call. [SEP] Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. [SEP] But overall, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter.","5056":"Another question we have is about your plans for expanding into new markets. [SEP] We're excited about this kind of thing but this is as early as anything could be. [SEP] Can you elaborate on the current stage of development and when we can expect more concrete details?","5057":"As we continue to analyze our growth trends across our different platforms, we wanted to highlight the performance of Instagram. [SEP] So we\u2019re certainly seeing good growth in places where Instagram is strong, including the U.S., so that\u2019s been good to see. [SEP] In addition to the U.S., we're also seeing strong growth in key international markets where Instagram has a strong presence.","5058":"We are pleased to share with you our fourth quarter earnings report. [SEP] The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. [SEP] This achievement would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our entire team.","5059":"Our new product line had a slow start due to supply chain issues and delayed shipments. [SEP] But we were able to get this in a lot of different merchants and I give them a lot of credit for that. [SEP] As a result of their efforts, we saw a significant increase in sales and brand awareness in the past quarter.","5060":"Now let's turn to our financial results for this quarter. [SEP] Our overall long term under imbalance has been impacted by the Windows 10 deferral over the past. [SEP] However, we are optimistic about the outlook for the next quarter as we expect to see the impact of our recent product launches and marketing initiatives.","5061":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] There\u2019s a foreign exchange element, and I mentioned before the negative impact on a sequential basis about 40 basis points. [SEP] However, on a year-over-year basis, the impact was positive, contributing 20 basis points to our overall revenue growth.","5062":"Our advertising team has been working hard to identify areas where we can continue to expand our reach and provide value to our clients. [SEP] I think we've taken our experience on how to help advertisers migrate to the right places and been able to do that even more quickly in new formats like Stories. [SEP] As we move forward, we plan to continue leveraging our experience and expertise to help our advertising partners successfully navigate new platforms and formats.","5063":"Now, let's move on to our advertising segment. Our advertising revenue was up 28% year-over-year, reaching a total of $16.6 billion. We continue to see strong demand from our advertisers across all regions and industries. [SEP] So on the first, we announced that we have over 2 million advertisers who are buying ads on Facebook. [SEP] As we mentioned in our last quarter, we are investing heavily in improving our ad targeting capabilities and ad formats to provide a better experience for both users and advertisers. We also expect to see continued growth in our advertising revenue from our Stories feature and from our newer advertising channels like Messenger and WhatsApp.","5064":"Can you clarify the revenue breakdown between your consumer and enterprise segments in North America?\"\n- \"How much of your overall revenue comes from advertising in North America? [SEP] Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an advertising part of our North American consume segments. [SEP] But can you give us an idea of how much growth you're seeing in the advertising segment compared to the rest of your consumer business?\"\n- \"So, do you foresee any changes to your advertising strategy in the coming quarters?","5065":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our marketplace business, which has been a significant area of focus for us this quarter.\"\n- \"We've been closely tracking several key metrics and are pleased with the progress we're making. [SEP] We're really encouraged with what we are seeing, both on the customer side and the seller side. [SEP] One area of particular strength has been our international expansion efforts, where we've seen a steady increase in both customer and seller activity.\"\n- \"Overall, we feel confident in our ability to continue driving growth in the marketplace and remain committed to investing in this important area of our business.","5066":"We're now going to take some questions from the analysts. [SEP] On CapEx, we still expect to be within the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, and we're investing aggressively in our data center footprint to support the global growth that we see. [SEP] Our investments in AI and machine learning are also continuing, and we're seeing promising results from these initiatives.","5067":"Can you give us an update on how your company is positioned among the competition in the market? [SEP] As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we provide to customers. [SEP] However, we are constantly monitoring and analyzing our competitors' strategies and adjusting our own approach accordingly. We believe that staying proactive and innovative is crucial to maintaining our position as a market leader.","5068":"One question that investors may have is about the company's growth strategy. [SEP] It's not a simple thing that you can apply a set formula to or one variable or a couple of variable formula in my opinion. [SEP] Therefore, it's important that we continue to analyze the data and look at multiple factors to make informed decisions in our business operations.","5069":"Now moving on to our investment strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] So the way we think about our overall investment, I think of this as a systems investment [SEP] By investing in a cohesive system, we believe we can maximize efficiency and profitability across all of our operations.","5070":"Our database segment continues to be a strong performer for us. [SEP] We have a very good business in SQL Server, we have perhaps the most competitive SQL Server product ever in SQL 2014, which is growing nicely. [SEP] We're also excited about the potential growth opportunities in the cloud computing space for SQL Server.","5071":"Our team has been working hard to diversify our revenue streams. While traditional product sales are still a major part of our business, we recognize the importance of expanding into services. [SEP] And so as we are able to grow the services business, that should provide a positive, a tailwind. [SEP] Of course, there will be challenges along the way. We will need to invest in training and hiring additional staff to support our services offerings. But we are confident that this shift in focus will ultimately pay off for our company and our shareholders in the long run.","5072":"Thank you for that question. [SEP] On the category mix question, you know, obviously category mix does play a role in the gross margin. [SEP] However, we have taken measures to optimize our category mix to maintain healthy margins and continue delivering value to our customers.","5073":"We are always looking for ways to engage players and enhance their gaming experience. [SEP] It's not just about EA attach although it absolutely can be one of the motions. [SEP] Our focus is on delivering quality content and creating long-term relationships with our players.","5074":"Our goal for this quarter was to continue our expansion efforts into new markets, and we're thrilled to report that we've successfully launched in three new countries. [SEP] In the past quarter we expanded further internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program, again, offering free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items. [SEP] We're seeing great uptake and positive feedback from customers in these markets, which is encouraging us to explore additional international opportunities. We remain committed to providing our customers with fast and convenient delivery options, and we're excited for what's to come in the future.","5075":"We saw significant growth in our advertising revenue this quarter. Our team worked hard to develop new ad formats and improve targeting capabilities. [SEP] And teaching people here is what a Facebook ad looks like was a new format people had to understand. [SEP] Despite the learning curve, we are proud of the progress our team and advertisers have made with Facebook ads. We will continue to innovate and improve our offerings to provide better results for our advertising partners.","5076":"We've been investing heavily in our data analytics capabilities over the last few years. Our focus has been on building out a robust data ecosystem that enables us to gain deeper insights into our business operations and customer behavior. [SEP] And given that, we want to have these leading indicators showing up in our dashboard not are static reports and Power BI is this rich canvas for us to be able to, one, visualize data as well as ask natural language questions. [SEP] In fact, we're now working towards integrating Power BI with our other data management tools to create a more seamless user experience for our analysts and business users. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to access and interpret our data in a more intuitive and efficient way. We believe the combination of leading indicators and dynamic visualizations will empower us to make smarter, more informed decisions about our business strategy going forward.","5077":"Our earnings report for this quarter has been very positive, with strong performance across all our business units. Our mobile News Feed apps in particular have been a key driver of our success. [SEP] The business continues to perform very well, driven off the strength of our mobile News Feed apps business, and really consistent with the trend we've seen in the last several quarters, we would expect that year-over-year ads growth rate to decline modestly in Q3 and Q4, and it's really a function of the law of large numbers and the natural maturation of our ad business. [SEP] However, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of our ad business, and we will continue to invest in new technologies and strategies to drive growth and innovation. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter and look forward to building on this momentum in the months ahead.","5078":"We've been closely monitoring the performance of our emerging markets, and while we've seen some challenges, overall we're pleased with the progress we've made. [SEP] And so I think, or at least the way that I see these, is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story, and I don't see it as some sort of issue that is common between those for the most part. [SEP] Of course, there are always going to be macroeconomic factors that affect these markets, but in general, we believe we have a strong strategy in place. Our focus now is on continuing to build our brand and expand our reach in these regions.","5079":"We have been closely monitoring user feedback and privacy concerns. As a result, we have been working on several initiatives to address these concerns. [SEP] And then finally, we are rolling out our own product changes such as the recent launch of OSA that's our user control on what data stored on Facebook activity. [SEP] We are confident that our new product changes, including OSA, will help increase user trust in our platform. We remain committed to improving our user experience while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security.","5080":"During the Q&A session, an analyst asked about the company's policies on hate speech and nudity. [SEP] So one of the pieces of criticism that I think we get that I think is fair is we're much better able to enforce our nudity policies, for example, than we are hate speech. [SEP] Our team is working hard to improve our hate speech detection algorithms and we're already seeing some progress in reducing the amount of problematic content on our platform.","5081":"Moving on to our financial outlook, we are revising our guidance for the year based on the current market conditions and foreign exchange exposure. As you know, the global economy has been impacted by changing exchange rates and geopolitical challenges. [SEP] And just if you're looking on a non-FX adjusted basis, the foreign exchange exposure, which I mentioned was $730 million or 250 basis points expected in this guidance. [SEP] However, we have implemented several cost-saving measures and have gained market share in key regions that will help mitigate the impact of these challenges. We remain committed to achieving our growth targets and are confident in our ability to do so.","5082":"Our financial results for the quarter have been very encouraging and we are pleased to report a significant increase in revenues and profits. [SEP] On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 400,000 employees, both full-time and part-time in the U.S. and UK will be getting a substantial wage increase. [SEP] This wage increase is part of our ongoing commitment to invest in and support our employees, who are the backbone of our company. We hope that it will not only improve their quality of life but also enhance their overall job satisfaction and loyalty to the company.","5083":"Can you elaborate on the timeline for achieving network efficiency for a new facility? [SEP] We still say it takes up to three years or three peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility, and that's about the same although the whole network gets sufficient over time. [SEP] However, we have been implementing new technologies and processes that have helped us reach network efficiency faster than in the past.","5084":"Our team has been closely examining the usage trends and patterns of our Messenger platform. [SEP] And so, when we think about the format of Messenger, we think about the direct correspondence between a person, either an existing or a potential client or with a business, and we think there are many times in kind of a life cycle of interacting with a business where that's a very attractive opportunity. [SEP] Additionally, we believe that Messenger has the potential to become a valuable tool for customer service and support, further strengthening our relationships with our clients.","5085":"Our team has evaluated the useful life of our equipment and has determined that it is shorter than previously estimated. [SEP] So, we are going to start depreciating them on a four year basis. [SEP] This change in our depreciation schedule allows us to more accurately reflect the value of our assets on our financial statements.","5086":"During the past quarter, we saw steady growth in our user base and engagement levels. Our advertising revenue also showed strong growth, particularly in the mobile segment. [SEP] We're excited to bring the UEFA Champions League Soccer and College Basketball to Facebook, and we're going to continue to experiment with developing many different forms of content for Facebook. [SEP] We believe that creating original content for Facebook is a key strategy for driving user engagement and increasing revenue. In addition to sports content, we're also exploring opportunities in the areas of news, entertainment, and gaming. We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the coming months.","5087":"As we look ahead to the next quarter, there are a few key metrics we will be keeping a close eye on. [SEP] I don\u2019t -- easier way frankly to think about that Keith is our Q4 gross margin and our Q1 gross margin. [SEP] Of course, we understand that there are many factors that can impact our gross margins in the short-term, but we feel confident that we have a solid strategy in place for the coming months.","5088":"Now I'd like to turn to our Amazon Business segment. [SEP] Amazon business, yes, in April you may remember we launched it as a marketplace with specific features and benefits for businesses. [SEP] Can you give us an update on how it's been performing and any plans for expansion?","5089":"We are very excited about our latest feature on Messenger that allows businesses to connect with their customers in a more seamless way. Our team has worked hard to ensure that these interactions are efficient and effective for all parties involved. [SEP] But in terms of the business, the more important piece is how people can interact with businesses through Messenger. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in usage of this feature, with many businesses reporting higher customer satisfaction and engagement rates. This is a key area of focus for us moving forward, and we will continue to improve and enhance these capabilities to better serve our customers.","5090":"Thank you for joining us on this earnings conference call. As we review our financial performance for the quarter, I am pleased to announce that we exceeded expectations with strong revenue growth. [SEP] And you heard on this call me give a few examples of where we're already able to connect what happens in terms of ads with real sales of real products. [SEP] This connection between ad performance and sales is a powerful tool for our business, and we plan to invest in this area further. We believe that this technology will enable us to better understand and serve our customers, ultimately driving even greater revenue growth in the future. Thank you for your continued support of our company.","5091":"Our user base has seen significant growth over the past year. [SEP] And I think when you look at the value, I think we feel good about the opportunity to continue to move these users including new first-line or frontline users that we've not had access before. [SEP] We will also be exploring options to expand our product offerings to attract new user segments and drive further growth.","5092":"As we discuss our Q3 earnings, I want to take a moment to highlight some exciting developments in our product offerings. [SEP] But in addition to that, I must say there are two other things that are increasingly becoming fairly relevant in the adoption cycle, which is moving to both Office 365 and Windows 10 and getting essentially to this new frontier for productivity, which is an always up-to-date operating system, which is secure, and an always up-to-date Office experience that is a SaaS service. [SEP] We are seeing strong adoption rates for both Office 365 and Windows 10, with many customers recognizing the benefits of a cloud-based, always-updated software suite.","5093":"During this quarter, we experienced increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies. [SEP] We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. [SEP] These changes did result in some temporary disruptions to our operations, but we are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges.","5094":"We have noticed a significant decline in our revenue stream from our Hong Kong subsidiary. [SEP] And our perspective on that is it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the U.S. dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the U.S. dollar. [SEP] However, we are exploring opportunities to hedge our currency exposure in the future to mitigate this risk.","5095":"We've seen a lot of growth in our sales and marketing efforts, and we're excited for the upcoming product launch. [SEP] And to your specific question, Mark, before every launch we tend to have a tightening in the channel as they prepare and run reasonably lean. [SEP] However, we expect the channel to loosen up fairly quickly after the launch and anticipate strong sales throughout the quarter.","5096":"Can you discuss any recent developments or accomplishments in the international markets? [SEP] We've done many things we're the only cloud provider for example that operates in China. [SEP] This has given us a unique advantage in this market, but we still face some challenges with navigating the government regulations.","5097":"We've seen strong growth in Q1 and are excited to share our results with you today. [SEP] So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove. [SEP] As we move forward, we'll continue to focus on delivering value to our customers and driving profitability for our shareholders. \n\nFull statement: \n\n\"We've seen strong growth in Q1 and are excited to share our results with you today. So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove. As we move forward, we'll continue to focus on delivering value to our customers and driving profitability for our shareholders.","5098":"Thank you for that question. [SEP] We do realize it's a period of investment and we're in different stages of growth in different countries. [SEP] However, we remain focused on our long-term strategic goals and are confident in our ability to deliver strong returns to our shareholders in the future.","5099":"Our company has seen tremendous success in the tablet market. In fact, our latest earnings report shows that tablet sales have increased by over 30% year-over-year. [SEP] And so by very high, I mean that if you look in some of the developed market like the U.S., Japan, the UK, you would find that 50% of the people are buying an iPad for the first time. [SEP] This truly demonstrates the growing demand for tablets among consumers. We are excited to continue innovating and improving our tablet offerings to meet this demand and provide the best experience for our customers.","5100":"During this quarter, we faced some challenges with our revenue growth, which impacted our overall financial performance. We understand that this may cause concerns among our shareholders and investors. [SEP] You know it\u2019s going to be hard on revenue growth, it\u2019s going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make or some are faster than others and some have other work to do before they can migrate. [SEP] However, we want to assure you that we remain committed to driving sustainable revenue growth over the long-term. We are taking steps to enhance our sales and marketing efforts, as well as improve our product offerings to better serve our customers. We are confident that these measures will help us overcome the short-term fluctuations and deliver strong financial results in the future.","5101":"Thank you all for joining us today for our earnings call. [SEP] We just passed our Fifth Year Anniversary \u2013 celebrated our Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site in India. [SEP] Our success is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team, and we look forward to continued growth and success in the years to come.","5102":"We have been exploring ways to increase engagement across our platforms. [SEP] That's something we can put in News Feed in Instagram and Messenger and it both grows the ecosystem and creates a new opportunity for interaction. [SEP] Our research shows that users want more opportunities for social interaction within our apps.","5103":"In terms of ad load, we continue to expect in the second half of the year that ad load will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth. We anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months. [SEP] because every time we put an ad in newsfeed, if it\u2019s a video ad, it\u2019s taking a place of an ad with another format. [SEP] As ad load continues to be less important, we are focusing on ad quality and relevance to drive better performance for advertisers. We are also exploring other revenue streams, such as in-stream video ads and sponsored content, to diversify our business.","5104":"Our team has been focused on driving growth and increasing adoption of our Office suite of products. [SEP] And we were able to see that this quarter across all the core workloads in Office. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue as we invest in improving user experiences and expanding our offerings.","5105":"Thank you for your question. We have had a lot of success in our first year of operation, but we recognize that there is still a lot of work to be done to fully realize our potential. [SEP] So, there's always learnings that we have that's why we say it's still day one here. [SEP] We believe that by staying focused on our core values and continuing to innovate, we can build a truly great company. We are excited about the future and look forward to sharing our progress with you in the months and years ahead.","5106":"We have seen strong demand for our new product line. [SEP] And so there is a real benefit right now to being an early adopter, the pricing is very attractive. [SEP] As the product gains traction in the market, we may adjust the pricing accordingly.","5107":"As we expand our fulfillment capabilities, we also incur certain costs that impact our margins. [SEP] And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. [SEP] However, we anticipate that these costs will decrease as the fulfillment center reaches its full capacity.","5108":"We have invested heavily in our AI technology to enhance our products and services. Our goal is to integrate AI into all aspects of our business. [SEP] So over time we may not have to ramp it as much, but I don't foresee any time in the near future that AI is going to make it to that if the cost comes down. [SEP] However, we are always keeping an eye on advancements in technology and will adapt accordingly. At the moment, we believe that the investment in AI will ultimately pay off in the long run and provide significant benefits for both our company and our customers.","5109":"Our company has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence technology for the past year. [SEP] That doesn't mean that the computers will be thinking or be generally better, but that is useful for a number of things. [SEP] This improved efficiency and accuracy will ultimately save our company both time and money.","5110":"Let's take a closer look at our customer metrics. [SEP] On the customer side \u2013 excuse me, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year. [SEP] This significant increase in active customer accounts is a testament to the strength of our marketing and sales efforts, as well as the appeal of our products and services to consumers.","5111":"A question from an analyst asked about the competition between Azure and AWS. [SEP] First of all, I don\u2019t think that of the comparison between Azure and AWS is the true north for me. [SEP] I believe that there are many factors to consider when it comes to choosing a cloud provider, and it's not just about who has the biggest market share.","5112":"We are always looking for ways to improve efficiency in software development. Our team has been exploring ways to reuse code and data across different projects. [SEP] So reuse of code, reuse of data, so you would use some amount if iOS infrastructure and then past consumption. [SEP] This approach reduces the time and resources needed to build new applications and features. By leveraging the iOS infrastructure and past consumption data, we can create better experiences for our users while reducing development costs. We believe this is the right strategy to drive growth and profitability in the long run.","5113":"We're seeing continued momentum across the board in our advertising business, with particularly strong growth in our Instagram ad business. In fact, we're pleased to announce that we've hit a major milestone... [SEP] And as I mentioned, 98 of our top 100 advertisers in Facebook are now advertising on Instagram. [SEP] with 2 million active advertisers on Instagram. That's double the number we had just two years ago. We believe we still have a lot more opportunity to grow this business as we continue to improve our ad products and help businesses of all sizes connect with the right audiences on Instagram.","5114":"Can you give us more details on which products are being offered through the new partnership? [SEP] It's not our entire selection, it's tens of thousands of items that they may need on a daily basis. [SEP] We believe this will greatly benefit our customers by providing them with convenient access to essential items at competitive prices.","5115":"Now, I'd like to talk about some of our recent innovations and experiments. [SEP] We've been running an experiment with mobile financial services in Messenger, and one of the things that we found in the Philippines, for example, is that people can buy access to data plans through Messenger. [SEP] We are excited about the potential this holds for opening up new revenue streams in emerging markets.","5116":"Our revenue for the quarter was $16.9 billion, up 11% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong demand for our advertising products and are constantly working to improve our targeting capabilities. [SEP] We then work on helping them use our ad products and upsell them to our paid ad products as well, and we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram. [SEP] Our focus in the coming quarter will be on expanding these numbers even further and providing even more value to our advertisers. We are also investing heavily in our virtual event capabilities, as we believe this will be a crucial area of growth in the coming years. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.","5117":"We have seen impressive growth in our gaming division this quarter and are excited to announce our plans for the future. [SEP] In other words, we have now increasing past services that we are going to reinforce on Azure and attract more game developers [SEP] Our team has been working diligently to create new and innovative solutions for game developers using Azure. We believe that this investment in our gaming services will fuel further growth in this sector and continue to position us as a leader in the industry.","5118":"We've had some challenges in our sales department this quarter. [SEP] So, I don\u2019t really think of that as being negative, and you saw the exact same behavior and dynamics. [SEP] Overall, we're still confident in our growth strategy moving forward.","5119":"As we continue to expand our services and offerings, we see many of our customers beginning their journey with us in one area and gradually utilizing more of our solutions as their needs grow and evolve. [SEP] I think the Maersk example I walked you through is probably a good one, where it may start with some commodity workload on Azure or it may start with Office 365, but then it will end up with HoloLens and someone using Dynamics 365 for increased automation. [SEP] This is the beauty of our integrated, cloud-based platform - it allows businesses to seamlessly adopt and integrate new tools and technologies as they become necessary for their operations.","5120":"As we move forward into the next quarter, I want to address some concerns about our sales numbers. [SEP] Now over the next period, especially in H1, we continue to see -- expect to see very good hybrid percentage and execution, which help to offset some of that. [SEP] Additionally, our team is working hard to streamline our production processes to further improve efficiency and reduce costs.","5121":"We're now going to take a question from an analyst on the line. [SEP] The biggest focus \u2013 the biggest impact of the focus on meaningful interactions as Mark mentioned will be in areas like passive video, where from a business perspective, we monetize less on a time spent basis. [SEP] So we think with this focus on meaningful interactions, we can actually create a better experience for people who are engaging with passive video, and that will ultimately drive more value and more monetization for us.","5122":"Our focus for the next quarter will be on expanding our video capabilities. [SEP] So there's a big space here in terms of helping people have real connections and interactions around video. [SEP] We've already seen a positive response from users in our initial testing phases and we're excited to continue growing this area of our platform.","5123":"Our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction has driven strong growth in our mobile app usage. [SEP] You can also have Siri call for you, you can send messages, you can get a Uber car or a Lyft car. [SEP] We continue to explore partnerships and integrations with other popular services to expand the convenience and capabilities of our app.","5124":"Our sales team has been making great strides in promoting iPads to businesses and we have seen significant growth in this area. [SEP] I\u2019m a big believer in the ability for iPad to play in a major way in enterprise. [SEP] With the introduction of new features and enhancements, such as multi-tasking and Apple Pencil support, I believe the iPad will continue to be a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes.","5125":"We are pleased to announce that we have exceeded expectations for this quarter. Our team has been working hard to deliver strong results and we are thrilled with the outcome. [SEP] And so our internal goal was to be able to beat the thousand level, and we thought it would be great if we were able to do that by a little bit. [SEP] I am happy to report that we have in fact surpassed our goal and achieved a revenue of $1,200. This is a significant milestone for our company and a testament to the dedication of our employees. Moving forward, we will continue to strive for excellence and look for new opportunities for growth.","5126":"As we continue to see growth in the industry, we've noticed a shift towards hybrid solutions in the manufacturing space. [SEP] And then there is the hybrid choices, where if somebody's building a smart factory, they're now looking and saying, what is the server I deploy in the factory to manage the millions of sensors that are there across the factory. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to develop cutting-edge servers that can seamlessly manage these high volumes of data, leading to increased efficiency and productivity within the smart factory environment.","5127":"Moving on to our social media strategy, I wanted to highlight the impressive growth we've seen on our Instagram account. [SEP] because 90% -- more than 90% of Instagram users are following a business. [SEP] This presents a huge opportunity for us to reach our target audience and drive sales through the platform.","5128":"I'd like to address a question we received about our cloud strategy.\"\n- \"As we continue to shift towards cloud-based solutions, I think it's important to clarify our approach. [SEP] Again Mark this goes back to a little bit of understanding I guess how we think about both X as well as OpEx in terms of our cloud. [SEP] Basically, we see X as a key driver of cloud adoption among our customers.\"\n- \"And when it comes to OpEx, we try to balance cost savings with investments in innovation and scalability.","5129":"Our Q3 earnings report is showing significant growth in several areas, including our advertising revenue. We've been working hard to improve our offerings and create more value for our customers and advertisers. [SEP] Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offering's more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America, although not in the North America segment. [SEP] However, we did see a decrease in advertising revenue in the North America segment due to some unexpected market challenges. We're addressing these challenges and remain optimistic about the growth potential in this region. Overall, we're pleased with the strong performance of our advertising business and will continue to invest in improving our offerings.","5130":"We've received a lot of feedback from our customers about the shopping product.

[SEP] As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories have become wider over time and therefore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past, because we got this much wider sales price dispersion, so unit of sale per se becomes less relevant.

[SEP] So that's proven to be a, I think, a good skill for folks to be able to enjoy in addition to a really kind of rich and growing Amazon skill set. [SEP] We've received a lot of positive feedback from both our employees and customers regarding their experience with these new skills.","5210":"Another area of focus for us has been voice technology. As we continue to innovate and improve our products, we recognize the importance of voice as a key interface for consumers. [SEP] But in all of these different ways, voice and how people interact with each other and eventually building products that allow people to interface with our products through that, we\u2019re quite focused on this. [SEP] Over the past year, we have made significant strides in our voice technology capabilities and we will continue to invest in this area. We believe that voice has the potential to transform the way people interact with technology and we want to be at the forefront of this innovation.","5211":"We've seen incredible demand for our products over the past quarter, particularly for the iPhone and Apple Watch. [SEP] The reverse of that is also true, is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided I really want something to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth like the watch does so well and so it's not always a linear path. [SEP] That's why we continue to innovate and create new products that meet the evolving needs of our customers. We're excited about the upcoming release of the next generation Apple Watch, which will include even more advanced health and fitness features.","5212":"Thank you all for joining us today for our Q4 earnings conference call. I\u2019d like to start by providing an update on our current financial performance. [SEP] And then in Q4, last time on this call I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty. [SEP] Unfortunately, we have received confirmation that we will indeed be facing a $1.5 billion penalty in Q4, primarily due to unexpected regulatory issues. However, we remain confident in our ability to navigate this challenge and continue to deliver value to our stakeholders. I will now turn it over to our CFO for a more detailed financial update.","5213":"We're committed to offering a wide range of products to our customers. [SEP] As long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced competitively. [SEP] We continuously monitor inventory levels and pricing to ensure we're meeting the needs of our customers.","5214":"In terms of our liquidity position, we feel very comfortable about where we stand. [SEP] There is a certain tranche that we can dial up quickly, and we've started to do that and you'll see that very quickly in Q2. [SEP] Our team has been closely monitoring market trends and we are confident in our ability to meet demand with our increased capacity.","5215":"We've seen tremendous growth over the past year and we believe that much of it is due to our investments in digital technology. [SEP] So we're super excited to have the platform and to continue to invest in it. [SEP] We believe that the platform will allow us to further enhance our customers' experience and improve our overall efficiency. We anticipate significant returns on our investment in the coming years.","5216":"Our focus for this quarter has been on increasing the adoption and integration of our Office suite of products. [SEP] In its own right, we think of Office as perhaps one of the most strategic developer assets we have and with the Microsoft Graph API and what we see as activity around it, we think about the platform effects of that as also being very key. [SEP] We're already seeing great results in terms of increased developer engagement and customer satisfaction.","5217":"We've seen significant growth in our Azure business over the past year and we expect, given the trends we're seeing and our ongoing investments, that growth to continue into the future. [SEP] So we see the combination and they're not all happening coincident, but there is time lag in it but therefore that\u2019s one of the reasons why we want to be very aggressive in getting the workloads on to Azure both storage and compute; and even in the storage and compute, we now have premium offerings for higher SLA, for higher performance, higher VM sizes and then on top of that, we have these managed services which have a different margin profile. [SEP] As we continue to expand our offerings and improve our margins in this area, we believe Azure will be a key driver of our overall business growth. We're confident in our ability to continue to innovate and meet the needs of our customers in this ever-evolving landscape.","5218":"Thank you for the question. Now turning to our cloud services business [SEP] And in the case of AT&T we were the only public cloud in there. [SEP] Our strong performance in this segment is a testament to the value we bring to our customers and our ability to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive market.","5219":"We're still working on the specifics of our plan to continue growing our company. [SEP] But I can't tell you just yet what that timeframe is going to look like, but I think we're well-positioned over the long-term because we're leading in Stories in basically every country. [SEP] Our focus now is on making sure we maintain our leadership position and keep innovating to improve the Stories experience for our users.","5220":"Now let's shift our attention to the potential growth opportunities in our energy sector. [SEP] I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on. [SEP] We will continue to explore and invest in these assets to drive long-term value for our shareholders.","5221":"We've made significant investments in our cloud infrastructure over the past year, and I want to talk about how that's impacting our business. [SEP] So that\u2019s why utilization of that entire infrastructure is how we think about even total return on invested capital for our cloud business. [SEP] We're seeing great results from the investments we've made in our cloud infrastructure, and we expect this to continue to drive growth for our business in the coming year.","5222":"In terms of our earnings performance, things are shaping up well. We saw solid revenue growth across all business segments, and we\u2019re making good progress on cost management initiatives. [SEP] On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. [SEP] However, we\u2019re closely monitoring the effects of the ongoing trade tensions and potential further currency fluctuations. We\u2019re also exploring opportunities to expand into new markets to mitigate any potential impacts on our earnings.","5223":"Can you talk a bit more about the pricing strategy for our products? [SEP] There will always be somebody who chooses to purchase on a one-time basis, or there's a logic to it [SEP] But overall, we are really focused on building a loyal customer base through our subscription model.\" \n\n\"I think it's important to recognize that there will always be somebody who chooses to purchase on a one-time basis, or there's a logic to it,\" the CEO explained. \"Perhaps they just need the product for a specific event or occasion. However, our goal is to encourage customers to sign up for our subscription service, which not only provides them with convenience and cost savings but also ensures repeat business for us.","5224":"Thank you for joining our earnings call today. We are pleased to report our Q1 results. [SEP] First, the top-line growth was \u2013 continued to be strong coming out of Q4. [SEP] Our revenue increased by 10% compared to the same period last year, driven by strong performance in our core business and new product launches. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth for the remainder of the year.","5225":"We are constantly evaluating our performance and looking for ways to improve our offerings to advertisers. [SEP] Our goal is to give marketers the highest return they can and over time to capture the amount of budget that's equivalent to the percentage of media time we capture and we're not there. [SEP] We have identified certain areas where we need to improve, such as targeting capabilities and measurement tools, and are investing heavily in these areas to better serve our clients.","5226":"The technology landscape is constantly evolving, and we are continuously exploring new ways to improve our offerings and increase our efficiency. [SEP] I even referenced in my remarks how in healthcare people are using those to build bots and skills and agents. [SEP] I believe this will be a critical area for growth and innovation in the coming years.","5227":"We've received a lot of positive feedback from customers about our new platform. [SEP] I think it's the direction that we should be going in with more things in the future. [SEP] Our research and development team is already working on expanding our capabilities in this area.","5228":"Our company has always been committed to creating a safe and responsible online environment for our users. [SEP] And we see a lot of that online and that's a pretty big issue from everything from bullying to terrorism, there are lots of reasons why people might otherwise have the tools to share what they would want but feel silenced. [SEP] That's why we've invested heavily in technology that can identify and flag content that violates our community guidelines, and why we continue to work closely with law enforcement to combat harmful behavior.","5229":"We've seen a significant increase in user engagement and satisfaction over the past quarter. [SEP] And so all these things, all these things together are all about the user experience and making people's daily lives better. [SEP] We'll continue to invest in product development and research to ensure that our users have the best possible experience.","5230":"We're very excited about the potential of our latest product releases including the new iPhone and Apple Watch. [SEP] And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience. [SEP] In addition to our hardware offerings, we're also continuing to invest in our software and services, such as Apple Music and iCloud, to provide a seamless user experience across all devices.","5231":"We've received a lot of questions about the ongoing legal battles surrounding patent infringement between our company and some of our competitors. I'd like to take a moment to address this issue. [SEP] And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. [SEP] We'll continue to work closely with regulators and take all necessary measures to protect our intellectual property. But at the end of the day, what really matters to us is delivering the best possible product to our consumers.","5232":"Moving on to our financial performance, our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.78, which is in line with our guidance. [SEP] This is about $1.1 billion of negative foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. [SEP] However, we were able to offset some of this impact through our cost reduction initiatives and strong sales growth in certain regions.","5233":"Thanks, operator. Next question. [SEP] And then, Anthony, just real quick, this is Dave, on your question around media and probably more particularly the video strategy and what we're investing in, I mean, we are continuing to invest meaningfully in digital video. [SEP] We've seen great success with our recent partnerships and we're excited to see how our investments will continue to drive growth.","5234":"Our financial results for this quarter have exceeded our expectations and we're thrilled with the progress we've made. [SEP] because if you look at what we do, is we spend our capital only to really fuel the growth or to service the growth of usage across Office 365 and Azure, and you see that increasing [SEP] Our commitment to investing in the growth of our platforms has allowed us to provide our customers with the best possible experience and we plan to continue this strategy moving forward.","5235":"With regards to our sales strategy, we've been focused on transitioning towards more complex sales opportunities. This has required a shift in our approach and a greater emphasis on understanding our customers' needs. [SEP] And I think the way we've seen this in the field is -- and our sales organization has been not unlike some of these Dynamics transactions or the Power platform transactions that require a fundamental understanding of business process and the changes you're trying to implement. [SEP] To support this shift, we've invested heavily in our sales training programs and have seen great results. Our sales teams now have a deeper understanding of our customers' businesses and are able to present solutions that are tailored to their specific challenges. We believe that this approach will continue to drive growth for our business in the years to come.","5236":"We've had a lot of success with our Marketplace feature on Facebook, which has seen significant growth over the past year. [SEP] So one example is a lot of people, hundreds of millions of people, are using Marketplace on Facebook now, and a lot of people are using that in countries where WhatsApp is the primary messaging app that they use. [SEP] This presents some exciting opportunities for cross-platform integration and potential partnerships between WhatsApp and Marketplace in the future.","5237":"Our quarterly report shows a significant increase in revenue in all of our main business sectors. We also continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth. [SEP] We're seeing strong usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual increased pace of enterprise migrations. [SEP] We believe that the increased pace of enterprise migrations will continue to fuel our usage growth in the coming quarters. While this may lead to some short-term revenue challenges, we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth over the long term.","5238":"We have now come to the end of the Q&A session. Do we have any last questions for our CEO? [SEP] On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, as you know for us, will always be the product and the experience. [SEP] And we believe that if we focus on making the best possible product and enriching the user experience, we will continue to attract and retain customers.","5239":"Now turning to our performance in the past quarter [SEP] So yes, continue to see growth in programs for both sellers -- for our sellers and delivery partners. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to maintain this growth trajectory in the coming months.","5240":"We've just launched a new marketing campaign last week. [SEP] And so it's really too early to tell what the conversion rate will be. [SEP] However, initial data suggests that there has been a significant increase in website traffic and engagement since the launch.","5241":"Moving onto our financial performance for the quarter, I'd like to first highlight our gross margin. [SEP] As you know, we typically have what we call product transition costs during the September quarter, and this year we also have about 30 bps of headwind from foreign exchange again because the dollar has appreciated recently. [SEP] However, we expect these costs and headwinds to be temporary and anticipate improved margins in the upcoming quarters.","5242":"We've been very focused on improving our risk management processes over the past year. [SEP] We're judging our success by how proactive can we get, so what percent of the stuff that we're taking down are we identifying before other people identify it for us. [SEP] We've seen great progress in this area and have been able to identify and address potential issues before they turn into bigger problems.","5243":"We have seen a lot of growth in our customer base over the past year. [SEP] So the fact that we were able to grow in that low expiry base is actually very good structural performance. [SEP] Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue this growth trajectory and build on our strong structural performance.","5244":"Moving on to our digital media segment, I'm pleased to report strong growth in video content and marketing initiatives. [SEP] First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year. [SEP] This growth is being driven by our expanded partnerships with major networks and increased investment in original content production.","5245":"Thank you for your questions. As we wrap up this earnings conference call, let's address any remaining concerns. [SEP] But to your second question I\u2019ll even say the following which is that, I think that there is clearly difference in GM between the per user and consumption. [SEP] This is why we are focused on maximizing our engagement metrics, such as time spent on our platform and the number of active users. We believe that by improving these metrics, we can increase the value of our platform to advertisers and continue to grow our revenue. Thank you for your questions and for joining us on this call today.","5246":"Our focus continues to be on driving growth and profitability. [SEP] And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. [SEP] This is a positive trend that reflects the strength of our brand and the effectiveness of our sales strategy.","5247":"Now we'll open up to questions from the investors. [SEP] So I do feel good about how we're doing, but it needs to do a lot more obviously and we're very excited about the roadmap of things that we have ahead. [SEP] Our goal is to continue to innovate and provide value to our customers, while also driving profitability for our shareholders.","5248":"In terms of expansion, our company has been looking into various markets for potential growth opportunities. [SEP] And so we'll see how this area goes, but it is still an area of great interest. [SEP] We will continue to monitor the market and keep a close eye on any developments that may arise.","5249":"We had a few questions about our financial statements from analysts earlier, so I wanted to take a moment to address some of those. [SEP] So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with \u2013 on investments. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and remain confident in our long-term strategy moving forward.","5250":"When it comes to expanding our organic and sustainable product offerings, we are always looking for partners whose values align with ours. [SEP] I think that Whole Foods really gives us a vast headstart on that and a great base. [SEP] We plan to continue building upon the foundation that Whole Foods has provided us and hope to work with more companies that share our commitment to ethical and environmentally conscious practices.","5251":"We've seen tremendous growth in our Echo and Alexa sales this quarter. [SEP] We're really glad to see that and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there. [SEP] This fan base will be key in driving future sales and growth for our company.","5252":"Our launch in Australia has been a huge success. [SEP] And I'm told we had several hundred people waiting at the store in Sydney and I'm getting similar reports from across that region. [SEP] We're thrilled with the initial response and excited to continue expanding our brand in the Asia-Pacific region.","5253":"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO for some remarks on our recent fiscal quarter. [SEP] That said, we're really excited about the opportunity I talked about, increasing the entertainment and media vertical and brand marketers, particularly. [SEP] We've been working hard to expand our reach in this market segment and have already seen some positive results. Our team is dedicated to delivering high-quality content and innovative marketing solutions that will help us capture even more market share. So overall, we're very bullish on this initiative and look forward to sharing more updates with you in the coming quarters.","5254":"Our team has been working diligently to execute our growth strategy and we are pleased with the results we have seen thus far. In particular, we have experienced strong growth in our North American market. [SEP] We had a meaningful step up in North America in Q2 and it was accelerating through the quarter. [SEP] We believe this trend will continue in the second half of the year as we ramp up our marketing efforts and further leverage our partnerships in the region. In addition, we are exploring new product lines and services that we believe will further accelerate our growth in North America and beyond. Overall, we are very optimistic about our prospects for the future.","5255":"Our focus has always been on building strong relationships with our customers. [SEP] Because those of a long-term contracts relationships we want to have with our customers be it consumer, be it small business or large customers. [SEP] This approach has ensured a reliable revenue stream for us over the years.","5256":"We continue to see strong performance in our advertising revenue, particularly in our domestic market. We have implemented new strategies to increase our share in the global advertising market. [SEP] I would also say that, although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally. [SEP] We are optimistic about the potential for revenue growth in international markets and will invest accordingly. In addition to advertising, we are seeing growth in other areas such as subscription services and e-commerce. We will continue to adapt and innovate to stay ahead of industry trends.","5257":"We've had a strong quarter and we've achieved some significant milestones, but we're not resting on our laurels. We're focusing on what we can do to continue our growth trajectory for the rest of the year and beyond. [SEP] And the pilots, the place which in the second half is going to be a huge focus for us is the enterprise deployment, and that's where I think there's real excitement [SEP] Our enterprise deployment efforts will be a key component of this strategy, and we're working hard to make sure we hit the ground running. We believe there's significant potential in this area, and we're excited to see the results of our efforts in the coming months.","5258":"One of the things we've been focusing on is our product innovation. We continue to invest in our R&D to make sure we have the best technology in the market. [SEP] And our ability to blend them into interesting products that solve customer solutions, which may not even be priced as the component parts, is I think how we think about, especially in our solution areas that Satya talks about, how we talk about delivering it to a customer. [SEP] We've also been looking at ways to streamline our supply chain so we can deliver products faster and more efficiently. Our goal is to make sure we can meet the needs of our customers in a timely manner. Overall, we're confident that our approach to product development and delivery will continue to drive growth in the coming year.","5259":"Our next question comes from the line of [Analyst Name] from [Investment Firm Name]. [SEP] And then I'd say across all of our apps, we're seeing strong adoption of Stories and, on WhatsApp Status products around the world, and that continues to provide another way for people to connect and share. [SEP] Do you see any specific regions or demographics driving the growth in Stories and Status?","5260":"Now let's turn to our Q4 earnings results. [SEP] If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter in Q4, we felt very good about cloud demand across all three services, but in particular with Azure. [SEP] We believe this trend will continue into 2021 as more businesses prioritize digital transformation and remote work solutions.","5261":"We have some updates regarding our financial reporting. As many of you know, we have recently adopted ASC 606, which is a new revenue recognition standard. [SEP] The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of ASC 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM. [SEP] However, it's important to note that ASC 606 will impact our overall revenue recognition and financial reporting beyond just Windows OEM. Specifically, we expect changes in how we recognize revenue from our cloud offerings and other subscription-based products. We will continue to evaluate and communicate these changes as they occur.","5262":"Our team has been working hard to improve our content moderation policies and processes. [SEP] It helps us identify content that might be offensive or graphic that might violate the policies of Facebook so we can flag that and review that better. [SEP] We have also invested in AI technology that is able to detect harmful content before it is even reported by users.","5263":"We acknowledge that there has been a decline in user engagement and trust in our platform. This is largely in response to the various controversies that have plagued our company in recent years. [SEP] And therefore over time the community feels less comfortable sharing that kind of content on Facebook. [SEP] We are working tirelessly to regain the trust and confidence of our users. We have implemented various measures to curb misinformation and hate speech, and we will continue to invest in these efforts moving forward.","5264":"Our strategy for our digital media division has been focused on expansion into new markets. [SEP] So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. [SEP] We believe this will position us well for continued growth and profitability in the years to come.","5265":"We've seen some questions from investors about our revenue recognition process, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify. [SEP] And then there are transactions, like for example, App Store sales, where a portion of the transaction does not get recognized by Apple, but it goes to the developer. [SEP] This is because we only recognize revenue for the portion of the transaction that represents our fee for facilitating the sale.","5266":"In response to a question about Instagram's e-commerce capabilities, the CEO of the company explains how they see potential in making shopping more seamless on the platform. [SEP] So when you think about the shopping experience or the checkout experience on Instagram, these are still very early days, and we're working hard to improve the product and expand to more businesses. [SEP] The CEO also notes that the company is constantly soliciting feedback from businesses and users to improve the shopping experience on Instagram. Additionally, they are exploring new ways to integrate payment and shopping features into the platform to make it easier for businesses to sell products directly to customers.","5267":"We have seen strong demand for our products during this quarter, especially for the iPhone line. [SEP] You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward. [SEP] Our focus remains on delivering exceptional experiences to our customers and continuing to innovate in the market.","5268":"Thank you for taking my question. \n2. I wanted to follow up on the video tab that was announced last quarter. [SEP] So, Anthony, I can just take the first part of that at least, which is \u2013 look, our focus is on kick-starting the ecosystem here for the video tab that Mark talked about. [SEP] Can you provide more detail on the steps you're taking to achieve that goal? \n2. Additionally, how do you plan on leveraging your existing partnerships to support this initiative? \n3. Thank you for your time on this call today.","5269":"We're now moving onto our plans for the rest of the year. [SEP] In terms of the next leg of this, given the momentum that we're seeing across the board, we feel great about our current services, but obviously we're also thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it as well. [SEP] We'll be sharing more updates on these new services as we near their launch dates.","5270":"We have seen strong growth in our user base and engagement metrics, which has translated into increased revenue and profits. Our advertising business continues to perform well, particularly with our focus on mobile-first approaches. [SEP] Then you can start thinking about Messenger and some of the other platforms we have. [SEP] We are also exploring new opportunities in the emerging markets, where we see significant potential for growth. Our investments in artificial intelligence and virtual reality are progressing well, and we anticipate that they will become increasingly important to our business in the coming years.","5271":"Thank you for the question, next question please. [SEP] Yes, I think that's a fair interpretation of my commentary both last year and this, which really speaks to consistency. [SEP] And I believe consistency is a key factor in building trust with our investors and stakeholders.","5272":"We\u2019ve seen a significant trend towards mobile usage over the last few years, which has coincided with a shift in consumer behavior. [SEP] In terms of monetizing time spent, it\u2019s certainly the case that consumers have shifted to mobile and businesses need to catch up. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to develop new strategies for mobile advertising to ensure that our clients can effectively reach their target audience on mobile devices.","5273":"We remain committed to our mission of providing the best possible service to our customers. [SEP] But when you're running an operation and serving people at this scale, I think you have a responsibility to invest in all these things that are downstream that could help shape and improve people's lives, because I don't think that there are that many other folks in the world who will. [SEP] That's why we've made significant investments in things like renewable energy, social initiatives, and community programs.","5274":"We are constantly exploring ways to improve our efficiency and effectiveness in moderating content within our platform. [SEP] AI tools over time will be able to do a better job of flagging things for the set of people who are in the Community Ops teams that we can prioritize what we look at. [SEP] This is just one example of how we are utilizing technology to support our Community Ops teams and ensure that we are providing a safe and welcoming environment for our users. As we continue to invest in AI tools, we believe we will see even more opportunities to enhance our moderation efforts.","5275":"During the past quarter, we have seen a significant increase in our revenue compared to the same period last year. [SEP] We had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada, so that was part of the growth. [SEP] Additionally, our team has been working hard on expanding our product line and entering new markets, which has contributed to our overall growth.","5276":"During this quarter, we have been focused on driving revenue growth and improving our profitability. One of the primary ways we aim to achieve this is through improving the fees charged to our sellers. [SEP] So we will always be evolving that, part of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes, adding new fees or subtracting old ones, part of it involves raising or lowering fees that sellers pay. [SEP] Our research and analysis indicate that changes to our fee structures have been well-received by our seller community. We will continue to monitor feedback and adjust our fees as needed to ensure a competitive and sustainable marketplace. Ultimately, we are committed to providing our sellers with a low-cost, high-value platform that meets their evolving needs.","5277":"Thank you for joining us for our earnings conference call. Today we're going to be discussing our financial results for the quarter and also providing some updates on our business strategies going forward. [SEP] I mean that is absolutely the fact, case, that is we are seeing a much faster adoption cycle, obviously starting with the consumer side but even the 8 million business PCs that are already running Windows 10 before we have started in fact the push on enterprise. [SEP] This rapid adoption of Windows 10 gives us confidence that our strategy of focusing on cloud-enabled devices and services is the right one. We believe that as more and more businesses move to Windows 10 and embrace cloud computing, we'll see strong growth in our Azure and Office products as well. Overall, we're very pleased with the progress we've made and excited about the opportunities ahead.","5278":"While the past year has been challenging, we are pleased with the progress we have made as a company. [SEP] So over the very long run, I think we remain very optimistic about the growth opportunities we have. [SEP] As we look to the future, we plan to continue investing in research and development to stay at the forefront of our industry.","5279":"Our investments in infrastructure and technology have been key to our growth. [SEP] CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014 and grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. [SEP] We anticipate continued robust CapEx spending in the coming year as we pursue strategic initiatives to support our long-term goals.","5280":"Now, turning to our content strategy, I'd like to discuss some of the exciting developments we have in the pipeline. As you all know, content is at the core of our business and we remain committed to delivering the best possible experience for our users. [SEP] So in terms of news and different kinds of content, I know this has traditionally been something that we've delivered a really good experience for in terms of people being able to share the content that they want, being able to get access to the content that they want, different recommendations from friends, and we've a lot more coming there, including some new updates to our recommendation algorithm that we believe will really help surface the content that people are most interested in. But beyond just the content itself, we're also focusing on ways to enhance the overall viewing experience for our users. [SEP] We're investing heavily in improving our user interface, making it easier for people to find the content they love. We're also testing new interactive features, which we believe will make watching videos on our platform even more engaging. Overall, we're confident that these initiatives will help us increase viewer engagement and ultimately drive revenue growth.","5281":"Our user base has continued to grow steadily over the past quarter, with more and more people turning to our platform for their entertainment needs. [SEP] And the fact that so much video is being consumed on our platform gives us room for an ads business to grow [SEP] We're also exploring additional revenue streams, such as partnerships with content creators and sponsored content, to further expand our ad business.","5282":"In terms of our sales, we saw a strong start to the year in Q1. [SEP] We had some \u2013we think some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year. [SEP] However, we anticipate that the impact of the pre-buys will subside in the upcoming quarters.","5283":"Thank you for the question. Moving on to our projections for the upcoming year. [SEP] So in terms of the deceleration, we continue to expect deceleration into 2020, but it would be, we believe, more moderated and the reasons for that, that we expect the deceleration. [SEP] Overall, we remain confident in our ability to navigate any further deceleration and continue to drive growth in our core businesses.","5284":"We've had a strong quarter and are looking forward to capitalizing on our momentum as we move into the second half of the year. [SEP] We are excited to have acquired the Sizmek ad server and then Sizmek's dynamic creative optimization or DCO. [SEP] This acquisition will allow us to provide our clients with even more powerful advertising solutions and further strengthen our position as a leading player in the industry. We are confident that our expanded capabilities will help us continue to deliver strong financial results in the months ahead.","5285":"In response to a question about the company's plans for LinkedIn. [SEP] So that's really our strategy with LinkedIn as the professional network meeting the professional cloud. [SEP] We believe this approach will create significant value for our customers while differentiating Microsoft from our competitors in the enterprise cloud market.","5286":"We've been closely monitoring our key performance indicators and have seen some positive trends this quarter. [SEP] The entire impact in that KPI, I actually feel very good about that number [SEP] And based on our projections for next quarter, we anticipate even further growth in that area.","5287":"Our inventory management strategy has been a key driver of our success over the past few quarters. By carefully analyzing customer demand and our own supply chain capabilities, we've been able to increase our inventory levels while avoiding excess stock and markdowns. [SEP] And we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and to continue to grow inventory in that way. [SEP] Of course, the global supply chain disruptions we're seeing due to Covid-19 are a challenge to our inventory management efforts. We're working closely with our suppliers and logistics partners to mitigate these challenges and ensure we can continue to deliver high-quality products to our customers. Despite these challenges, we remain optimistic about our ability to grow our inventory and serve our customers' needs.","5288":"Our company is committed to staying ahead of the competition and providing the best possible experience for our users. [SEP] And we've spent a lot of time on this call talking about putting video first. [SEP] By focusing on video content, we believe we can differentiate ourselves and continue to grow our user base.","5289":"We are excited to share with you our plans for the future of our company. As we continue to grow and evolve, we are focused on providing the best possible experiences for our users. [SEP] And a lot of what we're trying to do is enable a number of those things through Facebook, while also building unique world-class services to enable people to share all the things they care about with all the different sets of people that they care about. [SEP] We believe that our strategy of building a strong, interconnected ecosystem of products and services is the key to our success. Our teams are working tirelessly to innovate and create new solutions that will make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.

[SEP] We're seeing investment, we're investing in the audience network and we think it's important [SEP] The audience network has shown promising results in reaching new audiences and increasing engagement with our content.","5291":"During the quarter, we focused heavily on the development of our newest product that we believe will revolutionize the market. [SEP] We\u2019re really excited to get into customers\u2019 hands, so more to come there. [SEP] Additionally, our team has been working around the clock to ensure that this product meets all of our high standards before its launch date.","5292":"I just wanted to touch on our advertising strategy for a moment. [SEP] Really one thing to kind of think about here is that improving the quality and the relevance of the ads has enabled us to show more of them and without harming the experience, and our focus really remains on the experience. [SEP] We understand that user experience is critical to our success, and we are constantly evaluating and tweaking our methods to ensure that we strike the right balance between advertising and user experience.","5293":"Now, let's turn to our mobile gaming business. [SEP] Minecraft on mobile we just launched in fact in the last quarter in China. [SEP] We're pleased to report that Minecraft on mobile experienced strong user growth and is generating significant revenue.","5294":"Let's take a look at our iPhone sales over the past year. As you all know, our iPhone sales faced significant challenges due to COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions. [SEP] You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. [SEP] However, we are proud to report that we have successfully navigated these challenges and continue to see strong demand for our iPhone products. In fact, our Q4 iPhone sales exceeded our expectations, thanks in part to the strategic decision we made to increase iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago.","5295":"We've had some challenges in the past few months that have impacted our revenue and growth. [SEP] And so those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue. [SEP] However, we have identified the root causes and are taking steps to address them, including implementing new strategies and enhancing our products.","5296":"Can you speak to your strategy for monetizing Messenger and any progress you've made so far? [SEP] Our approach to monetization anywhere is always very cautious and we are very - moving very slowly on Messenger, where we remain primarily focused on consumer growth and engagement. [SEP] But can you give us any indication of when we might see more monetization efforts on Messenger?","5297":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in user engagement on our platform. [SEP] And so some of the tools we've rolled out that I talked about where we can take your Facebook pictures and your posts and make it a story, that makes that process faster. [SEP] Additionally, we've been working on improving our ad targeting capabilities to better serve our advertisers and provide a more personalized experience for our users.","5298":"One area that has been challenging for us is our iPod and accessories category. [SEP] Obviously iPod is a part of that, but there are other things in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking. [SEP] As we continue to focus on other product categories and invest in new initiatives, we anticipate that this trend will likely continue.","5299":"As we delve deeper into our market research, we've discovered that there's a significant shift in customer preferences towards digital tools and solutions. [SEP] And we think that we need to build up a lot of different muscles in order to be competitive and be able to succeed in that space and to be able to shape that space. [SEP] That's why we've decided to invest heavily in research and development, partnerships, and acquisitions to bolster our capabilities in that area.","5300":"Our team has been analyzing data from user behavior and market trends to project our take rate. [SEP] So we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is going to be. [SEP] Of course, external factors such as competition and economic conditions can impact these assumptions, so we constantly monitor these variables.","5301":"Our Q1 earnings have exceeded expectations, and we are confident in our strategy moving forward. [SEP] You can see from the March guidance that we\u2019ve given, that we are incredibly bullish about iPhone going forward. [SEP] In addition to the success of iPhone, we are also excited about the growth potential of our services and wearables businesses.","5302":"One of our key focus areas this quarter was our cloud services offerings. We have seen continued strong demand for our Azure platform and we are extremely pleased with the growth we have seen in this business line. [SEP] We are seeing adoption in the building of new front ends, back ends for new front ends, so essentially using Azure as the cloud back end for their mobile apps across Android, iOS, and Windows as well as their web. [SEP] This trend is particularly strong among small and medium-sized businesses, who are increasingly turning to cloud-based solutions to innovate and compete with larger organizations. We expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters, and we remain committed to investing in our cloud services to meet this growing demand.","5303":"We take user privacy very seriously, which is why we have been working on improving our end-to-end encryption system. [SEP] Because there are really important safety and content issues in messaging and if we don\u2019t have the ability to see the content, we need to make sure we have different tools in place to handle that. [SEP] Our team is constantly reviewing and updating our safety protocols to ensure that our messaging platform remains a safe and secure form of communication for all of our users.","5304":"We had a strong quarter and are pleased with the progress we've made. Our revenue growth exceeded expectations and our customer base continues to expand. [SEP] But we're focused on continuing to invest heavily in the business across our near, mid and long-term opportunities and we see a bunch of great opportunities to invest there. [SEP] In the near term, we plan to build out our marketing team to better reach our target audience. In the mid-term, we're looking at expanding into new geographic markets. And in the long-term, we're exploring potential acquisitions to enhance our product offerings and capabilities.","5305":"Our marketing team has been exploring new ways to reach new audiences and increase brand awareness. [SEP] They ran a video ad campaign across Facebook and Instagram Stories and they targeted people with dog-related interests and used Custom Audiences to exclude people who had already purchased their product. [SEP] The campaign resulted in a 25% increase in website traffic and a 15% increase in sales compared to the same period last year.","5306":"We've received a lot of questions about the changes we're making to our platform. I want to address some of those concerns now. [SEP] I think what you're asking is specifically for a transactional component when the old transactional component has gone. [SEP] We understand that some of our customers relied heavily on the previous transactional component, and we want to assure you that we are working on a solution. We're exploring new options and hope to have a new transactional component up and running soon. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate this transition period.","5307":"Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about bundling these different products and services together for customers?\"\n- \"I'm curious about your strategy for integrating these different offerings into a cohesive platform. [SEP] We think about it in the combination of Office 365, Dynamics, EMS, because really it's one cloud infrastructure first of all from a capital perspective that sort of serves all of these and there's a virtuous cycle between all of these for our customers as well. [SEP] So it sounds like the idea is to create this kind of ecosystem where customers can access everything they need from one cloud-based infrastructure. Is that right?\"\n- \"I can definitely see how bundling these services together could create more value for customers. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this.","5308":"Our latest research shows that there has been a significant increase in the number of people accessing our online services over the past quarter. [SEP] And the research there is very clear that when people are using the Internet, and including our services, to interact with other people, that's associated with all the positive elements of well-being that you'd expect: feeling more connected, feeling less lonely, feeling happier, and long-term measures of health but when you're simply using the Internet to passively consume content that isn't necessarily associated with positive improvements to well-being. [SEP] We are constantly striving to improve the user experience on our platform, ensuring that our users are engaged in meaningful interactions with others and are not just passively scrolling through content.","5309":"Investor: Can you speak to the sustainability of the company's growth?\n\nResponse: Sure, I can address that. [SEP] But I would say in terms of sustainability are quarter to quarter, Satya is right. [SEP] Response: Our focus has always been on long-term growth and building a strong foundation for the future. While there may be fluctuations from quarter to quarter, we believe we are on the right track for sustained success. \nInvestor: Thank you for the clarification.","5310":"We appreciate the question about our partnerships, and I'm happy to provide an update on our progress in that area. [SEP] And so we're happy with all the partners we have and continue to work with them to provide the best experience possible. [SEP] As we look ahead, we're excited about the potential for new partnerships and collaborations that can help us grow our business even further.","5311":"We've received questions from investors about our outlook for the upcoming quarters. [SEP] But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continue to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change outside of that component we discussed. [SEP] However, we do anticipate some headwinds in the next quarter due to increased competition in the market.","5312":"We have our next question from the line of John Smith. [SEP] So that's where if you think about the thing that Amy and I focus a lot on is the capital efficiency end-to-end in that context versus getting caught up in even the capital efficiency as measured by any one of these individual pieces, because we think that's what Microsoft's uniqueness long term lies. [SEP] Thank you for your question John, I hope that helps answer your concerns about our approach to capital efficiency.","5313":"Our company strives to understand the ever-changing movement of people in order to provide the best possible products and services. [SEP] People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. [SEP] In response to this trend, we are developing new transportation solutions such as ride-sharing and electric bikes to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","5314":"Our mobile app development platform has been an area of significant focus for us this quarter. [SEP] That's where we have pretty unparalleled value, which is we have Visual Studio Online and some of the tools I talked about, so you can generate these apps at a low cost of ownership, manage them, secure them, and deploy them to our phone endpoints, and then of course, management and security. [SEP] We're seeing great traction with our customers who are looking to quickly and efficiently deploy customized apps to their employees.\"\n\n\"So not only are we offering end-to-end app development capabilities, but we're also providing a comprehensive suite of management and security tools to ensure that our customers can easily maintain and protect their app ecosystem,\" added the CEO.","5315":"Now let's move on to our customer acquisition efforts. [SEP] We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw, our highest ever recorded. [SEP] This is a solid reflection of our marketing strategy and product offerings.","5316":"We are thrilled to report another strong quarter of growth in our commercial business. [SEP] The opportunity for us across what the cloud makes possible for our commercial business and this moment in time that I am a believer in of where companies are going to change their businesses to rely more deeply on technology than they ever have. [SEP] Our team is working hard to capitalize on this trend and ensure that we are well-positioned to provide our customers with the most advanced cloud solutions in the market.","5317":"Our overall revenue for this quarter was $1.5 billion, which is a 5% increase from the same period last year. [SEP] So that clearly is having an impact in APAC and India was our strongest growth market. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the growth potential in these markets and are investing in expanding our operations and workforce to support this growth.","5318":"We're really excited about the potential for our new gaming platform. [SEP] I mean there are a lot of communities that can get that -- people who really care about gaming. [SEP] And with our targeted marketing campaigns, we're confident we can reach these communities and see significant growth in our user base.","5319":"We've seen tremendous growth in our cloud services division. [SEP] And in the last year, we just added more focus and we put more selling capacity around it, more marketing capacity, and now for the mainstream that's across Microsoft [SEP] Our strategy has paid off as we've seen a significant increase in revenue from these efforts.","5320":"We can now take questions from our investors on the earnings call. [SEP] And just to add quickly, I mean, Stories on Facebook is growing quickly. [SEP] Our advertising revenue has also seen steady growth this quarter.","5321":"Our main goal is to prioritize the privacy and security of our users above all else. As part of our efforts to make our messaging platform more secure and reliable, we have made significant investments in our infrastructure. [SEP] We want to make it so that the infrastructure that these services are built on is the most secure and most reliable and fastest and most widely available of any of the major messaging platforms out there, we think that that\u2019s the foundation to build a successful private platform on. [SEP] We are also exploring ways to improve the user experience by incorporating new features and functionalities. We are confident that these initiatives will help us achieve our goal of becoming the leading private messaging platform in the market. Ultimately, we believe that our commitment to security, reliability, and innovation will allow us to deliver significant value to our shareholders and customers.","5322":"We've continued to see strong growth in our cloud business, particularly with Azure. Azure revenue grew 62% year-over-year in the quarter, driving the overall growth in our Intelligent Cloud segment. [SEP] And it turns out that we have ISVs in many cases driving new applications on top of Azure. [SEP] These new applications range from healthcare to financial services to retail. ISVs are drawn to Azure because of its flexibility, security, and scalability. We're thrilled to see the innovation and growth that our ISV partners are driving on our platform.","5323":"Can you give us an update on your latest product releases? [SEP] As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability. [SEP] How has the market responded to this new feature?","5324":"In terms of measuring user engagement and satisfaction on our platform, we use a variety of methods. One of the key ways we assess this is through surveys and feedback from our users. [SEP] We also do a lot of qualitative surveys to see what people, what makes \u2013 what people write in that they want to see from us, what people tell us is the most important thing that they saw in Facebook today or saw anywhere in the world today and what they would've wanted to have seen on Facebook. [SEP] This helps us understand what types of content and features are most valuable to our users, and enables us to make informed decisions about how to enhance the user experience on Facebook. From these surveys, we have discovered a number of key insights that have informed our product development strategy over time. We remain committed to soliciting feedback from our users regularly and using that feedback to further improve our platform.","5325":"We have developed a strategic plan for growth in the next fiscal year. [SEP] We will raise debt both in the U.S. and outside of the United States. [SEP] This will allow us to invest more in research and development for innovative products.","5326":"Our company has been adapting to the changes in the market to remain competitive. [SEP] And then as you might imagine, that provides an interesting environment for us to add on some of the products actually that Satya mentioned very directly in his comments such as EMS or Enterprise Mobility Suite. [SEP] We have already started to see positive results from implementing EMS and we are excited about its potential for growth.","5327":"In fact, our sales in the assistant-enabled category have grown substantially year over year. [SEP] And so it's very large and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assistant enabled devices than probably anyone out there. [SEP] Moving forward, we are continuing to invest heavily in this category, with plans to expand our product line and improve our technology to stay ahead of the competition.","5328":"I'd like to touch on one of our exciting new innovations that's been getting a lot of attention lately. [SEP] When you have Skype translate when two people are talking two different languages and are able to automatically translate without between languages, it's using a deep neural net pens bring together speech synthesis, speech recognition and machine translation with Skype data, that is fairly magical. [SEP] And with its potential to break down language barriers, we believe Skype translate will continue to revolutionize how we communicate with people from all over the world.","5329":"Thank you for your question. As you know, we are always striving to drive growth and improve profitability for our shareholders. [SEP] And so I feel really good about where we are, and you can hopefully tell with the strong guidance that we provided, that we\u2019re very bullish on the current quarter as well.

Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the next earnings call.","5330":"We are extremely proud of how our team has been able to pivot and adapt during this challenging year. [SEP] And the value as we continue to see in SQL next year I do think there is some opportunity for customers to realize the real value from these hybrid benefits. [SEP] Additionally, we have been investing heavily in our training and development programs to ensure that our employees are equipped to handle the evolving demands of the industry.","5331":"Now, moving on to our advertising revenue. As you may know, the advertising industry has been impacted by the pandemic. [SEP] On TV, we are definitely seeing people continue to advertise on TV and use us as a complement. [SEP] However, we have been seeing growth in our digital advertising revenue, particularly in the e-commerce sector.","5332":"Our digital transformation efforts have been a key driver of our success this quarter. [SEP] In fact, if you take Walgreens Boots Alliance, it was Microsoft 365 as well as Azure. [SEP] We have also made significant progress in expanding our e-commerce capabilities and improving our supply chain efficiency.","5333":"Our social media team has been hard at work over the past quarter, leveraging our existing platforms and experimenting with new ones to drive engagement and expand our reach. We're pleased to report that their efforts have been paying off in a big way. [SEP] We hit 200,000 for Instagram, and often the platforms really work together. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a lot of synergy between our various channels. For example, when we post content on Instagram that highlights a product or service, we often see a corresponding increase in traffic on our website and corresponding uptick in sales. It's clear that a multifaceted approach to social media is the way of the future, and we plan to continue investing in these efforts moving forward.","5334":"Now, let's dive into the performance of our various geographic segments. [SEP] So each of the geos did extremely well and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music to iCloud to Apple Pay and more. [SEP] This strong growth is a testament to the dedication and hard work of our teams around the world.","5335":"Can you speak to how you see Facebook's role evolving as people increasingly use it for e-commerce, buying and selling goods, and other transactions? [SEP] But with a strong technological foundation supporting all of these different use cases, the Facebook app has always supported people using all of them. [SEP] And do you see any potential areas for expansion into new use cases in the future?","5336":"The current market conditions are challenging, and we need to adapt to stay competitive. [SEP] So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer, wherever they happen to be. [SEP] This includes exploring new digital channels and expanding our physical presence in key markets.","5337":"During this quarter, we made significant progress in our advertising initiatives. We continued to develop new advertising products and expand our reach into untapped markets. [SEP] We also rolled out ads in Marketplace, which are available in 94 markets, which means advertisers can extend their News Feed ads to Marketplace. [SEP] Our efforts have shown strong results, with overall ad revenue increasing by 25% compared to the same period last year. We plan to continue investing in innovative ad solutions that meet the needs of our users and advertisers alike.","5338":"Our team has been dedicated to enhancing the video capabilities of our products, and we've seen a significant increase in user engagement as a result. [SEP] But what Mark alluded to was video is where people \u2013 as networks improve and devices improve and our products improve, video is the most engaging experience that we can offer. [SEP] We're also exploring new ways to monetize our video content without disrupting the user experience, including sponsored content and targeted advertising. Overall, we're incredibly excited about the potential of video and its role in driving the growth of our business going forward.","5339":"In terms of iPhone performance, we saw strength in our iPhone SE and iPhone 11 models, but this was partially offset by softer demand for our higher-end iPhones. [SEP] So during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no iPhone SE units in channel inventory, so we had to do an at least a partial channel fill that obviously had an impact on ASPs. [SEP] However, we are confident in the continued success of our iPhone lineup, and we expect ASPs to improve in the coming quarters as we work to optimize our channel inventory. Additionally, we are exploring new opportunities for growth in emerging markets, where demand for iPhone SE and other mid-range models remains strong.","5340":"Now, let's move on to discussing our company's performance in the cloud infrastructure market. [SEP] Overall what we have seen is the public cloud or cloud infrastructure makes it much more possible for businesses of all sizes and developers of all sizes to get at infrastructure with much less friction than ever before. [SEP] As a result, we have seen significant growth in our cloud infrastructure business and expect this trend to continue in the coming years.","5341":"Moderator: Our next question comes from Mark Smith with ABC Investments. Please go ahead.\n\nMark: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your infrastructure business. How do you see it performing in this competitive landscape? [SEP] Sure, I'll start Mark and having grown up essentially in our infrastructure business at Microsoft, I would say that compared to even the previous eras where we did well in the client server era, in face of tough competition and in this era again in the face of a different set of competitors, we are doing well and we are doing well much better than we did in the previous era because we are seeing these tier 1 workloads which we never saw in the past. [SEP] Moderator: Thank you, Mark. Our next question comes from Sarah Lee with XYZ Financial. Please go ahead.\n\nSarah: Thank you for your presentation. Could you provide some examples of the tier 1 workloads you mentioned earlier and how they have contributed to your success? \n\nMark: Absolutely. One example would be our work with a major healthcare provider to move their critical patient data to the cloud. This was a huge undertaking and required a lot of expertise and support from our team, but it has been a major success and has contributed significantly to our growth in this space.","5342":"We've been working hard over the past few months to expand our product offerings and improve our operations. [SEP] The ops team has done a great job getting us to a position where we are in and I think that\u2019s going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4. [SEP] We anticipate this new service will help increase our revenue and strengthen our relationship with customers.","5343":"Now turning to our expenses for the quarter. [SEP] And we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, and we're seeing the same thing this year. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to manage these expenses while continuing to grow our business.","5344":"Our advertising revenues continue to grow, driven by the strength of our core Facebook platform and our family of apps. Looking ahead, we remain focused on investing in new products and technologies that will further enhance our user experience and drive long-term growth. [SEP] If you're a large company or a small company, you can buy Facebook. [SEP] Furthermore, we're constantly working to improve the effectiveness of our ad targeting capabilities, which has been a major driver of our success. With our massive user base and sophisticated data analytics capabilities, Facebook is an ideal platform for businesses of all sizes to reach their target audiences and drive sales.","5345":"We've talked a lot about our monthly active users and the growth we've experienced over the past quarter. [SEP] And I think the best proxy for you really beyond any numbers we talk about in terms of monthly active is our capital, so the more capital-efficient we can be, the better we're doing. [SEP] That being said, we're always looking for ways to streamline our operations and decrease costs, which will ultimately benefit our shareholders.","5346":"I'd now like to turn to our iPhone sales, which continue to be a key driver of growth for our company. [SEP] The ramp for iPhone X is going well, especially considering that iPhone X is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created and it has lots of new technologies in it. [SEP] We're seeing strong demand for iPhone X in all of our key markets and are working hard to ramp up production to meet that demand.","5347":"We are pleased to report that our company has experienced considerable growth over the past quarter. [SEP] To grow on a base that big, that kind of rate, you really need pretty strong performance across the board. [SEP] We've seen particularly strong performance in our online sales, with a significant increase in website traffic and conversion rates.","5348":"We're now going to turn to our sales growth over the past quarter. [SEP] So just to put numbers on that, the year-over-year in the U.S. or in North America was 32% growth, which was up from 28% in Q4. [SEP] This growth was driven by strong demand for our products, as well as successful marketing campaigns targeted towards our key demographics.","5349":"As we've previously shared, our cybersecurity team has been monitoring and responding to a sharp increase in attempted cyber attacks against our company over the past few months. These attacks have been coming from a variety of sources and we've identified several patterns. [SEP] We've seen similar types of attempts from Iran, China and some places, others as well. [SEP] We've been working closely with law enforcement and government agencies to identify the specific actors behind these attacks and to implement additional security measures to prevent future breaches. We want to assure our customers that we take their privacy and security very seriously and are doing everything in our power to protect their data.","5350":"Our next question comes from the line of [analyst name] from [firm name]. [SEP] At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments, which Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time picking markets and making sure we execute in them. [SEP] And so, as we look forward, we're very focused on how we continue to grow that market share and grow that TAM [total addressable market]. Again, not just in one vertical or geography, but broadly within the tech industry. So, we're very excited about the opportunities ahead of us.","5351":"Overall, we are pleased with our earnings this quarter and I am happy to report that our margins have increased year-over-year. [SEP] Mark, as I talked a bit about, we've seen a mix shift as we have moved Office 365 and Azure to our premium service and to premium SKUs within our cloud environment, that is one of the drivers that helps improve margin growth. [SEP] Additionally, we have also made improvements in our operational efficiencies which have contributed to our margin growth. Looking ahead, we expect this trend to continue as we invest in our high-growth areas and focus on delivering value to our customers. Thank you all for joining us today.","5352":"We have invested heavily in developing AI tools to help streamline our content analysis processes. [SEP] Now, one of the things that I think is going to be interesting, and in some cases a little frustrating, is that AI tools lend themselves towards identifying certain content a lot more easily than others. [SEP] However, we are aware of this limitation and are constantly working to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of our AI algorithms.","5353":"During the quarter, we have been focusing on enhancing our digital communication capabilities in order to connect with our customers in an efficient and secure way. As we continue to shift toward a more digital world, we recognize the importance of utilizing messaging tools for communication with our customers. [SEP] One of the challenges in retail and in many other industries is what's that messaging tool that has actually got the security framework that they expect of any other enterprise tool as opposed to using one of these consumer messaging tools, which then all the liability is with the enterprise. [SEP] To address this challenge, we have partnered with a secure enterprise messaging provider that meets all of our security and compliance standards. This has not only increased our efficiency in communication but also reduced our liability as an enterprise. Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize secure communication channels to protect both our customers and our business.","5354":"Our Q2 earnings report shows positive growth across our various platforms and products. We continue to invest in innovation and user experience in order to drive engagement and revenue. [SEP] And that includes the Facebook mobile app, where we saw good year-over-year growth in time spent per DAU [SEP] Looking ahead, we are focused on expanding our user base and diversifying our revenue streams. We plan to launch several new features and products in the coming quarters and are excited about their potential to drive growth. Thank you for your continued support and investment in our company.","5355":"Now let's take a closer look at our earnings for the past quarter. [SEP] And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there. [SEP] Despite the challenges, we were able to maintain steady growth and are optimistic about our future prospects.","5356":"Now let's take a closer look at our financials for this quarter. [SEP] If you look at the gross margin, it dropped from 86% to 84%. [SEP] This can be attributed to the increase in production costs due to the implementation of new manufacturing processes.","5357":"We've had a great year in terms of revenue growth and profitability, thanks to our strong product portfolio and expanding customer base. [SEP] And then finally, the last point that we've taken into account is what Tim's talked about in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic level in some emerging markets where clearly consumer confidence is not as high as it was 12 months ago. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy and believe we can navigate the current economic climate by focusing on operational efficiency and innovation. We will continue to closely monitor the situation in these markets and adjust our strategies accordingly.","5358":"In terms of customer behavior, we've been closely monitoring our sales and payment data to identify any emerging trends. [SEP] What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. [SEP] Namely, customers tend to start small with their purchases and payments, but gradually ramp up spending as they become more comfortable with our products and services.","5359":"Our social media team has been closely monitoring the trends and engagement on Instagram. [SEP] On the first, when we think about Instagram, we think we have a great opportunity [SEP] We have seen a significant uptick in user adoption and usage since our last earnings call, and we believe there is even more room for growth.","5360":"Our earnings report for this quarter shows strong growth in our advertising revenue and we are pleased with the results. [SEP] I think specifically on the advertising side and the opportunity with that, we are continuing to see some increased adoption. [SEP] We have also invested in new technologies and partnerships to enhance the effectiveness of our advertising platform and to better target our audiences.","5361":"Our focus on small and medium-sized businesses has been a key driver of our revenue growth over the past year. We have seen strong demand for our advertising products from this sector of the market. [SEP] On SMBs, I think it's one of the most compelling opportunities we have for Facebook [SEP] We are continuing to invest in tools and features that will make it easier for SMBs to advertise on our platform. We believe that by helping these businesses grow, we can create long-term, sustainable value for Facebook and our shareholders.","5362":"We're now going to open the floor for questions, so please go ahead if you have any.\n- Our next topic of discussion is the performance of our advertising revenue for the quarter.\n- I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the hard work of our employees for their dedication during this challenging time. [SEP] Yeah, and on video, we're excited about people sharing all different kinds of content on Facebook. [SEP] We recognize there are still improvements that need to be made in terms of content moderation and privacy concerns, but we're confident in our team's ability to address these issues.\n- As we continue to invest in our video capabilities, we're also exploring new monetization opportunities that will benefit creators and advertisers alike.\n- That being said, we understand the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem on our platform, which is why we're committed to providing our users with a safe and enjoyable experience.","5363":"Our new advertising strategy has been highly effective in reaching our target audience and driving engagement. We've seen a significant increase in both click-through rates and conversions. [SEP] It also really takes people further down the funnel from seeing an ad to having a direct connection with businesses, which consumers like and businesses like. [SEP] This approach has not only benefited our company, but it has also helped small businesses thrive. By providing a direct connection between consumers and businesses, we are able to support our local communities and help them grow. We are committed to continuing to enhance our advertising technology to better serve both consumers and businesses.","5364":"Our company has continued to see growth in our technology and services sectors in recent months. [SEP] And that drives a lot of the higher level services, in particular our data services as well as our AI services when AI services are essentially compute, but what happens is all this compute then requires storage and data, and that\u2019s another place where we see increasing acceleration. [SEP] As we continue to expand our offerings in these areas, we expect to see even greater demand for our data and AI services in the coming years.","5365":"During the quarter, our company saw strong growth in our smartphone sales. We are pleased to share that our flagship model, the iPhone X, was a significant driver of this growth. [SEP] And as I\u2019ve mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top five selling smartphones in urban China were all iPhones. [SEP] This trend is not limited to just China, as we are seeing strong demand for our iPhones in other key markets such as Japan and the United States. We believe that our commitment to innovation and quality is driving this popularity and we will continue to invest in these areas to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","5366":"We've received questions about how to best reach our target audience on social media. [SEP] But it is easier and free to start a Facebook page until you see broad adoption. [SEP] However, we believe that investing in social media advertising will ultimately lead to stronger engagement and conversions.","5367":"Now I'd like to discuss our hiring strategy for the quarter. [SEP] We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices. [SEP] These areas have been driving significant growth for us and we feel that investing in additional sales reps will allow us to further capitalize on these opportunities.","5368":"Our team has been working hard to introduce new iPhone models to the market, and we are excited about their reception among consumers. However, with any new product introduction, we must carefully manage our inventory levels to ensure we are meeting demand without creating excess supply. [SEP] And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically. [SEP] We anticipate that this decline in ASPs will be temporary and that our pricing strategies, combined with strong demand for our products, will allow us to maintain healthy margins in the long term. Additionally, we are focused on optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing processes to reduce costs and improve efficiency across the board.","5369":"Can you give us an update on average revenue per user (ARPU) in your Services business? [SEP] We've got multiple categories in the Services business, so it's difficult to talk about ARPU in general. [SEP] However, I can break down the ARPU for our streaming service and our cloud storage service separately if that would be helpful.","5370":"We continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure and services to support the growing demands of our customers. [SEP] A lot of what we do even in Windows, mostly people don't recognize it, but one of the most important services we run is Windows Update as a cloud service. [SEP] Windows Update delivers critical security and feature updates to over a billion devices worldwide, enabling our customers to stay up to date and secure. We remain committed to providing reliable and efficient cloud-based services to our customers.","5371":"We have received feedback from our customers expressing concerns over the security of our platform. [SEP] I think moving more towards end-to-end encryption and improving security there is the right direction to go in. [SEP] We have already begun investing in new technologies and hiring additional security experts to ensure the safest and most secure experience for our users.","5372":"We have been closely monitoring the performance of our different markets. [SEP] In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see. [SEP] We will be implementing new strategies to address this issue and stimulate growth in these markets.","5373":"The CEO was asked about the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China and how it might impact their business. \n\n\"I think it's important to remember that our company operates on a global scale and we have operations in both the United States and China,\" the CEO began. \"We believe that there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together. [SEP] because there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together, that each country can only prosper if the other does and of course the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper for the world to do well. [SEP] We saw this even during the pandemic when our supply chains were heavily reliant on China to produce certain components,\" the CEO continued. \"We recognize that each country can only prosper if the other does and of course the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper for the world to do well. We remain optimistic about our ability to navigate any challenges that arise and continue to build strong partnerships with both countries.","5374":"We take user safety and content moderation very seriously.\n- Our team has been working diligently to identify and remove harmful content from our platform.\n- Recent events have underscored the importance of responsible content management. [SEP] Let me be clear on this, that people do not want false news or hate speech or bullying or any of the bad content that we're talking about. [SEP] Our goal is to create a safe and enjoyable online community for all users.\n- We are continuing to invest in new technologies and initiatives to improve our content moderation practices.\n- We appreciate the input and feedback from our users and are committed to addressing any concerns they may have.","5375":"We are delighted to report that our recent digital marketing strategies have yielded impressive results. [SEP] They had 56% more website visitors and a 64% increase in sales for tagged products. [SEP] We attribute these outstanding numbers to our targeted advertising campaigns and increased social media presence.","5376":"Our company executives would like to take a moment to discuss the progress we've made over the past year. [SEP] And you may have also noticed that we lowered prices for the third major round of price cuts, since we joined forces with Whole Foods in the summer of 2017. [SEP] Despite the price cuts, we are still seeing strong revenue growth in our grocery business.","5377":"Another important element that has been driving our growth is the company's advertising revenue. [SEP] So, it's an important part of the flywheel and so it's the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products. [SEP] That being said, we are constantly looking for ways to improve the customer experience as we believe that satisfied customers are the key to a sustainable business model.","5378":"During the fiscal quarter, we continued to invest heavily in our health initiatives, including the launch of the Apple Watch Series 5 with enhanced health monitoring features. We believe health will be a key driver of growth for Apple in the years to come. [SEP] But as I've said before, my view is there will be a day in the future that we look back, and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health. [SEP] Our commitment to health extends beyond just hardware products. We are also expanding our health services offerings, such as the health records feature in the Health app and our partnership with Johnson & Johnson for the Heartline study. We are excited about the potential for Apple to have a positive impact on people's lives in this area.","5379":"Our company has seen significant growth in recent months and we are thrilled to report our earnings for this quarter. [SEP] And we hope again as we build this capacity to more and more regions and more and more ZIP codes and adding more and more selection that everyone will see the same thing that we see already in major cities. [SEP] Additionally, we have plans in place to continue expanding our delivery capabilities and enhance our customer experience.","5380":"The integration of Whole Foods into Amazon's operations is progressing well. [SEP] We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together. [SEP] Our customers have given us positive feedback on the new Whole Foods delivery options available through Amazon Prime.","5381":"We have been working on a new product line that we believe will be a game changer in our industry. [SEP] And so, I would sort of expect to begin seeing this somewhere around a year from now. [SEP] Of course, we cannot guarantee the timeline, but we are optimistic about the progress we have made so far.","5382":"Can you comment on how your search engine differentiates itself from competitors in the market?\" \n- \"In terms of content acquisition, could you walk us through your process for obtaining new information to include in search results?\" \n- \"I noticed that your search engine seems to be particularly effective at surfacing relevant news articles. How do you achieve this? [SEP] I mean there's \u2013 if you think about the overall web, there's a lot of public content that's out there that any web search engine can go index and provide. [SEP] And what about private or proprietary content that might not be accessible to the public? How do you gather information for those types of searches?\" \n- \"Do you anticipate any regulatory hurdles or legal challenges in terms of what content your search engine is able to index and provide to users?\" \n- \"Are there any plans to expand into other search-related services, such as image or video search?","5383":"We've had strong demand for our latest model, the iPhone 7, which has been performing well in the market. [SEP] As I look at the number, my point from bringing it up is that there\u2019s a lot of people that haven\u2019t upgraded to a 6 and 6 plus. [SEP] Our marketing team is working on strategies to communicate the benefits of the 6 and 6 plus to those consumers who have not yet upgraded. We anticipate seeing increased sales as a result of these efforts.","5384":"Our sales growth has been strong over the past year, and we've been focused on managing our working capital to support that growth. As a result, our cash conversion cycle has become negative. [SEP] We've got a negative cash conversion cycle and we plan to continue to have that. [SEP] By extending payment terms with our suppliers and improving our inventory management, we've been able to generate cash more quickly than we use it. This has allowed us to invest in strategic initiatives, such as new product development and geographic expansion, without having to rely on external financing.","5385":"Our research and development team has been working tirelessly to stay ahead of the curve and provide our customers with the best possible experience. [SEP] We are adding new technologies, new features, and therefore the cost structures go up. [SEP] However, we are confident that the value our products and services provide will justify the higher costs and make it a worthwhile investment for our customers.","5386":"We have had a strong quarter with our revenue exceeding expectations. [SEP] They have an increased opportunity to grow, and that's why we think our growth to-date continues to be broad-based. [SEP] We are confident that with our strategic plans and investments, we will continue to see sustainable growth in the future.","5387":"Our revenue for the quarter was significantly higher than anticipated, with a year-over-year increase of 25%. [SEP] because we essentially created for SaaS applications and infrastructure applications a way to distribute their applications through us and our channel. [SEP] This innovative approach has positioned us as a leader in the industry and we anticipate continued growth as more companies turn to cloud-based solutions.","5388":"We've been in a legal dispute with our competitor for the past year. It's been a challenging process, but we remain confident in our position. [SEP] And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. [SEP] However, regardless of the outcome, we are focused on continuing to deliver value to our customers and driving growth for our business. We are committed to moving forward and putting this dispute behind us.","5389":"Now, I would like to turn our attention to our guidance for the upcoming quarter. We are confident in our ability to continue our growth trajectory, and we have set a guidance range that reflects our expectations for continued success. [SEP] One thing to keep in mind as we look at this guidance range is the fact that we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro, a year ago for iPad as well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the December quarter last year [SEP] We also took into account the impact of the ongoing trade tensions and macroeconomic factors, which could potentially affect demand for our products. However, we believe that our strong product lineup and loyal customer base will help us navigate these challenges and continue to deliver strong results. Overall, we remain optimistic about the future of Apple and look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters.","5390":"We're really excited to announce our new advertising strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] That basically takes some of that really good targeting and extends that into a much bigger audience, and then we can get more impressions at better value because we're really connecting that with end results that the advertisers value. [SEP] And we believe that this approach will not only increase revenue, but also give our advertisers better ROI on their campaigns.","5391":"Now, let's move on to our recent events and initiatives. [SEP] A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well. [SEP] Overall, we are very happy with the success of Prime Day and are already planning for next year's event.","5392":"We received a lot of feedback from our customers regarding the website redesign. [SEP] So yes, I would say, you're faced with the -- you see it every time you go to our site. [SEP] However, we are actively working on making improvements to the user experience and hope to have a new design implemented soon.","5393":"We have spent a lot of time listening to our customers and understanding their needs and wants. We believe that the experience we provide is the key to our overall success. [SEP] And we think that if we get the experience right, that revenues and profits will be a result of getting that right. [SEP] We have already taken steps to improve the customer experience, such as implementing a new mobile app and redesigning our website. We will continue to invest in and prioritize the customer experience moving forward.","5394":"Our earnings report for this quarter shows a significant increase in revenue and net income compared to the same period last year. [SEP] We have been working on this for a long time whether it is the product and the approach we have taken from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS, even the diversity of our SaaS offerings, and also how we think about going to market. [SEP] Our dedication to innovation and customer-centric solutions has been the driving force behind our success, and we are confident that our continued investment in these areas will position us for long-term growth.","5395":"We've been working hard on some exciting new products and services that we believe will really resonate with our customers. [SEP] And so we've got lots in front of us and we're very excited about getting these out there. [SEP] We're also continuing to invest in new technologies and processes that will help us stay ahead of the competition and drive even more growth in the years to come.","5396":"One area where we have focused our efforts is improving the quality of our content offerings. [SEP] We've made a lot of progress in the last couple of years on content overall. [SEP] Our investment in original programming has been paying off with increased viewership and engagement.","5397":"Our company has been doing business in China for several years now and we've seen tremendous growth in that market. [SEP] I think China is a fantastic geography with an incredible unprecedented level of opportunity there. [SEP] However, we do acknowledge that operating in China also comes with its own set of challenges and we are taking steps to mitigate those risks.","5398":"We have seen an increase in user engagement on our sports-related content. [SEP] On this sports answer, sports is one of the ways that people get together on Facebook and build community. [SEP] Our data shows that sports-related posts have higher sharing rates compared to other types of content on the platform.","5399":"During the past quarter, we've seen an increase in regulations around data privacy and security. [SEP] So we definitely appreciate the pragmatic and forward-looking approach on this topic with the UK and we're going to continue to work with regulators and policy makers in many countries, including the U.S. [SEP] Our goal is to ensure our products and services comply with these regulations while also providing the best experience possible for our customers.","5400":"We have decided to invest heavily in our research and development department. As a result, we are going to be putting a lot of time and resources into developing new products and improving existing ones. [SEP] We are going to put the time in to make this work rather than look for any short-run specific return. [SEP] While this may mean that we won't see an immediate return on our investment, we believe that it will pay off in the long run. We are committed to delivering the best possible products to our customers and are willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.","5401":"Let's move on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] And on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based compensation and other operating expense to our North America, international and AWS segments. [SEP] This change has allowed us to provide greater transparency into the expenses associated with each segment.","5402":"We have seen strong sales growth in the past quarter, driven primarily by our international markets. [SEP] But certainly from an FX point of view, FX headwinds have a dampening effect on margins. [SEP] Despite the FX challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver solid financial results for the full year.","5403":"Our revenue for the quarter was $10 million, down slightly from the same quarter last year. However, our profit margin improved thanks to cost-cutting measures. [SEP] Again, keep in mind the strong dollar doesn't help us on that front. [SEP] Moving forward, we will be exploring options to mitigate the impact of the strong dollar on our revenue. This may include increasing sales in countries with weaker currencies or adjusting our pricing strategy. We remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects.","5404":"We continue to see strong growth in international markets. In particular, our expansion into Mainland China has exceeded our expectations. [SEP] And you can see that in the results with Mainland China being up 100% year-on-year, despite not having a full quarter of sales since we launched in the second half of October. [SEP] We have also seen positive momentum in other markets, such as South Korea and Japan. Our international team is focused on building brand awareness and loyalty to support continued growth in these key markets.","5405":"We've been working hard to diversify our product offering and focus on innovation. [SEP] And I think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action. [SEP] We're excited to continue investing in new technology and bringing even more options to our customers.","5406":"We are very pleased with our Q3 results, which demonstrated strong growth across multiple areas of our business. Our focus on innovation and providing the best experiences for our customers has continued to pay off. [SEP] It's not only with the App Store but there's several categories that are growing very well for us. [SEP] One area where we are particularly excited about is our subscription-based services, which have seen tremendous growth in recent years. We also continue to see strong demand for our hardware products, especially in emerging markets. Overall, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results for our shareholders.","5407":"We've seen a lot of success in our sales efforts over the past quarter. [SEP] But it's a very important core sell motion and more importantly building trust on both sides of that equation. [SEP] And we're confident that by continuing to focus on this core sell motion, we'll see continued growth in the coming quarters.","5408":"We are very excited about the recent progress we have made and the potential for our upcoming products. [SEP] because I'm a big believer in this because I think we have something unique to add. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to bring this to fruition, and I believe that our customers will find tremendous value in what we have to offer.","5409":"Our first quarter earnings report is showing strong growth in our technology division, particularly in our tablet sales. [SEP] So if you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing tablets where we sold twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year. [SEP] Additionally, our smartphone sales continue to hold steady, with a slight increase in sales compared to the same quarter last year.","5410":"Our cloud services have continued to grow steadily over the past few quarters. [SEP] Very little shows up in unearned, and that's the distinction that we're starting to see in many of these Azure contracts. [SEP] As a result, we're confident that our investments in Azure will continue to pay off in the coming years.","5411":"I'd like to take a few moments to discuss some exciting developments in our Office 365 offering,\" \n- \"As many of you know, Office 365 has become a cornerstone of our product portfolio in recent years. [SEP] The other thing that I am also sort of excited about when it comes to Office 365 is for the first time, we're opening up Office 365 not just as a end-user and a enterprise tool in the service, but as a developer platform [SEP] With this move, we hope to unlock even greater value and create new revenue opportunities for our ecosystem of partners and developers.\" \n- \"In addition to these new developer offerings, we are also investing heavily in our enterprise support services to ensure that our customers have the best possible experience with Office 365.","5412":"We've received some questions about the complexity of our new product line. [SEP] But you know, I would keep in mind that the functionality of the product that we\u2019re making is absolutely incredible, the power of it. [SEP] And we believe that once customers see what it can really do, they'll be blown away.","5413":"One of our key priorities for the upcoming year is to further develop our Groups feature. We believe that creating a sense of community within our platform is crucial for engagement and retention. [SEP] So for Groups, the main thing that we're focused on is making it so that connecting with communities of people that you're interested in is going to be as central to the experience as connecting with friends and family. [SEP] We've already begun testing new ways to enhance Group discovery and make it easier for users to join and participate in these communities. We're excited about the potential for this feature to drive growth and keep our users connected to the people and topics they care about most.","5414":"Can you elaborate on how your company is differentiating itself in terms of technology and innovation? [SEP] They are, in fact, doing things in advanced analytics and using machine learning, and that's a place where we have some very unique capabilities. [SEP] We've seen great success with our clients in using these capabilities to optimize their operations and drive growth.","5415":"We've identified a few areas where our platform could be improved. [SEP] So to the extent that we can eradicate that from the platform, that will create a better product, which will also create a stronger long-term community and better business as well. [SEP] We're working hard to ensure that our community is engaged, informed, and happy with the changes we're making to the platform.","5416":"During the earnings call, the company's CEO addressed concerns about a decline in daily active users (DAU) and an increase in the time spent on the app. [SEP] We began to make changes around a number of different quality initiatives in the fourth quarter, so that affected metrics that we've talked about including both the time spent and the DAU. [SEP] However, the CEO went on to explain that these changes were necessary to improve the overall user experience and increase user engagement. The company is confident that these quality initiatives will lead to long-term growth and success.","5417":"Now let's take a look at our seller network and how they're utilizing our services. [SEP] And just as big as the number of sellers, the sellers, the number of sellers has grown more than 250% year-over-year, 90% of those sellers are using our logistics and warehouse services. [SEP] This growth in our logistics services has had a significant impact on our revenue and we expect it to continue to be a key driver of our business in the future.","5418":"We have been closely monitoring our expenses and have made several cost-cutting measures to ensure our financial stability. [SEP] And so I have really no intention of messing with that in terms of capital expenditures in the short and next six months for sure. [SEP] However, we will review our spending plans for the latter half of the year and make adjustments if necessary to align with our business goals.","5419":"We had a strong quarter with revenue growth exceeding our expectations. [SEP] So I actually think in a lot of ways though the more interesting question is not in the near-term what we're going to do to develop ways to consume long form content, but what traditional media and content producers who have traditionally produced short and long form content are going to do to chunk their stuff up better so that way it can be more easily consumed by this big community online. [SEP] Our team is actively exploring ways we can work with traditional media partners to address this challenge and unlock new opportunities for both of us.","5420":"We see a lot of opportunities in the transportation sector. Our transportation services have been growing steadily in recent years, and we are excited to continue expanding this part of our business. [SEP] What we like about our ability to participate in transportation is that a lot of times, we can do it at the same cost or better and we like the cost profile of the two. [SEP] This year, we are planning to invest in new technologies that will make our transportation operations even more efficient. We believe that these investments will ultimately lead to greater cost savings, and we are confident that we can continue to offer competitive pricing to our customers.","5421":"We are excited to share that we have made significant progress in our efforts to simplify and streamline our advertising tools. This quarter, we have launched a number of new features that we believe will make it easier for businesses of all sizes to reach their target audiences. [SEP] So for example, advertisers can now buy Stories across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger all at once. [SEP] This is just one example of how we are working to make our advertising tools more flexible and accessible. We believe that by offering a comprehensive suite of advertising solutions, we can help businesses of all sizes grow and succeed in the digital marketplace. We look forward to continuing to innovate and improve our platform in the months and years ahead.","5422":"We have a question from one of our investors about our performance in the U.S. and Canada segment. [SEP] And I think the answer largely is the same as I've given on previous calls, which is the U.S. and Canada segment is really a pure-play developed market, which is U.S. and Canada is the 2 countries in that segment. [SEP] Can you elaborate more on what you mean by a pure-play developed market and how that impacts our strategy moving forward?","5423":"We have received a lot of questions about the sustainability initiatives we announced last quarter, so I wanted to take some time to address them today. [SEP] So I think the directionality of sustainability is correct and I think the variability can certainly occur from any of the reasons Satya talked about. [SEP] Overall, I am confident that our sustainability efforts will not only benefit the environment, but also drive long-term value for our shareholders.","5424":"One of the key challenges we face is understanding the needs of our customers and how we can better serve them. [SEP] But at the same time, I think that if you ask anyone, at least in our campus whether we deeply get what it means to reinvent productivity I believe do we get deeply how to take the various constituents from end users IT and developers and harmonize their interest in unique ways so that enterprises can adopt solutions, we get that deeply. [SEP] That being said, we always strive to improve our understanding of our customers and their needs in order to continue to provide innovative and valuable solutions.","5425":"One of the challenges we faced this quarter was the implementation of our new data privacy policies. [SEP] And so I'd say that was largely within the range of expectations that we saw and it is having an impact and the people who are opting out are seeing less relevant ads. [SEP] However, overall we are still seeing strong user engagement and our ad revenue is holding steady.

[SEP] However, we have developed algorithms and methods to detect and penalize any deceptive or misleading promotional practices that violate our community guidelines.","5432":"We've received a lot of interest from our investors about our plans for expansion.

We plan to continue this strategy in the upcoming quarters and are exploring new ways to entice customers to shop with us.","5436":"We have never seen such a strong demand for our services, and we continue to invest in our infrastructure to meet that demand. One of the key areas we are focusing on is expanding our one-day shipping capabilities.

Our long-term goal is to create a seamless and efficient delivery network that can make same-day shipping a reality in the near future.","5437":"We'll now open the floor for questions.

[SEP] In addition, we are constantly working on improving our privacy controls to ensure that users have the ability to control their own data and share it only with those they choose.","5442":"We had a strong quarter for iPhone sales, driven by the launch of the iPhone 12 lineup. However, we are keeping a close eye on how the global semiconductor shortage will impact our supply chain in the coming months.

[SEP] We are also excited about the upcoming rollout of our new Apple One subscription bundle, which will offer customers a convenient way to access all of our services with one monthly payment. Overall, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of our services business and will continue to invest in new offerings and partnerships to drive further expansion.","5443":"During the quarter, we experienced a surge in demand for our products, which tested our supply chain capabilities.

Additionally, we will be investing in research and development to bring innovative solutions to market and stay ahead of industry trends.","5502":"We've been experimenting with various ways to monetize our platform and have made some progress in recent months. As we've mentioned before, we believe advertising offers a promising avenue for generating revenue, and we've been conducting some initial tests in this area. [SEP] One is we're starting to put some ads into the product just to see the basic parameters around how that performs, how people like the ads or don't, how they work for businesses, and just try to get an understanding of that. [SEP] So far, the results have been mixed, but we're encouraged by some of the metrics we're seeing. We've also received some feedback from our users about the ads, which has been helpful in refining our approach. We'll continue to iterate on this and explore other opportunities for monetization as we aim to build a sustainable business over the long term.","5503":"Our e-commerce business is a key driver of growth for us, and we are constantly evaluating ways to improve our fulfillment and delivery capabilities.

[SEP] If you look at what we are doing with SQL, we will have the ability for any customer of SQL to stretch even a single table from between their on-premise to the cloud. [SEP] This feature represents a significant step forward in our efforts to provide a seamless and flexible hybrid cloud solution for our customers.","5505":"We believe that our company has a unique advantage in terms of creating and sharing engaging video content. [SEP] So to the extent that video can serve as a touchstone for building community and helping facilitate interaction, then that's the thing that we feel like we can uniquely do. [SEP] Our strategy moving forward will be to continue investing in video production and distribution platforms to further enhance the experience for our users.","5506":"One thing we've noticed in our user data is a growing trend towards social sharing. People not only want to consume content, but they want to share it with others as well. This has really driven our focus on improving our family of apps to make sharing easier and more convenient for our users. [SEP] And we definitely do see in this family of app strategy that there's so many new ways that people want to share content, and so many different types of sets of people that people want to share with, right, ranging from one person at a time and that would be messaging or small group sharing or sharing with interest-based communities or sharing with all your friends at once or sharing with public. [SEP] We're particularly excited about the growth we're seeing in interest-based communities. We've seen some great engagement from users who are passionate about specific topics, whether it's cooking, fitness, or gaming. We believe this is a key area of growth for our company, and we're actively exploring new ways to foster these communities within our apps.\n\nOverall, we remain committed to investing in our family of apps to meet the evolving needs of our users.

[SEP] We're confident that our comprehensive approach to ad tech will continue to drive strong results for our company.","5510":"One analyst asked about the company's recent quarterly earnings report and inquired about any trends in customer migration patterns. [SEP] There are differences in migration patterns that will make any quarter-to-quarter movements lumpy, as I said. [SEP] However, over a longer period of time, we expect to see a more consistent trend in migration patterns based on our internal data and market research.","5511":"Our recent product launches have been successful and customer feedback has been positive. [SEP] Looking forward, we continue to feel like there are good opportunities to grow the business.

We believe our unique approach and focus on customer satisfaction has set us apart from the competition, and the numbers prove it. We are excited to continue building on this momentum and delivering exceptional value to our customers.","5514":"Can you walk us through the factors that contributed to the decline in revenue in Q1 of this year? [SEP] So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it. [SEP] But we're now seeing a much healthier level of channel inventory, and we're confident that this will set us up for stronger growth going forward.","5515":"Our team has been working diligently to develop new product features that will enhance the shopping experience for our customers. [SEP] And so we spent a lot of time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback is telling us that it's useful and helpful and customers making those purchase decisions. [SEP] We have seen positive results and are confident that these changes will continue to benefit our customers in the future.","5516":"Can you walk us through the different ways that your company distributes its products and services?

[SEP] Overall, our goal is to provide our customers with a range of flexible and scalable options that meet their specific needs and help them achieve their business goals.","5517":"We have seen a significant shift towards cloud adoption in the past few years. [SEP] But to your point, Raimo, I think what has happened is the change, even in the financial services, the segments that you all represent, the kinds of workloads now that are moving to the cloud has qualitatively changed.

We anticipate that this will lead to an increase in revenue and earnings in the upcoming quarter.","5519":"Investor: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a bit about your strategy around video content? \n\nResponse: Sure, happy to. [SEP] On the video question, we're basically focused primarily on video on our own site and service, and video tends to be pretty short form content right now on Facebook because it's playing in News Feed. [SEP] We do see longer-form video gaining traction on Facebook Watch, but for now, our main focus is on creating engaging, shorter-form videos that work well in the News Feed. As we continue to expand our video offerings, we'll be exploring more ways to incorporate longer-form content into our platform.","5520":"Now let's turn our attention to our privacy and security initiatives. [SEP] So when I first announced that we were going to be moving our private communication services to all be end-to-end encrypted, I was very clear that we\u2019re planning on taking at least a year to go consult with experts and governments and law enforcements around the world to make sure that we have the right safety systems in place to make sure that we handle this really well, right? [SEP] And I want to assure our users that we are committed to making sure their privacy and safety are our top priorities as we implement these changes.","5521":"We have received several questions about how we measure our company's performance and what specific metrics we use. I would like to take a moment to address these concerns. [SEP] The way to think about that how is I look at \u2013 well, the way I would generally say it is you look at each of the KPIs we give. [SEP] For example, if we are discussing our revenue growth, we look at our top-line performance. If we are analyzing our customer engagement, we examine our user retention rates. By focusing on these KPIs, we can get a clear picture of our overall performance and identify areas for improvement.","5522":"As we look ahead to the next quarter, we see a lot of potential for growth in several different areas. One of those areas is our e-commerce platform, which has been steadily gaining traction over the past few months. [SEP] So this is just a big opportunity, and one of the areas that I'm quite excited about. [SEP] Of course, there are also some challenges that we need to overcome in order to fully capitalize on this opportunity. We'll need to invest in additional marketing and advertising efforts, and we'll need to build out our team to ensure that we can handle increased demand. But overall, I'm confident that we have the right strategy in place to succeed in this space.","5523":"We've seen a lot of changes in the market lately due to the pandemic. It's been a challenging time for all businesses. [SEP] And I think we, as many other companies, are really trying to absorb what this all means. [SEP] As we move forward, we're making a concerted effort to adapt to these changes and innovate where we can. Our priority remains to provide the best experience for our customers, even in these changing times.","5524":"Can you comment on any upcoming product releases or initiatives that we can expect to see from the company in the next few quarters?

[SEP] I understand that you can't provide any specifics at this time, but can you give us a general sense of the areas in which you are focusing your efforts?","5525":"Our cybersecurity team has been working tirelessly to ensure that our systems are protected from any potential threats. [SEP] So even to the extent that we may not even see specific attacks, but if there's a big meme that there is widespread interference, that has the same effect in terms of kind of sowing doubt about things. [SEP] We are also closely monitoring social media platforms and news outlets to ensure that any misinformation or false claims are quickly addressed and corrected.","5526":"We've been working hard to make improvements to our suite of apps, and I'm happy to say that we're seeing positive results. Our users are responding well to the changes we've made, and we're already seeing increased engagement across the board. [SEP] The apps will always continue to have their own identity and brand now because they -- people use them for somewhat different things, and that's really important. [SEP] That said, we are exploring ways to make these apps more interoperable, so users can seamlessly move between them as their needs change. We believe this will be particularly valuable for our business users, who often need to switch between different tools throughout the day.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to create a seamless user experience that caters to a variety of needs. We're committed to investing in research and development to ensure that our suite of apps continues to evolve and meet the changing needs of our users.","5527":"Our social media platform has been performing well in Europe, and I wanted to share some exciting news with our investors.

[SEP] We are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the Q2 guidance and continue our growth trajectory for the rest of the year.","5530":"We've seen great success with our advertising campaigns using carousel ads on social media platforms. Our strategy is to provide personalized content to our target audiences in order to increase engagement and drive sales. [SEP] So the carousel ads, they're not just that they're showing multiple products, it's that they're showing products that are more specifically directed at the person. [SEP] Through our data analysis, we are able to determine what products are of interest to each individual and use that information to showcase those products in the carousel ad. This has led to a significant increase in click-through rates and ultimately, conversions. We plan to continue utilizing this approach in our advertising campaigns moving forward.","5531":"Our quarterly earnings have been impacted by several external factors. We've seen fluctuations in currency exchange rates and there have been changes in privacy regulations that have affected our business. [SEP] So I think when you look at the factors going forward, I would say we've got the currency impact, we've got some of the impacts around privacy and the like, but we continue to get good advertiser feedback on ROI. [SEP] Despite these challenges, however, we're seeing positive signs from advertisers in terms of return on investment. We believe our focus on providing value to our customers and our commitment to innovation will help us navigate these headwinds and emerge stronger.","5532":"We've seen a significant shift in advertising focus over the last year. [SEP] So one of the things advertisers are trying to do when they're in feed and ultimately when they're in Stories is drive to transactions and real engagement, one-on-one with a consumer is often part of that. [SEP] To enable this, we've been investing heavily in our e-commerce capabilities on the platform.","5533":"Our company has seen significant growth in recent years, particularly in the area of social media and messaging services.

[SEP] To that end, we are exploring the possibility of integrating our messaging services across platforms and creating a more seamless experience for our users. While there are certainly some logistical challenges associated with this approach, we believe that it has the potential to greatly enhance the user experience and drive further growth for our company. We look forward to sharing more updates on this effort in the coming months.","5534":"We've seen significant growth in international markets, particularly in regions like Asia and Europe. Our sales teams have been working hard to establish new relationships with partners in these regions, and we're starting to see the fruits of their labor. [SEP] The -- of course the proportion of one-day shipments is higher in international to begin with in a lot of our countries. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with our progress in international markets, but we know there's still work to be done. We'll be investing more resources into expanding our operations in key regions and improving our transportation networks to reduce delivery times. With these efforts, we're confident we can continue to grow our business and deliver strong results for our shareholders.","5535":"In talking about our overall cloud strategy, it's also important to mention the role that Microsoft Azure plays. [SEP] I think about the Microsoft Cloud because even the way we do capital, the way we measure utilization is all with the complete unit, which is of course all of Office 365 runs on Azure, Azure AD powers all of our Cloud, and even Dynamics 365 runs on Azure infrastructure. [SEP] It's clear that our investment in the Microsoft Cloud is paying off, and we will continue to explore opportunities to leverage its capabilities and drive growth for our business.","5536":"As we look towards the future of our business strategy...

Looking ahead, we remain committed to delivering the best-in-class cloud services that our customers have come to expect from us.","5538":"Overall, we saw strong performance in our software and services divisions, which partially offset weaker-than-expected hardware sales. However, we did experience some headwinds in the form of rising material costs and competitive pricing pressure. [SEP] And so I actually think between those two items, it's the biggest impact that we've seen in the quarter, and I expect to see it again next quarter, given I don't think the macro or IT spend environment should change in any way between these two quarters. [SEP] We are actively exploring ways to mitigate the impact of these factors, including potential price adjustments and supply chain optimizations. In the meantime, we remain focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers and maintaining our market leadership position.","5539":"We've had a lot of exciting developments in the past quarter.

[SEP] Our team is already working on ways to enhance these experiences and create even more opportunities for interaction and engagement.","5546":"We've received a lot of questions about our mobile app offerings, so let's dive into that now. As you all know, mobile usage is on the rise and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our app offerings.

We also saw a lot of success with the Facebook Marketplace app as it helps facilitate buying and selling within the community. Our focus moving forward will be on developing apps that add value to our core services.","5547":"I would now like to touch on our production capacity.

[SEP] And as I've always said that there is -- hybrid computing is important for workloads that are more in the characteristic -- can be characterized as lift, shift and modernize, so that's one motion. [SEP] And then we also see pure cloud for net new workloads where customers want to take advantage of cloud-native services and innovation. So, it's really a two-pronged approach that we take with our customers.","5553":"As we continue to grow our business and expand our reach to new markets, one of our key strategic priorities is to optimize our logistics and supply chain operations.

We believe that our strong financial position and diversified portfolio will help us navigate through any challenges that may arise in the coming year.","5577":"In terms of our cloud offerings, we're seeing strong growth in both Azure and Office 365.

[SEP] Our customers are increasingly turning to us as a trusted partner for their digital transformation journeys, and Azure's capabilities have been a key factor in our ability to meet their evolving needs.","5578":"One question we've received from investors is whether we plan to continue offering our software on-premises or if we will be transitioning completely to the cloud. [SEP] Because right now, given the secular trend to move to the cloud across all of the regulated industries across the globe, we think it's wiser for us and our investors long term to be able to meet them where they are.

We are excited to share that we had a successful quarter with strong sales figures. [SEP] On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top selling smartphone during the quarter. [SEP] This success can be attributed to the strong demand for the iPhone X, which exceeded our expectations. Additionally, our marketing efforts and customer loyalty programs helped drive sales of our other products, including the Apple Watch and iPad. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum we have going into the next quarter.","5596":"Our earnings report for this quarter shows a decline in unit sales compared to the same period last year. [SEP] As I've talked in other quarters, it's a number that's excludes AWS subscription services, advertising and Whole Foods, which are some of the fastest growing areas and we also have \u2013 are actively selling subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited, which can cannibalize unit sales. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain committed to investing in innovative products and services that meet the evolving needs of our customers.","5597":"Now moving on to our growth strategy for the upcoming year. [SEP] and so the fact that we have so much room to grow is exciting for us. [SEP] We have already identified several opportunities for expansion in new markets and can't wait to see our efforts translate to increased revenue.","5598":"Now let's turn to the performance of our company. [SEP] The overall economy is certainly also quite good, and the installed base had actually gotten older. [SEP] However, we saw some challenges in our sales department due to increased competition.","5599":"Our Cloud business has experienced significant growth over the past year. [SEP] And that's where a lot of the transformation we have done internally is helping us accelerate our Cloud business. [SEP] By streamlining our processes and investing in new technology, we are now better equipped to meet the demands of our customers in this space.","5600":"We've seen tremendous growth in our user base this year and we want to ensure that we can maintain the trust and safety of our platform for all users.

Our engineering team has been working hard to optimize our systems for scalability and reliability. [SEP] And so, while this really is \u2013 the majority of this spend is servers. [SEP] But we're also investing in other areas, such as machine learning and data analysis. Our goal is to continue to improve our product and provide the best possible experience for our users.","5602":"We're excited to see a significant increase in user engagement on our platform. One of the contributing factors has been our efforts to introduce new features that are user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of people. [SEP] They're free, they're easy to set up, and they already know how to do them because almost all of them are already Facebook users in the first place. [SEP] We believe that this will continue to drive growth and attract even more users to our platform in the coming quarters.","5603":"During the Q&A session, a participant asked about the company's plans for migrating their systems to the cloud. [SEP] That I think the future which is distributed computing going back to what needs to be truly distributed, even driven server-less even versus this thing about let's just have one-time migration to something new. [SEP] I believe that by embracing distributed computing and going server-less, we can achieve true agility and scalability in our infrastructure, rather than just trying to replicate our current setup in the cloud.","5604":"Now let's turn to our revenue streams from our software contracts. [SEP] These are contracts that unless it is used and deployed and a customer gets value from, it does not land into the P&L. [SEP] As such, we are optimistic about our continued growth potential as more customers realize the value of our solutions.","5605":"Moving on to our financial performance for the quarter, I'm pleased to report solid results across the board. [SEP] In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us as it is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double digits over last year during the quarter and so we're thrilled with that and you can see that carrying through to the services line and the growth that we had there. [SEP] Looking ahead, we expect to continue to see strong growth in our services business as our installed base continues to expand and our offerings become even more attractive to our customers.","5606":"Now, let's turn to our second quarter performance. [SEP] As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. [SEP] This growth was driven by our successful product launches and strong marketing campaigns.","5607":"We have recognized that the community is what makes GitHub successful. [SEP] And so therefore that's why we want to ensure that everything we do and the number one priority for Nat and team at GitHub will be all about maintaining that GitHub community, the ethos around developers at the core. [SEP] We believe that continued investment in the community will benefit both our users and our business in the long term.","5608":"We have seen some positive momentum in user engagement over the past quarter, but we know there is still room for improvement. [SEP] On engagement, John, I think we're obviously focused across a number of different dimensions to drive engagement. [SEP] Some of the initiatives we are putting in place include personalized content recommendations, enhanced social features, and expanded video content.","5609":"We have received a lot of feedback from our customers regarding our latest product release. We are taking their feedback seriously and trying to address their concerns. [SEP] And so we continue to work on that, but not much new to add right now. [SEP] However, I can tell you that our team is dedicated to improving the user experience and we have some exciting plans in the works. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming months.","5610":"Moving on to our second topic for today's conference call: industry trends and challenges. [SEP] The second is platform changes as it relates to operating systems and a more of a focus on privacy from the operating systems and the impact that that can have on measurements and also on targeting. [SEP] We believe it's important to stay ahead of these changes and adapt our strategies accordingly to continue delivering value for our clients.","5611":"We've been investing a lot in improving our ad targeting and measurement capabilities. [SEP] It's too early to see any direct impact, but I think it's part of the innovation that you'll see from us as we continue to roll out different ways that marketers can use our tools, different ways they can pay, different results they can target. [SEP] Overall, we're very optimistic about the opportunities this will create for us and our advertisers in the long run.","5612":"Now let's talk about our performance in the last quarter. [SEP] The only transactional weakness I felt in the quarter at all was what we covered, which was the OEM impact from the chip supply, which was about 1.5 points of growth on MPC, and the Office Consumer impact, which was secondary impact of the PC environment plus some execution challenges we had that I feel really good that we've gotten to the root of and will get handled in H2. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we still managed to exceed our revenue target for the quarter. Our team has been working hard to address these issues and we are confident that we will see improved results in the second half of the year.","5613":"We've been investing heavily in our supply chain over the past year, and I'm happy to report that these efforts are starting to pay off. Our fulfillment times have improved significantly, and we're able to deliver products to our customers faster than ever before. [SEP] But in the long run we\u2019re going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that we\u2019ve used in the past. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to explore opportunities to expand our capacity as needed. This could include investing in new warehouses or distribution centers, or partnering with additional carriers who can help us meet growing demand. But for now, we feel confident in our ability to meet our customers' needs and continue growing our business over the long term.","5614":"Now moving on to our capital allocation strategy. As you know, we've had a strong year in terms of revenue and profits. But we also want to make sure we're making strategic investments for future growth. [SEP] So when I think about even the capital allocation per quarter we very carefully look at what is our current utilization forecast, and what our demand forecast is. [SEP] Based on our analysis, we've decided to allocate more funds towards R&D in the upcoming quarter, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning. We believe this will give us a competitive advantage in the long-term. Of course, we'll continue to monitor our utilization and demand forecasts to ensure we're making the most informed decisions.","5615":"Our company has always been focused on pursuing strategic acquisitions that will enable us to grow and expand our operations. [SEP] And if anything comes up in M&A which allows us to pursue our strategic vision that we will need to even allocate more to on an OpEx basis, post-acquisition we will look at that. [SEP] However, we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to our expenses and ensure that any allocation of resources is in line with our overall financial goals and objectives.","5616":"And to follow up on that question, can you discuss how your PaaS offerings are being received by customers? [SEP] So that's the network effect that we see when it comes to the PaaS services. [SEP] It's been a strong driver of growth for us, and we believe that we're well positioned to continue capturing market share in this area.","5617":"Our revenue growth this quarter was driven largely by our productivity and business processes segment, which saw a 19% increase in revenue year over year. [SEP] And if you think about that, it\u2019s the Windows commercial, it\u2019s Office 365 commercial and EMS. [SEP] We continue to see strong demand for these offerings from both consumer and enterprise customers, and we are confident in our ability to grow our market share in these areas in the coming quarters.","5618":"Now turning to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. [SEP] This decision has resulted in strong shareholder returns and we plan to continue this practice going forward.","5619":"Our company is excited to announce some exciting new partnerships and initiatives that we hope will continue to drive growth and innovation in the unmanned aerial vehicle space. [SEP] And we're extremely happy to partner with the UK government to advance the safe use of drones for small parcel delivery. [SEP] We believe that this partnership will not only benefit our company and shareholders, but also contribute to the broader goal of making drone technology more accessible and useful to people around the world.","5620":"Our financial results this quarter demonstrate the continued strength of our business and the demand for AWS services. [SEP] As I talked about earlier, that\u2019s one factor customers save a lot of money, but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move really quickly. [SEP] We will continue to invest in innovation and expanding our capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","5621":"One of the questions we often get asked is how we define our cloud offerings. [SEP] Let me start by saying we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components, from the IaaS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer. [SEP] We believe this comprehensive approach allows us to provide the most flexible and scalable solutions for our customers.","5622":"During the second quarter, our digital marketing team implemented a new advertising strategy to drive more online bookings. [SEP] Celebrity Cruises used these Dynamic Ads for travel on both Facebook and Instagram to increase their online bookings. [SEP] As a result of the Dynamic Ads campaign, we saw a 25% increase in online bookings compared to the same period last year.","5623":"We are constantly evaluating our strategies to ensure we are utilizing the most effective resources. [SEP] That's something you're going to deploy, whether that's EMS, is the best example. [SEP] Our team has conducted extensive research and testing to determine the most beneficial solution for this particular issue.","5624":"We have seen incredible growth in video content on our platform and we believe there is still a lot of potential for us to capture. [SEP] And there's a pretty clear roadmap of stuff that we're going to do over the next couple of years that I'm quite excited about to add some more dimensions to the video experience on Facebook. [SEP] Our team is already hard at work on these initiatives and we look forward to sharing more details with you in the coming months.","5625":"As we analyze our financial performance, it's important to consider some of the factors that may contribute to fluctuations in our gross margin. One of these factors is our product mix. [SEP] Also, the mix of products that we sell into the market tends to change over time, and that also has an impact on the overall gross margin for the company. [SEP] To maintain a healthy gross margin, we continually evaluate the profitability of our product offerings and make adjustments as needed. We anticipate that this ongoing analysis and adjustment process will help us maintain a strong financial position in the years to come.","5626":"We understand that our customers have high expectations of us and we are committed to meeting and exceeding those expectations. [SEP] And this is something that Kevin Turner, myself and Amy and all of our leadership team is very focused on. [SEP] Through our investments in technology and infrastructure, we believe we can deliver an even better experience for our customers and drive growth for our company.","5627":"We're very excited to see a lot of buzz and interest around our new product launches in the last quarter. [SEP] And so that -- when you have that kind of first time buyer rates, you don\u2019t have a saturated market. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a steady increase in our first time buyer rates over the past few months, which is a great indication of growth potential for our business.","5628":"During the past quarter, we achieved record-breaking sales for our latest iPhone models. [SEP] And also that the current iPhone line up experienced the highest Android switcher rate in any of the last three launches in the three previous years. [SEP] We believe this is due to our continued focus on providing a superior user experience and introducing new features that exceed customer expectations.","5629":"Our advertising revenue for this quarter has exceeded our expectations and we are pleased with the results. [SEP] And click to Messenger ads on Facebook are actually very promising as well because advertisers want to see a return for the money they spend. [SEP] We are also exploring new advertising opportunities on other social media platforms to expand our reach and generate even more revenue.","5630":"Now moving on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] So we're really happy that our growth has been really strong across our verticals, and that continues to be the case. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to sustain this growth and remain optimistic about the future of our company.","5631":"We continue to focus on improving the user experience while also driving revenue growth. One way we're doing this is through our messaging platform, which has seen significant growth over the past year. [SEP] And we're also in the early days of sponsored messages, which enable businesses to reengage people once a conversation has started. [SEP] Our sponsored messages have already shown promising results in terms of engagement and conversion rates. We believe this will be a key driver of our future revenue growth as more businesses look to leverage our messaging platform for customer outreach.","5632":"Thank you for the question, Shannon. [SEP] Yeah, Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if you look for the cycle, by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid single digit and ASP growth of double digit. [SEP] We believe this demonstrates the strength of our product offerings and our ability to continue to innovate and meet consumer demand.","5633":"We believe that our platform is designed to foster meaningful interactions between people and to help build communities. Our mission has always been to connect people from all over the world and make their lives better. [SEP] And it also follows the well-being research that we've done that suggests that when people use the Internet for interacting with people and building relationships, that is correlated with all of the positive measures of well-being that you just expect like longer term health and happiness, feeling more connected and less lonely, whereas just passively consuming content is not necessarily positive on those dimensions. [SEP] As a company, we are committed to improving the well-being of our users, and we are constantly looking for new ways to make our platform a positive force in people's lives. We believe that our focus on building relationships and fostering meaningful interactions sets us apart from other social media platforms and will continue to be a key driver of our success.","5634":"During the quarter, we launched a new marketing campaign to promote our digital payment solutions. [SEP] Visa with SocialCode and BBDO created 10-second videos with text overlays showing people making digital payments. [SEP] The 10-second videos were distributed on various social media platforms and had a high engagement rate, reaching millions of viewers.","5635":"Our cost-saving initiatives have been successful and we're pleased to report our financial results for the quarter. We've been able to decrease our overall expenses by 15% through streamlining our operations and renegotiating contracts with vendors. [SEP] And so what you can then see, relating to the second half your question, is that we are taking some of those savings and investing them back into the business in some of these key growth areas we've seen. [SEP] Specifically, we're looking to expand our online presence and invest in digital marketing to reach a wider audience. We've also allocated funds to research and develop new product lines that align with consumer trends. We believe these investments will position us for long-term growth and success in the market.","5636":"In terms of our international operations, we faced some challenges this quarter. [SEP] But generally speaking, I see positive vectors there, not negative, in the aggregate. [SEP] Our team is working to address the issues we've identified and we're optimistic about future growth opportunities.","5637":"Our recurring revenue has been a bright spot for us this quarter. We have seen strong growth and stability in that area. [SEP] I expect that to continue, although you will have volatility because what's interesting about that specific metric is, it has a little bit more 606 impact than we\u2019ve felt it's an on-prem product. [SEP] However, we are still monitoring the 606 impact closely and adjusting our strategy accordingly. Overall, we're confident in our ability to navigate through any volatility and continue delivering value to our customers.","5638":"As we continue to expand our cloud offerings, we're noticing a trend towards more third-party vendors integrating their products and services with our platform. This includes both proprietary and open source tools. [SEP] At the same time, we're also seeing a lot of open source ISVs also be part of the Azure marketplace. [SEP] This has led to a diverse ecosystem of applications within our Azure marketplace, providing customers with greater choice and flexibility. We're excited to see how this trend continues to evolve and contribute to the growth of our cloud business.","5639":"We've been closely monitoring user behavior across all platforms and have noticed some interesting trends.
