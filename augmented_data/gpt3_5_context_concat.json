We saw significant growth in our Instagram ad business, and we are excited about the potential for continued success in this area.

[SEP] Is this a concern that you have for your own AAA game development efforts, or is this more of a general industry trend that you're observing?","22":"Our revenues have been growing, particularly in our digital advertising segment, but we are also facing some challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the constant evolution of the advertising market.

We're thrilled to see continued growth in both sales and engagement with our Alexa-enabled products. [SEP] One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to it is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever you may be is being able to listen to music. [SEP] Additionally, we're seeing an uptick in the use of Alexa for home automation and managing daily tasks.

[SEP] However, we know that to really hit our goals, we need to expand the market and reach new audiences,\" added the CFO.","38":"We've seen some fluctuations in our sales numbers lately, and we've been trying to identify the root causes. One area we've been looking at is our promotional strategies. [SEP] So, on the promotion side, we don't consider it a huge factor either way. [SEP] However, we also recognize the importance of staying competitive and offering incentives to our customers. So while we don't consider promotions to be a major driving force behind our sales, we will still be utilizing them strategically in the future.","39":"During the quarter, we made some significant announcements and introduced new products that we believe will continue to drive growth for the company. [SEP] I mean I have to start with the fact that we did recently introduce 20 new Fire TV products, so that includes the new \u2013 and the first Fire TV Edition Sound Bar, Fire TV Cube.

[SEP] Yes, we are seeing headwinds in terms of targeting and measurement. [SEP] However, we are actively working on improving our targeting and measurement capabilities through investment in new technology and partnerships.","49":"Can you tell us about the different social media platforms your company is utilizing? [SEP] We're not just on Facebook. [SEP] In fact, we're also active on Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn, which allows us to reach a wider audience and engage with our customers in different ways.","50":"During the last quarter, our public cloud segment saw substantial growth as we continue to invest heavily in this area. We are confident that we have the right strategy in place to capitalize on the shift to cloud computing. [SEP] There a few of us who are at scale in public cloud who are very competitive, and anybody who decides to be multi-cloud, public cloud, those are the winners. [SEP] We are constantly evaluating our multi-cloud strategy to ensure that we are leveraging the best technologies from various providers.

And that's been driven primarily by Azure, where we're seeing strong demand from our enterprise customers. [SEP] So even as we continue to see Azure gross margin improvement at the IaaS and PaaS layer, just given the TAM and our opportunities, it will create long-term pressure on that gross margin number. [SEP] However, we believe the overall growth potential and customer satisfaction that we'll achieve by expanding our cloud offerings far outweigh any short-term pressure on margins. And we're confident that our ongoing investments in cloud infrastructure and services will continue to drive solid growth and profitability over the long term.","52":"We have some exciting updates to share with you about our company's growth strategy moving forward.

This demonstrates our ability to generate strong returns for our investors while also delivering value to our users. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to drive sustained growth and capitalize on new opportunities in the market.","66":"During the past few quarters, we have been investing heavily in emerging technologies to stay ahead of the curve.

[SEP] Our R&D team is constantly exploring these areas and incorporating the latest advancements into our products and services.","67":"During the last quarter, we've seen significant growth in the number of people using our post search feature. This is a great sign that people are engaging more on Facebook and finding more value in the content that's being shared on our platform. [SEP] But there's certainly great content that people are finding using post search, but it's really \u2013 the focus is really to try and allow people to discover content that's been shared on Facebook that's relevant to them, and that's going to be the focus in the near term.

Overall, we remain optimistic about the future and the potential for our business to continue its upward trajectory.","69":"During the second quarter, we saw a slowdown in revenue growth compared to the previous quarter. [SEP] We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year particularly tied again to AWS, or excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend. [SEP] However, we expect this ramp-up to positively impact our overall earnings in the coming quarters.","70":"One of the areas where we continue to invest aggressively is in our original content, both in terms of increasing the quantity and quality of what we offer.

We continue to invest in our infrastructure and expand our product lines to better serve our customers. Let's now take some questions from the analysts on the call.","75":"Now moving on to our iPhone sales. [SEP] Our iPhone ASP was $691 during the December quarter. [SEP] This is an increase from the previous quarter and reflects strong demand for our higher-priced iPhone models.","76":"Our team has been working tirelessly to ensure that our products are at the forefront of innovation and continue to exceed customer expectations.

Our team has been working hard to identify the key drivers of this success, and we wanted to share some of our findings with you all today. [SEP] And the used cases that we see in the cloud in many cases happen to be net new workloads, IOT was not driving our server growth traditionally, mobile backend was not driving our servers traditionally. [SEP] What we've discovered is that the cloud is driving new workloads that we hadn't previously seen in our server growth. IOT and mobile backend are two of the biggest examples of this.

We believe that these areas have enormous potential for expansion and we are committed to investing in them. [SEP] Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. [SEP] In addition to increasing our workforce, we have also been focusing on developing new technologies and innovative solutions that can help us stay ahead of the competition. We are confident that our strategic investments will pay off in the long run and enable us to continue delivering exceptional value to our customers.","173":"We have seen an increase in revenue for the past quarter.

[SEP] As a result, we've adjusted our sales projections for next quarter.","175":"We noticed a decline in iPhone sales in fiscal year 2016. [SEP] And so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 2016 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S as a point, it had further to fall. [SEP] This affected our overall revenue and gross margin for the year.","176":"Thank you for your question.

[SEP] This range takes into account potential fluctuations in market conditions and changes in consumer demand.","181":"During this quarter, we focused on revamping our advertising strategies and exploring new opportunities to increase revenue.

[SEP] As we continue to navigate this uncertain time, we'll remain agile and make changes as needed to ensure we're meeting the changing demands of our business.","187":"We're really focused on our marketing strategy this quarter.

Thank you again for your participation on today's call and for your ongoing support.","192":"We've seen some growth in our e-commerce efforts, but it's important to note that our primary focus remains on connecting people with each other and with the content that they care about. [SEP] But really the vast majority of searches on Facebook are for people, not topics related to retailer e-commerce. [SEP] That being said, we do believe there's potential for us to explore more in the realm of social commerce, particularly as more and more businesses look to connect with customers online. We're keeping an eye on this space and excited to see where it takes us in the future.","193":"Now I would like to turn to our product performance. [SEP] And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. [SEP] We are really pleased with the growth trajectory of our switcher product and we expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","194":"We're now going to move on to discuss our performance in 2018. [SEP] So in a lot of ways, 2018 was about banking the efficiencies of investments in people, warehouses, infrastructure that we had put in place in 2016 and \u201917. [SEP] Looking ahead to 2019, we're confident that we have a strong foundation to continue our growth trajectory.","195":"When looking at our regional performance, we saw some fluctuations throughout the year.

[SEP] So in some places, we\u2019ll \u2013 there will be laws passed and others might be working with regulators and having some structural rules imposed on us like with the FTC settlement; in other areas, it might be self-regulation like around, content and speech in the United States. [SEP] Overall, we recognize that we have a responsibility to operate within the boundaries of applicable laws and regulations, while also upholding our commitment to free expression and an open internet.","197":"We have time for one more question before we wrap up this call.

[SEP] This increase reflects our strong financial position and confidence in our ability to continue delivering value to our shareholders.","202":"We're anticipating some changes in the market in the next quarter. [SEP] I think on any kind of, on a 90-day clock, lots of different things can happen. [SEP] That being said, we're confident in our ability to navigate any challenges that may arise.","203":"We've been closely monitoring the impact of our recent initiatives to improve engagement with our customers. [SEP] So we think that this is going in the direction of building a stronger community and a stronger business over the long term, and we're optimistic about what we're seeing here.

[SEP] Our team has also been working hard to improve our fulfillment process, which has resulted in faster delivery times for our customers.","205":"Our team has been working hard to improve the performance of the Facebook app, particularly when it comes to loading external links. [SEP] Right now for links that are not Instant Articles, it can be one of the slowest parts of the Facebook app. [SEP] To address this, we are implementing new caching strategies and optimizing the way links are loaded. Our goal is to reduce load times for non-Instant Articles links and improve the overall user experience. We will continue to monitor and improve app performance as we prioritize the needs of our users.","206":"Our second quarter earnings report shows a decline in revenue compared to last year. [SEP] And it's the fact that we had a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. [SEP] However, we anticipate a strong rebound in the upcoming quarters with the launch of our new product line and the easing of supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19.","207":"We're now going to shift our focus to advertising revenue. [SEP] Certainly, this quarter we saw that ad load had a much less significant impact on impression growth. [SEP] However, we did see a higher cost per click due to increased competition in certain markets.","208":"We\u2019ve seen tremendous growth in our Azure cloud services this quarter.

[SEP] So, while a lot of the content is still provided by people in a way that we\u2019re not covering costs, we do have a strategy of investing in great content that really starts the flywheel growing \u2013 going and we\u2019ve been pretty pleased, I mean it\u2019s not the biggest effort anyone has, but we\u2019ve had some hits from Tom and Time to Tom and Time to Red Table Talk ,sorry for your loss, and we\u2019re seeing some really nice engagement numbers on these shows. [SEP] Can you speak to any other investments or initiatives you have planned in this area?","211":"We have been focusing on retaining our high-value customers and driving repeat purchases from them.

We've been closely monitoring our customers' behavior and are seeing some interesting trends. [SEP] And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. [SEP] This consistency in spending habits allows us to tailor our business strategy and product offerings to fit the needs and preferences of our customers worldwide. Additionally, it demonstrates the value and appeal of our ecosystem as customers continue to engage and spend within it.","219":"We've seen a lot of speculation in the media about our recent sales numbers. [SEP] I realize that's very different than what some of the, is being written, but the June sales were the highest. [SEP] We believe this is due to a combination of factors, including a successful marketing campaign and increased demand for our products.","220":"Now I'll turn to our financial performance for Q4. [SEP] But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the reaction of customers in Q4, and the bottom line results that we had. [SEP] Looking ahead to 2021, we'll continue to focus on delivering excellent customer service and driving growth in our key markets.","221":"We have seen considerable growth in our customer base this quarter, particularly in the SMB sector.

We are pleased to have them onboard and are actively seeking similar opportunities in the SMB space.","222":"One area of growth for us this quarter has been our expansion into emerging markets.

[SEP] That's why we're investing heavily in our customer service technology and training our staff to provide the best possible service.","225":"We also had several success stories with our advertising campaigns. One particular case stands out as an example of how targeted advertising can yield great results. [SEP] So they invested in carousel ads and only show them when their stores were closed and they turned a $35,000 investment in carousel ads into $2 million in sales which happened precisely when they want it to happen. [SEP] This is just one example of how carefully crafted advertising strategies can pay off. We are constantly looking for ways to optimize our campaigns and drive sales for our clients. Our team is dedicated to delivering maximum value for every advertising dollar spent.","226":"During the quarter, we invested heavily in marketing to drive traffic and sales across all segments.

[SEP] So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL. [SEP] We believe this will provide significant value to our Prime members and continue to strengthen our position in the streaming video market.","234":"We've made some changes to our platform in response to user feedback, particularly around data privacy and user experience. These changes include tighter controls around user data and a redesigned interface that's more intuitive and streamlined. [SEP] And while we don't expect these changes will significantly impact advertising revenue, there's certainly potential for some impact. [SEP] However, we're confident that these changes will ultimately benefit our users and create a better overall experience. Our team is closely monitoring the situation and will make adjustments as necessary to ensure that our advertising revenue remains stable. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our company.","235":"We have seen tremendous demand for our latest product release. [SEP] And in any situation, whether it\u2019s the watch or in the past on iPad or on iPhone, when demand is much greater than supply, it\u2019s difficult to gauge exactly what it is. [SEP] However, we are working tirelessly to increase production and address the supply shortage in order to meet this demand.","236":"Our company has always had a strong commitment to ensuring that our platforms are safe and hospitable for all users.

We also have a strong presence in the enterprise market and are continually expanding our offerings to serve a diverse range of clients.

[SEP] And we have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there as we continue to focus on great offerings through the AmazonGlobal Store, which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. [SEP] In addition to the AmazonGlobal Store, we are also investing in improving our logistics capabilities in China. This includes expanding our fulfillment network and partnering with local delivery companies to provide faster and more reliable delivery options for our customers. We believe these investments will help us capture even more market share in this important region.","247":"Thank you for joining us on the call today to discuss our earnings for the quarter. [SEP] We're not concentrated in any one layer of the stack, which is something we do by design because our vision has always been that we want to of course offer all of these layers, and customers will choose depending on their needs and their scenarios. [SEP] Additionally, we believe this approach helps us to be more flexible and responsive to changes in the market and customer demands.","248":"We have analyzed our projections and taken into consideration the current market conditions. [SEP] We believe that this is the range where we're going to fall within. [SEP] However, we are continually monitoring our performance and making adjustments as necessary to ensure that we meet our targets.","249":"As we have previously mentioned, our focus this quarter has been on improving our small business offerings. [SEP] We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis. [SEP] This represents a 10% increase from last year and shows the continued growth and importance of small businesses on our platform.","250":"We have been closely monitoring the regulatory environment and recent developments.\n- \"We understand that there have been concerns raised about our business practices. [SEP] We're happy to see the recent clarifications and we're happy to operate in any regime.

[SEP] So early days, but I think a lot of potential here. [SEP] We will continue to closely monitor the success of this new venture and make adjustments as necessary to maximize its potential.","252":"Our team is working hard to examine user behavior data and identify areas where we can improve engagement. [SEP] But I think one of the successes you are seeing we\u2019re having right now is that we are helping people move to Stories more quickly because of the lessons we learned. [SEP] We've noticed a significant uptick in Story usage since implementing these changes.","253":"We're seeing tremendous growth in our services business. [SEP] It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product categories, and that is very, very important for the services business. [SEP] As we look ahead, we're confident that this growth trend will continue as we invest in new products and services that meet the evolving needs of our customers.","254":"Our focus this quarter has been on improving our infrastructure and expanding our capabilities. We have been investing heavily in new technologies and facilities to support our growth. [SEP] And so, you've seen that already in terms of the ramp that we have in capital expenditures. [SEP] This increased investment has allowed us to accelerate our expansion plans and increase our capacity in key areas. We are confident that these investments will drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders. As we move forward, we will continue to prioritize strategic investments that support our vision for the future.","255":"When can we expect to see return on investment for this project? [SEP] Others have an 18-month clock. [SEP] Can you clarify what you mean by an 18-month clock?\" \n\nFull statement: \"When can we expect to see return on investment for this project? Can you clarify what you mean by an 18-month clock? Others have an 18-month clock.","256":"Our company has been implementing various cybersecurity measures to ensure the safety of our clients' data. [SEP] In many cases, it starts with advanced set protection of Windows 10 estate. [SEP] Additionally, we have also been investing in training our employees on the latest security protocols to improve our overall security posture.","257":"During the first quarter, our company saw a decrease in revenue from our mobile division. We believe this is due to a shift in the market towards one dominant operating system. [SEP] Now people don't really move between operating systems. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our mobile division's future growth as we plan to release new models in the coming months. Additionally, we are investing in developing software that can be used across multiple operating systems to reach a wider audience.","258":"We've had a number of successful acquisitions over the past few years that have contributed to our overall growth. [SEP] So it's always with the customer experience in mind that we make acquisitions. [SEP] Our latest acquisition is a software company that will enable us to improve our online ordering process and provide customers with greater customization options.","259":"Moving on to our App Store segment, I'm pleased to report that we've seen continued growth in both the number of downloads and revenue generated. [SEP] On a year-over-year basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting and paying on the App Store is growing very, very well. [SEP] This growth has been driven by our expanding customer base, the popularity of our new subscription-based services, and the success of our marketing initiatives.","260":"Our Echo line of products has been a key driver of growth for our company. [SEP] Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, launching the Dot and Tab and Fire TV skills this past year. [SEP] We have also seen an increase in adoption of our voice assistant technology across other platforms and devices.","261":"When asked about the current business performance in China, the CEO responded by highlighting two key factors. [SEP] The other two items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe that our continued investments in the Chinese market will pay off in the long run.","262":"During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our iPhone SE and MacBook Air in both developed and emerging markets. [SEP] And the majority of the iPhone SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured there. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued demand for the iPhone SE and we plan to expand its availability in key markets around the world. In addition, we are continuing to invest in our manufacturing capabilities in the region to support our growing operations.","263":"We had projected a decrease in revenue for the quarter due to market uncertainties. [SEP] And that is exactly what happened in our actual results. [SEP] Our team worked hard to mitigate the impact of these uncertainties and we were able to exceed our revenue target for the quarter.","264":"We've seen some great success in our retail partnerships over the last quarter. [SEP] They\u2019re a kids clothing retailer. [SEP] As we continue to expand our product lines, we see a lot of potential in the children's market, especially with the rise of millennial parents looking for trendy and affordable clothing options for their kids.\" \n\nOverall Statement: \"They\u2019re a kids clothing retailer. We've seen some great success in our retail partnerships over the last quarter. As we continue to expand our product lines, we see a lot of potential in the children's market, especially with the rise of millennial parents looking for trendy and affordable clothing options for their kids.","265":"Despite a challenging economic environment over the past year, I am pleased to report that our company has achieved impressive growth. [SEP] And so, we've been able to grow without the market growing. [SEP] We attribute this growth to our innovative product offerings, strategic partnerships, and continued emphasis on providing exceptional customer service.","266":"Thank you for your question. [SEP] When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. [SEP] In North America, we saw a decline in sales due to the pandemic, however, our sales in Asia increased significantly.","267":"As we move forward, we remain committed to our strategy of delivering innovative products that create meaningful experiences for our users. Our focus is on building devices that seamlessly integrate with our software and services, and make everyday tasks easier and more enjoyable. [SEP] I believe our participation in the phone segment by itself with Windows phones and Lumia phones being there is important, and that's why we picked the three areas where we have differentiation and we want to focus on it. [SEP] Over the past year, we've made great strides in the phone segment, particularly with the release of our latest Lumia line. We're seeing positive results in terms of market share and customer satisfaction, and we believe there's even greater potential for growth in the future. By doubling down on our areas of differentiation, we're confident that we can continue to deliver compelling products that meet the evolving needs of our users.","268":"We have made significant progress in streamlining our product portfolio and focusing on our core businesses. Our efforts are paying off as we have seen positive growth in our key product lines. [SEP] But we're looking at the stuff with increasing rigor now where we organized the company into these product groups, and each product group leader will not just look at the product as one thing, but what are the key three or four or five use cases which often can really be their own product lines on their own, and we go through and we build those out to be world-class. [SEP] This approach has helped us identify new revenue streams and expand our market share. By investing in these specific use cases, we are able to deliver highly differentiated products that address the unique needs of our customers. We are excited about the potential of this approach and are committed to continuing to refine and optimize our product offerings.","269":"Can you give us some insights into any new products or services that the company is working on? [SEP] And then there is a new load hybrid as well which is people are building in fact they're doing AI training job in the cloud but want to deploy the model close to the edge. [SEP] That sounds exciting. Can you elaborate more on the new load hybrid and its potential impact on the market?\"\n\n\"We believe that this new load hybrid will address a key pain point for many of our customers who want to take advantage of cloud-based AI training but also need to deploy the models close to the edge for real-time decision-making. By bringing these two together, we are opening up new possibilities for industries such as autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare.","270":"We understand that there are going to be ups and downs, but we're confident in our ability to weather any storm. [SEP] And again, as I said earlier, we're in the long haul. [SEP] Our focus remains on delivering value to our customers and shareholders for years to come.","271":"We have conducted extensive market research, and we are pleased to announce that our product has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers. We are seeing strong demand in our target market. [SEP] It has a price advantage and the value advantage for customers. [SEP] As a result of our unique advantages, we are confident that we will continue to gain market share and increase our profitability. We are also investing in research and development to further enhance our product offerings and stay ahead of the competition.","272":"During the past fiscal year, we have seen tremendous growth and expansion in our enterprise business. [SEP] I doubt very many people knew that we had $25 billion enterprise business that we quietly built in not too many years [SEP] As we continue to focus on innovation, technology, and strategic partnerships, we anticipate even greater success in this sector in the years to come.","273":"We have seen a significant downturn in our global sales. [SEP] Everything is in Europe. [SEP] Specifically, our focus has been on expanding our operations in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.","274":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith from ABC News. [SEP] For now, the thing that I would leave you with is that people think that Facebook isn't in China at all and that's actually not true. [SEP] Can you provide us with some more details on Facebook's presence in China?","275":"As we talk about our plans for growth and expanding our customer base, we also need to acknowledge the importance of maintaining strong data privacy policies. With recent concerns over data breaches and misleading data practices, it's clear that customers are prioritizing their privacy more than ever before. [SEP] I think it's very important that there is federal privacy legislation. [SEP] Not only would federal privacy legislation help protect customers, it would also create a more level playing field for businesses of all sizes. Right now, larger companies with more resources are able to invest heavily in data privacy, potentially overshadowing smaller players who may not have the same capacity. With a clear set of federal guidelines, everyone would be on the same page.","276":"Our social media platform has seen tremendous growth over the past year and we are very pleased with the progress we have made. [SEP] I think now more than 100 million people follow different hashtags, which is a way that people can form ad hoc communities, and that \u2013 it all goes towards the overall mission that we have as a company of helping to build community and bring people closer together. [SEP] We believe that hashtags have played a significant role in facilitating connections among our users and we will continue to invest in this feature to enhance the community-building experience.","277":"Our smartphone sales have seen a steady increase over the past quarter, with the demand for 5G-enabled devices driving this growth.\n- We have also noticed that our mid-range smartphones are gaining popularity among consumers who want value for money without compromising on performance.\n- Our focus on innovation and user experience has helped us retain our loyal customer base, while also attracting new customers. [SEP] And between the upgraders and the switchers that we see, and the first-time buyer category is still out there too in several countries, including some that you may not think there is, there's still a sizable base in some. [SEP] To cater to these diverse consumer needs, we are constantly expanding our product portfolio and investing in R&D.\n- In addition to this, we are also exploring partnerships and collaborations to strengthen our market position and expand our reach.\n- Overall, we are optimistic about the growth potential in the smartphone industry and believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.","278":"Could you provide us with more detail on your shipping options for Prime members? [SEP] And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. [SEP] Do you anticipate any changes or expansions to your delivery offerings in the near future?","279":"We've been working hard to improve our product offerings for the last year. [SEP] Whereas now, we actually have specific value, which is in fact very valuable to those first line workers. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a significant increase in adoption and usage among our target audience.","280":"Our digital media division has been performing quite well over the past quarter. [SEP] When you look at the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to grow very quickly. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a 40% increase in the number of subscribers compared to the same time last year.","281":"Our Q2 earnings report shows a 10% increase in revenue compared to the same quarter last year. [SEP] We typically reduced channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2, but this year, we did not see the same level of reduction due to strong demand. [SEP] As a result of this strong demand, we anticipate increased production and shipment of our newest iPhones in the upcoming quarter.","282":"We'd now like to address the impact of the new accounting standard on our financial results. [SEP] So on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change. [SEP] However, we anticipate that this will be offset by an increase in ad revenue and other sources of revenue.","283":"One of our key strategies this year has been to expand our presence in Greater China. [SEP] We\u2019re now at 21 in Greater China and we\u2019re on track still to achieve 40 stores by the middle of next year. [SEP] This growth is being driven by strong consumer demand in the region.","284":"We have been closely monitoring our user engagement rates as well as our ad revenue figures. As always, we strive to provide the best possible experience for both our users and our advertisers. [SEP] We're focused on all of these metrics and working hard with third parties and with our advertiser to get those metrics right. [SEP] We have also recently implemented new strategies to improve our targeting capabilities and increase overall ad performance. We are confident that these efforts will lead to positive results in the coming quarters.","285":"We've seen strong growth in our messaging platform over the past quarter. [SEP] And because messaging really started from the place of people communicating one to one with each other and is now adding all these other uses, it's just a lot of investment and a lot of different functionality that needs to get added. [SEP] However, we believe this investment in our messaging platform will lead to continued growth and provide new revenue opportunities for the company.","286":"Our next question comes from the line of Sandra from Bernstein Research. [SEP] For WhatsApp, it's the biggest countries on WhatsApp. [SEP] Can you elaborate on which countries specifically are driving the growth for WhatsApp and how you plan to continue expanding in those markets?","287":"Our social media platform and mobile app have both seen significant growth this quarter. [SEP] Both have over 1.2 million monthly actives. [SEP] We attribute this growth to our continued focus on user engagement and improving the user experience.","288":"We are focused on providing our customers with the best shopping experience possible. [SEP] That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to, and also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. [SEP] Our goal is to ensure that our customers receive the products they want, when they want them, and at the most convenient location possible.","289":"As we continue to innovate and improve our products, we are also looking at new ways to protect our users' privacy and security. [SEP] And one of the ways that we're talking about decentralization is through end-to-end encryption in messaging. [SEP] We believe that end-to-end encryption is crucial in providing our users with a secure and private messaging experience, and we will continue to invest in this technology to ensure its effectiveness.","290":"Now I'd like to talk a bit about our latest product launch. [SEP] This is a small closed beta with 23 brands and for us that's obviously a very small number. [SEP] However, we believe this closed beta will provide us with valuable insights to improve the product before we roll it out to a wider audience.","291":"During the last quarter, we have been focusing on investing in our media advertising business, which continues to be a key growth area for us. We remain committed to providing a diversified range of advertising solutions to our customers and partners while expanding our global reach. [SEP] It\u2019s still early in this space, but we\u2019ve done a few things with IMDb TV, Live Sports, things like adding more inventory through Fire TV apps, and as I said IMDb TV, adding more OTT video supply through Amazon Publisher Services or APS integrations and streamlining access for third party apps and really just making it easier for advertisers to manage their campaigns and provide better results. [SEP] As we move forward, we will continue to invest in our media advertising business, and our goal is to provide the best-in-class solutions that deliver measurable results for our advertisers. Our team is dedicated to optimizing our advertising products, strengthening our relationships with our partners, and growing our audience across all platforms. We look forward to sharing more updates on our progress in the coming quarters.","292":"We've been seeing tremendous growth in our messaging and e-commerce platforms, and we're excited to continue exploring ways to improve the user experience and drive even more engagement. One of the ways we're doing this is by focusing on the natural interactions between businesses and consumers. [SEP] Similarly, to some of the things we've done in Messenger, some of the things we've done in Marketplace, we're watching for what is the organic activity between businesses and consumers, and then we're building products to enhance and enable that organic activity. [SEP] For example, we recently introduced new features in Marketplace that make it easier for sellers to connect with potential buyers and manage their listings. We're also experimenting with augmented reality tools in Messenger that allow businesses to showcase their products in a more interactive and immersive way. Overall, our goal is to make it as easy and seamless as possible for businesses to reach their target audiences and for consumers to find what they're looking for.","293":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith with ABC Investment Group. [SEP] We continue to invest very heavily in our systems both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of then making Amazon a better place for customers to buy and increasingly not only vendor sales, but also third-party merchant sales. [SEP] Can you provide more details on how these investments are impacting your bottom line?","294":"Now let's take a look at the impact this will have on our overall profitability. [SEP] As I said earlier, it's worth 40 basis points. [SEP] This may not seem like a lot, but every basis point counts in our industry and we're pleased to see this positive impact.","295":"Our advertising revenue continues to grow, and we've seen positive results from our recent initiatives. [SEP] In the U.S. and Canada on Facebook, we're seeing strength in sort of nonvideo feed engagement. [SEP] We're also pleased with the progress of Instagram and WhatsApp in these markets, with both platforms showing increased user engagement. However, we need to remain vigilant in addressing issues around data privacy and security to maintain the trust of our users and advertisers.","296":"We\u2019ve been talking a lot about our bookings growth rate and the trends that we\u2019re seeing there. And as we have mentioned previously, we do expect some lumpiness in that bookings number. [SEP] That means it shows up in bookings and again not in the unearned balance in the same way, and so you will see as we go forward and you are already starting to see it more volatility in this number, not just based on the way we\u2019ve traditionally talked about it which is the movement of the expiration base but also in some of these larger and longer term commitments by what we now think of not just as customers but these are really now partnership relationships that we have where to your point we're co-collaborating to help customers be successful as they build their digital future. [SEP] I think that\u2019s a really important distinction because it speaks to the fact that these are not just transactional relationships. These are long-term partnerships where we are really invested in our customers\u2019 success. And as we continue to build out these partnerships and work more closely with our customers, I think we\u2019ll see that reflected in our financial results.","297":"We've had questions from investors about our position on collecting sales tax. [SEP] We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitution and permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly. [SEP] We believe that a clear and consistent framework for collecting sales tax across states would benefit not only our company, but also our customers and the broader economy.","298":"Our company has experienced a lot of growth in the past few years, and we continue to see that trend emerging. We are pleased with our results and excited to share them with you today. [SEP] And I think it takes real composure as a leader to scale something to many x where it was just a few years ago and build up the organization and be able to continue pushing the products forward every day to be able to do that. [SEP] We are very proud of our team and their dedication to our products. Our future looks bright as we continue to innovate and push boundaries in our industry. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.","299":"We've had some strong revenue growth this quarter, thanks in part to our recent acquisition. [SEP] And I think sometimes it's harder for us to measure exactly what a revenue synergy means. [SEP] However, we're confident that the synergies from this acquisition will continue to drive revenue growth in the coming quarters.","300":"Our social media strategy has been a key driver in increasing our online presence and reaching new audiences. We've been closely tracking the engagement metrics on our social channels and we're seeing great results. [SEP] There are a lot of people who are just sharing content socially, right, which is great for us because it drives more engagement and brand recognition. [SEP] We're considering implementing more incentives for users who share our content, such as giveaways or exclusive access to new products. Overall, we're thrilled with the impact of social sharing on our business and plan to continue investing in this area.","301":"We've received a lot of questions about our strategy for improvement in performance and utilization across our business. [SEP] And Keith, the thing I would add in addition to Satya's comment about investing and investing materially to make these improvements in performance and utilization, we've always had and seen, as you all have gotten a bit used to, it can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and so we expect a sequential growth into Q3, which is really just a movement that happens from time to time. [SEP] However, we recognize that there are still challenges ahead and we are prepared to continue making investments to address them.","302":"Our company has always been at the forefront of innovation and we pride ourselves on continuing to push boundaries in our industry. [SEP] But overall, when I look at what is it that we need to get done is innovate on what is a fundamental architectural advantage to where the world is going. [SEP] We are confident that by staying true to our values and constantly striving to improve, we will maintain our position as a leader in the market. Thank you for joining us on this call.","303":"Now let's take a closer look at our regional performance for the year. [SEP] It was a reasonably consistent Kash, there was not a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier although in two of our largest geos, the U.S. and Germany they did have very good years in particular in Q4. [SEP] Overall, we are optimistic about the growth potential in these regions going into the next fiscal year.","304":"We have a clear strategy in place for the next quarter. [SEP] And that\u2019s how we want to make sure we make progress [SEP] We will continue to monitor our progress closely and make adjustments as necessary.","305":"Our video platform has been growing rapidly over the past year, with more and more creators joining our community every month. We're seeing a lot of engagement and excitement around our content, and we want to find ways to reward our creators for their hard work. [SEP] And what we would like to transition that more to over time and what an increasing amount of the content is, is revenue shares for ads shown in the videos. [SEP] We believe that revenue sharing is a fair and sustainable way to support our creators, and we plan to expand this program in the coming months. Our team is also exploring other monetization options, such as product placement and sponsorships, to further support our creators and ensure the long-term success of our platform. Overall, we're very optimistic about the future of our video business and look forward to continuing to grow and innovate in this space.","306":"Our company has always prioritized innovation and staying ahead of industry trends. [SEP] Innovation is accelerating, not decelerating. [SEP] We plan to continue investing in research and development to ensure we remain at the forefront of our field.","307":"We've seen incredible demand for our products across the board, and we're very pleased with the overall performance of our business this quarter. Of course, one product that has been a standout for us is the iPhone SE, which has been very well received in the market. [SEP] But when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the iPhone SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us because we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. [SEP] We're also seeing strong loyalty among our existing iPhone customers, which is a testament to the quality of our products and the strength of our brand. Overall, we're very optimistic about the future of our business and remain focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences to our customers. Thank you all for joining us today.","308":"Now, moving on to our financials. [SEP] We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. [SEP] This excess cash allows us to invest in our business and explore opportunities for potential acquisitions in the future.","309":"Can you talk a little bit about the drivers behind the increased revenue for this quarter? [SEP] And so I do think it was premium driven as opposed to sort of a price driven in particular. [SEP] But overall, we were pleased with the growth and we are optimistic about the direction of the market moving forward.","310":"In terms of our services business, I am happy to report that we saw strong growth during the fourth quarter. [SEP] It's the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal 2017. [SEP] We attribute this growth to the continued adoption of our cloud-based solutions, as well as our focus on expanding our customer base and introducing new services and features.","311":"I want to talk a bit about our pricing strategy and how it's been working for us. [SEP] And so we've had 48 price decreases since we launched. [SEP] But despite these decreases, we continue to see strong sales growth and customer loyalty.","312":"As we move forward, there are a lot of opportunities for growth and improvement. [SEP] So there's a lot of different fronts that we're working on. [SEP] However, our main focus right now is on streamlining our operations and optimizing our supply chain to reduce costs.","313":"Our platform has proven to be a valuable tool for political campaigns looking to reach voters in a more targeted way. [SEP] Ben Carson ran 240 different ads targeted at different audiences, and so we're starting to see candidates use our platform to communicate, to advertise and to share. [SEP] As we move closer to the election, we expect to see even more candidates utilizing our platform to reach their supporters and potential voters.","314":"We've been receiving some questions about our future plans and how we plan to compete with our competitors. [SEP] I don't see that from a market point of view or \u2013 and certainly not from an iPhone point of view. [SEP] However, I do believe that we have some exciting new products in development that will continue to keep us competitive and innovate our industry.","315":"One of the biggest priorities for us this year was to migrate a significant number of users onto our new platform. [SEP] And there's always lumpiness as well as increased deployment that happens once the users migrate, and we'll continue to track that and we'll continue to disclose those numbers as they come along. [SEP] However, we are confident in the benefits this migration will bring in the long term, including improved user experience and increased efficiency.","316":"Our company has been at the forefront of technology innovation for over a decade. Our latest release has surpassed all expectations, with sales exceeding projections by 30%. [SEP] And it is ultimately I think going to change the way that we communicate and live and work in addition to how we play games. [SEP] As more consumers adopt our product, we expect to continue to see growth and profitability. Our team is already hard at work on the next iteration, which we anticipate will push the boundaries even further. Thank you for your continued support.","317":"Now, let's turn to our intelligent cloud segment. This has been an area of focus for us over the past year and we're seeing strong results. [SEP] Now, if you think about some of the dynamics that we've been going through in the intelligent cloud segment, in particular the way I tend to think about that, as you've seen, we're now 20% growth this quarter in that server and product services KPI, 17% on a constant currency basis, and are sort of confident that you should continue to see that, as I said, into Q4 and then into FY 2019 as well. [SEP] We're continuing to invest in this segment, particularly in our Azure and Dynamics 365 offerings. We believe these investments will drive sustained growth in the coming years. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making in the intelligent cloud and look forward to updating you on our continued success in future earnings calls.","318":"I am pleased to share that our quarterly earnings report exceeded expectations.\n- Despite the challenging market conditions, our team has been working diligently to drive growth.

[SEP] And I mentioned this before that 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda related content that we take down, we're removing before any person flags it to us. [SEP] We've invested heavily in our technology and partnerships with law enforcement to proactively identify and remove this type of content.","320":"Our team has been hard at work to ensure that our customers are satisfied with our products and services. [SEP] And then the most important thing is that the customers' success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year. [SEP] We are committed to investing in our customers' success to secure a long-term partnership and growth for both parties.","321":"We have seen significant growth in advertising revenue on our platforms over the past year. As we continue to focus on monetizing our user base, we are exploring opportunities to increase ad load on our various features. [SEP] But we do have opportunities we think to increase effective ad load on Stories, where Instagram Feed and Facebook Feed are \u2013 we think the opportunities are much more limited to increase ad load going forward [SEP] However, we are also mindful of maintaining a positive user experience, and we will be cautious about putting too many ads in front of our users. We believe that finding the right balance between monetization and user experience is critical to our long-term success.","322":"We've been investing heavily in our technology and platform over the past year. Our team has been working tirelessly to improve user experience and build features that our customers have been asking for. [SEP] But I do think at this point, we're pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we're building, and making it an open platform I think is a big is a big step forward. [SEP] We're seeing strong uptake and engagement from our user base, and we're confident that our technology will continue to position us as a leader in the industry. Our focus on open architecture and flexibility will also enable us to stay nimble and adapt to changing market conditions.","323":"Our iPhone X was highly anticipated by customers and we saw a surge in pre-orders leading up to its release. [SEP] We were able to reach supply\/demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1 and this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2. [SEP] Our team worked tirelessly to ensure we were able to meet the high demand for the iPhone X and we are pleased with the results.","324":"Our focus this quarter has been on understanding our users' behavior and improving their engagement with our platform. [SEP] Private sharing, both with Stories and direct messaging, are growing incredibly quickly on Instagram, and I think that those are both very exciting areas for development of products as well. [SEP] We have already started exploring potential partnerships to enhance the private sharing experience on Instagram and we'll continue investing in this area.","325":"Looking back at our humble beginnings, we've come a long way since our first year in business.

Our recent product launch has been met with great success, and we have secured several partnerships with major industry players.

[SEP] And as far as the guidance we have given at close in terms of what to expect, for example around EPS impact, those are things that we'll stay committed to. [SEP] However, we will continue to monitor market conditions and business trends and make any necessary adjustments to our guidance as we move forward.","330":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the usage of our messaging apps. Our WhatsApp and Messenger platforms continue to be the most popular messaging apps globally, and we are seeing strong growth in both platforms. [SEP] But what we found in general is that if you look at some of the markets that are strongest for both of them, they can each grow in those markets, and as messaging has become more affordable and more reliable for people, the volumes of messaging have just gone through the roof in terms of what people want to do. [SEP] As a result, we are investing heavily in our messaging infrastructure to ensure that we can handle the increasing volumes of messages being sent daily. We believe that messaging will continue to be a critical part of our business, and we will continue to innovate and invest in this area to meet the evolving needs of our users.","331":"Now, I'll turn it over to our CFO to discuss our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] In terms of what is driving the deceleration, it's a combination of factors, and I think I outlined those in my commentary. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects and are actively pursuing initiatives to drive revenue in the upcoming quarters.","332":"We're happy to report that our Prime membership continues to grow steadily.

[SEP] And so you've got \u2013 the risk there is of course the headwinds that we talked about on the ad targeting front and how that will play into U.S. growth as well. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and continue to deliver value to our shareholders,\" added the CFO.","341":"During this quarter, we saw a significant increase in sales for our Dynamics 365 product line.

We've been closely monitoring the growth of mobile usage, and it's been quite impressive. In fact, we've seen some significant shifts in consumer preferences and behaviors that bode well for our company.

[SEP] To capitalize on this opportunity, we're continuing to invest heavily in our mobile capabilities, including developing new mobile applications and features that will improve the user experience. We believe that by staying ahead of the trends and meeting our customers' evolving needs, we can continue to capture market share and drive long-term growth for our business.","344":"We are pleased to report that our company has seen significant growth in the past quarter. [SEP] And obviously that all translates into the revenue growth as well across all of the marketing solutions, talent solutions, and sales solutions. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the future and believe that our continued investment in technology and talent will drive even further growth.","345":"Thanks for the question. Absolutely, Marketplace is a really important part of our business and our overall ecosystem. We continue to see strong engagement from our users, and we're committed to investing in this area. [SEP] And in Marketplace, we definitely are going to focus on some of the areas that you talked about including jobs is already a pretty meaningful focus where a lot of people do find jobs and business is less jobs through Facebook. [SEP] That being said, we recognize that there is still a lot of work to be done, and we're constantly looking for ways to improve the experience for our users. One area where we've seen some really promising results is in our efforts to combat fraud and scams on the platform. We'll continue to prioritize these types of initiatives going forward.","346":"We've been seeing a lot of exciting developments in our Windows 10 market segment in recent months. [SEP] But I don't want to diminish the signal because the signal is demand is very good for Windows 10 and upgrades in modern hardware when they realize the benefits. [SEP] We're confident that as more consumers and businesses become aware of the benefits, demand for Windows 10 and hardware upgrades will continue to grow.","347":"Our competitors charge significantly higher prices for access to their content libraries. [SEP] You think - think about the quality of content that you get for 499, and it's amazing. [SEP] We believe this unbeatable value proposition is a major factor driving subscription growth.","348":"Our company had a strong presence in China last quarter, with significant growth in sales and market share. [SEP] iPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of China last quarter. [SEP] The success of iPhone X in China has exceeded our expectations, and we are confident in our continued growth in this important market.","349":"Our team has been actively monitoring the market trends and consumer behaviors to understand what our customers want and need.

[SEP] We\u2019re starting to see some benefits from that. [SEP] We expect these benefits to continue throughout the next quarter as well.","351":"We have another question online from a shareholder who asks, \"Can you discuss your share buyback strategy and what factors you consider when deciding to repurchase shares? [SEP] So for me, while I appreciate the spirit behind the question, for us we have felt a necessity to do that for years, as a part of total shareholder return and our commitment to do that. [SEP] In addition, we have seen a positive impact on our EPS growth as a result of these buybacks. As always, we will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy and make decisions that we believe will drive long-term value for our shareholders.","352":"Our sales have been increasing steadily year over year, and we are pleased with the overall growth of the company. However, we have noticed that our sales cycle is taking longer than it used to. [SEP] I think that the major catalyst for that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of total sales around the world than they were at one time and so I think that some are lengthening. [SEP] We have implemented several strategies to address this issue, including increasing our marketing efforts and improving our sales techniques. Additionally, we are exploring new markets and partnerships to further diversify our revenue streams. Despite this challenge, we remain confident in our ability to continue growing and expanding our business.","353":"Our sales team has been focused on expanding our customer base in key markets. [SEP] We design a great product and we make it priced at a great value. [SEP] As a result, we have seen a significant increase in both revenue and market share over the past quarter.","354":"We have seen some decline in our revenue over the past few quarters due to the natural expiration of certain long-term contracts. [SEP] They get replace by new contracts at current levels and therefore the protection that is provided to us by our hedging program diminishes over time. [SEP] As a result, we are constantly evaluating our hedging strategies and looking for new ways to mitigate risk and ensure profitability in the long-term.","355":"One of the main challenges we are currently facing as a company is the saturation of the market in which we operate. [SEP] And so I think that is another factor that presents risk in our ability to continue to grow ARPU. [SEP] However, we remain committed to finding innovative ways to enhance our product offerings to stay competitive in the industry.","356":"In terms of our streaming video service, we've seen some great growth in our Prime membership numbers. [SEP] So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally we doubled the number of \u2013 our Prime members doubled the number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year. [SEP] We believe this is a result of our continued investment in high-quality original content and exclusive deals with top studios and networks.","357":"Our team has been focused on improving our mobile advertising offerings for some time now,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] So we're taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and making it even better.

[SEP] We had features and new technology and these products when we launch and tend to have higher cost structures than the products what they replaced. [SEP] However, these initial costs are expected to decrease as production scales up and these products become fully integrated into our existing operations.","361":"Our focus on cloud-based solutions has been a key driver in this growth, and we are constantly looking for ways to improve and innovate in this space. [SEP] Overall, we are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Office 365. [SEP] We are optimistic about the continued trajectory of Office 365 and believe it will be a major contributor to our overall revenue growth in the coming quarters.","362":"We saw strong growth in our Office and productivity platform in the last quarter. [SEP] The very first thing and I think Satya even mentioned it in its most direct in SMB is moving from buying a copy of Office, which was a very static concept to the idea where you could buy Office and frankly get all the benefits that those who used to deploy servers used to get only with IT departments of their own. [SEP] This shift has enabled us to reach new customers and grow our revenue in the SMB segment.","363":"We're now going to take a question from the audience. [SEP] But I think all marketers have the opportunity to do video, and that's pretty exciting, including SMBs who would never be able to hire a film crew and buy a TV ad. [SEP] So, John, do you think this could be a game-changer for small business marketing?","364":"We are thrilled to report strong earnings for the quarter, with a revenue increase of 20% compared to the same quarter last year.

I'd first like to discuss our Q1 revenue. Overall, we saw a strong quarter with total revenue reaching $10.2 billion.

Thank you for joining us today.","369":"We've seen strong sales growth in our Apple ecosystem products this quarter.

We're also looking to expand our reach in new markets and improve our customer service offerings. [SEP] We're continuing to invest in a number of key areas, hiring engineers to drive the three, five, and 10-year priorities.

We're already seeing positive results from our engineering hires, and we're confident that these investments will position us for even greater success in the years to come.","371":"During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our cloud services and Office 365 subscription-based productivity suite.

Overall, we're confident in our ability to drive growth across our key businesses.","372":"As we wrap up the first quarter, let's dive into the financial performance of the company. [SEP] We saw some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective. [SEP] This can be attributed to several factors, including new product launches and increased marketing efforts in key markets.","373":"We are seeing a significant shift in the marketplace towards cloud computing. [SEP] And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10. [SEP] Our latest offering aims to make this transition even smoother for our clients, providing advanced security and data backup features.","374":"Our international expansion efforts have been successful in recent years. [SEP] We launch Prime Now in the U.K. [SEP] We believe that the launch of Prime Now in the U.K. will help us to continue growing our presence in the region.","375":"Can you speak to the supply chain situation for your different product segments? Are there any areas of concern or potential bottlenecks? [SEP] And what I would say is I think there we feel good about the supply in the Commercial segment and the Premium Consumer segment, which is where the vast majority of our revenue is in OEM. [SEP] However, we are keeping a close eye on the availability of certain materials and components, particularly in the aftermarket and accessories segments. We anticipate potential challenges in those areas but are working proactively to mitigate any supply chain disruptions.","376":"Moving on to our regional performance. While we delivered strong growth in the U.S. and Canada, we remained challenged in our European and rest of world markets. [SEP] Obviously, it's probably, everybody realizes this, but the big disparity between the U.S.-Canada growth rates versus the other regions like Europe and the rest of world are the currency headwinds, which had a very significant impact to the year-over-year advertising growth rates in those regions. [SEP] However, we continue to focus on diversifying our revenue streams and investing in local content to drive growth in those regions. We are confident in our ability to navigate these currency headwinds while also capitalizing on the numerous growth opportunities in our business.","377":"Our focus on user experience has been the driving force behind the success of App Store.

[SEP] In the past quarter, App Store generated a record-breaking revenue of $22 billion, reflecting the trust and loyalty of our users towards our platform.","378":"Our commitment to innovation and improving our products has been a major focus for the company over the past year. [SEP] A good example of this is in fact even the rewrite of complete revamp I would say of Dynamics. [SEP] We believe that these improvements to Dynamics will better serve our customers and help drive growth for the company in the future.","379":"We've noticed that our revenue has increased significantly due to our focus on our core products and services. However, we want to make sure that we're providing value across all of our offerings. [SEP] You can also see that on the other services we're not doing that. [SEP] We've identified areas where we can improve in terms of customer satisfaction and engagement. We're currently evaluating our strategy for these other services and exploring options to better align them with our overall goals for the company.","380":"We have seen increased usage of our Cortana virtual assistant, particularly in the home setting. Our team has been working hard to improve and expand upon its capabilities. [SEP] In terms of Cortana and home, I think it's probably important. [SEP] As we continue to invest in AI and machine learning, we believe Cortana will play an essential role in our vision for connected homes and smart devices. We are committed to making Cortana even more intuitive and seamlessly integrated into our users' daily lives.","381":"Our company has seen tremendous growth in the past year, but we are committed to building on that success going forward.

Over the past year, we've seen a shift in user behavior with more people spending time on social media and messaging apps. [SEP] We've had I think a lot of success moving advertisers to where people already are. [SEP] We believe this shift represents a key opportunity for us to drive revenue growth by monetizing these platforms.

We've seen increased demand for cloud-based solutions as more organizations transition to remote work models. [SEP] So when somebody moves to Office 365, their graph, their people, their relationships with other people inside the organization, their work artifacts all move to the cloud. [SEP] This migration to the cloud has also opened up opportunities for us to provide additional services, such as advanced analytics and machine learning. As more customers adopt our Office 365 platform, we expect to see continued growth in this area. We remain committed to investing in our cloud offerings to provide the best possible experience for our customers.","386":"Our team has been working hard to improve our ad solutions for small businesses. We believe that by providing more transparency and measurement capabilities, we can better serve our customers and help them grow their businesses. [SEP] From a small business perspective, being able to close the loop on ads and transactions, we think, is just going to make it so that it's more valuable to have a presence on our services, and buying ads is going to be more valuable. [SEP] In addition to improving our ad products, we are also investing in tools and resources to help small businesses succeed on our platform. For example, we recently launched a small business resource center that provides tips and best practices for using our advertising tools. We are committed to helping our customers succeed and believe that these efforts will drive long-term value for our business.","387":"We've been very thoughtful about the types of workloads that we are pursuing.

Looking ahead, we will continue to strategically diversify our workloads to further improve margins.","388":"Our sales have been steadily increasing over the past quarter,\" said CEO John Smith. \"We've seen a significant uptick in customer satisfaction surveys as well.

[SEP] Our continued investment in technology and innovation has allowed us to remain competitive in the market and expand our offerings.","391":"Our strategy for expanding into this new market has been progressing steadily over the last few quarters. We have been investing heavily in new resources, including hiring additional staff, developing new products, and building relationships with local suppliers. [SEP] And so we are still insignificantly in the build mode there, and so don't think of the penetration as anywhere near sort of a mature penetration. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about the potential for growth in this market. Our research indicates that there is still a large untapped opportunity for our products, and we will continue to invest in this region to capture that potential. We expect to see continued growth in the coming quarters as we ramp up our efforts and further establish our presence in this market.","392":"During this quarter, our focus has been on strengthening our commitment to privacy and data protection.

[SEP] In addition to this, we have also been closely monitoring the emerging regulations surrounding privacy and are committed to staying compliant with them.","393":"During the current quarter, we have seen a shift in consumer behavior towards larger screen sizes. [SEP] It's longer than an iPhone, probably between an iPhone and a PC. [SEP] As a result, we are focusing on the development of larger devices that can better meet the needs of our customers. This new product that we are working on is longer than an iPhone, probably between an iPhone and a PC. We believe that it will be a game changer in the market and we are confident that it will drive growth for our company in the coming years.","394":"Now turning to our financial results for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] When you look at our revenue guidance, we are guiding to a sequential decline between 26% and 30%. [SEP] This decline is primarily due to a decrease in demand for our products and services in certain markets.","395":"We are thrilled to report our recent marketing campaign's success, which utilized a multichannel approach to reach our target audience. [SEP] They had a 16.5% lift in ad recall and then Nielsen\u2019s study showed a nearly 20% incremental reach on Facebook versus TV. [SEP] This data reinforces our belief in the effectiveness of social media advertising and encourages us to continue diversifying our ad spend.","396":"As we look to the future, there are a lot of exciting opportunities for growth in our industry. However, there are also some challenges that we need to address in order to capitalize on these opportunities. [SEP] And this impedance is something that I've always dreamt of how do we go forward. [SEP] I believe that addressing this impedance will be key to our success in the coming years, and I'm excited to work with our team to find innovative solutions. With the right approach, I'm confident that we can overcome this obstacle and continue to thrive as a company.","397":"As we continue to enhance our online inventory, we want to address recent concerns regarding our selection.

[SEP] We are pleased to report that the issue has been resolved and our entire selection is now available for purchase.","398":"We've had some questions about how we're thinking about the macro environment and specifically inflation and supply chain constraints. [SEP] However, I think you can tell from the numbers that Luca is talking about just on the currency side and that's before thinking through the affect that price increases can sometimes have on the business over a period of time, it's clear that the economic piece is large. [SEP] That said, we're confident in our ability to navigate through these challenges and continue to drive strong performance.","399":"So, looking ahead to the fourth quarter and the holiday season, what is your outlook on sales and revenue? [SEP] What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. [SEP] Our marketing team has been hard at work preparing for the busiest shopping time of the year and we've seen positive early indicators from our pre-holiday promotions.","400":"Now let's talk about our pricing strategy and margins for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] I would say the margins \u2013 our margins expectations are that we will price competitively and continue to pass along pricing reductions to customers both in the form of absolute price reductions and also in the form of new products that will in effect cannibalize the old ones. [SEP] We anticipate this approach will lead to a slight dip in short-term profits, but will ultimately solidify our position as a cost-conscious and innovative leader in the market.","401":"When asked about the growth potential of AWS, the company's CEO responded [SEP] It's not only dependent on us, it's also dependent on the companies that are adopting Amazon, so there's a - or excuse me, AWS. [SEP] But we certainly believe that our continued investment in AWS, and the increasing demand for cloud services in general, positions us well for continued growth in this area.","402":"Our retail expansion strategy has been successful over the past year. [SEP] And we have 12 bookstores now. [SEP] We plan to open an additional 5 bookstores in the next quarter to further increase our presence in key cities.","403":"We've been testing this new feature in a few select markets over the past few months. [SEP] And similarly, based on the feedback that we're getting, I would expect that we'll be rolling that out pretty widely across the world soon as well. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to monitor user engagement and feedback as we roll out this feature globally.","404":"Our international expansion efforts have been successful, particularly in China where we continue to see strong growth. [SEP] This is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese-language pages. [SEP] We are constantly looking for ways to improve the customer experience and expand our global reach, and this offer has been very well-received by our Chinese customers.","405":"We're now going to open the call up to questions from analysts. The first question comes from John Smith at ABC Bank. John, please go ahead.\"\n\n\"Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I had a question about the transformation you just mentioned. Could you give us some more detail on what's driving that, and what kind of progress you're making? [SEP] Overall, the approach we have taken for multiple years now is to transform everything that we do inside the company, whether it\u2019s the product creation, how we\u2019re organized in the R&D, how we think about breaking down any silos and category definitions we may have had in the past, how we think about even marketing and the marketing approach, and then of course even with the go to market, and this transformation is ongoing. [SEP] Sure, John. Thanks for the question. This transformation is really driven by a few things. First, we're seeing a lot of disruption in our industry, with new competitors emerging and customer needs evolving rapidly. We need to be agile and flexible to respond to those challenges.\"\n\n\"Second, we believe there are a lot of opportunities to improve the way we operate internally, and to create a more cohesive and collaborative culture across the company. That's why we're breaking down silos and rethinking how we approach everything from R&D to marketing.\"\n\n\"Third, we want to be more customer-focused in everything we do. By transforming our approach, we believe we can better understand what our customers need and how best to serve them. It's an ongoing process, but we're already seeing some positive results in terms of innovation, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.","406":"Our website traffic has seen consistent growth over the past quarter. [SEP] I think we have been and continue to be a great place for people to browse and discover. [SEP] We are exploring new partnerships and initiatives to enhance the browsing experience for our customers.","407":"Our strategy has always been to offer a premium console alongside a more affordable option to increase our market share. [SEP] because we always wanted that halo effect of the premium console driving even the lower-end console, because that creates the sockets for gaming for us. [SEP] And, we've seen that the success of our premium console has indeed driven sales of our lower-end console, which is great news for us.","408":"When discussing our iPhone sales for the quarter, I also want to address the pricing of our devices. [SEP] And we've tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone but may have a more limited budget. [SEP] We believe that everyone should have access to the best technology, and we will continue to work towards making our products more accessible to a wider audience.","409":"We have received a lot of inquiries from investors and analysts about the potential for more advertising in our Video product. [SEP] On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose not to do that right now. [SEP] Our focus right now is on improving the user experience and increasing engagement, and we believe that flooding our Video product with ads would be counterproductive to those goals.","410":"Our sales for this quarter have exceeded expectations. [SEP] We think we have \u2013 we're attractive both to customers and to sellers and we like our position. [SEP] We are constantly looking for ways to improve our platform and enhance the experience for both our customers and sellers.","411":"During the last quarter, we launched a new product line hoping to attract a wider audience and diversify our revenue streams. [SEP] And we got a lot of feedback from people saying that's not what they wanted. [SEP] As a result, we decided to pivot our strategy and focus on developing a more targeted solution that addresses our customers' specific needs.","412":"In order to improve our delivery times and efficiency, we've made several investments in our infrastructure. [SEP] It's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network. [SEP] The result has been a significant reduction in shipping times and an increase in customer satisfaction.","413":"Now I'd like to turn to our performance in the emerging markets. [SEP] Our emerging market performance during the quarter was very strong. [SEP] We saw strong growth in our key markets, particularly in Asia, where our sales increased by 12 percent compared to the same period last year.","414":"Our advertising revenue grew by 25% year-over-year, driven by increased engagement across our platforms and growth in the number of advertisers. [SEP] And so as we work on rolling out more Ad Breaks, and we are rolling out slowly, we're really focused on finding ways to help marketers measure the right things, and that's a very important focus for the company going forward. [SEP] We're also continuing to invest in improving the user experience, balancing the needs of advertisers with providing value to our community.","415":"We noticed a slight fluctuation in our revenue this quarter. Can you explain what may have caused this? [SEP] There\u2019s a couple of things, but in general it is almost always mix shift. [SEP] Can you provide some specific examples of mix shift impacting our earnings this quarter?","416":"We have seen a significant increase in sales over the past quarter, exceeding our expectations. Our marketing strategies have been successful in reaching our target audience. [SEP] and so we feel very good about that.

We are confident in our ability to sustain this growth and provide value to our shareholders.","417":"In Q2, we made some significant updates to our platform to better serve our publisher partners. We added new features for ad targeting and improved our reporting capabilities. [SEP] What we're hearing from publishers is that this is a good opportunity and they're pleased with the extensions we're making [SEP] As a result of our efforts, we've seen an increase in the number of publishers joining our network. We're confident that these extensions will continue to benefit both our publishers and advertisers alike.","418":"Now, let's turn our attention to the growth in our core platform. [SEP] So we're continuing to see good growth in the Facebook ecosystem with 11% DAU growth. [SEP] This growth is largely due to the introduction of new features and products, as well as increased user engagement across all demographics.","419":"As we look ahead to the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond, I wanted to touch on our plans for investment. We believe that by investing in key areas of our business, we can position ourselves for sustainable, long-term growth. [SEP] And so the net is we\u2019re investing a lot across the board in our infrastructure, in our products, on partnering with different companies. [SEP] We're also focused on optimizing our operations to ensure that we're using resources as efficiently as possible. This includes exploring new technologies and operational processes that can streamline our workflows and reduce costs. Overall, we're confident that these investments will pay off in the form of stronger revenue growth and increased profitability over the long term.","420":"Our team has been working tirelessly to innovate and develop unique features for our platform.\n- We have conducted extensive market research and have identified gaps in the current offerings of our competitors. [SEP] We believe we have position that doesn\u2019t exist on any other platforms. [SEP] This has allowed us to attract a diverse range of users and be the go-to platform for their needs.\n- We are continuing to invest in our platform to stay ahead of the competition and maintain our leadership position in the industry.\n- Our efforts have resulted in strong user engagement and revenue growth for the company.","421":"Our company has seen significant growth over the past year, driven by our focus on expanding our higher-level services. [SEP] And so we're very bullish about what can happen in the higher-level services and we'll continue to build on that piece. [SEP] We're also exploring new partnerships and acquisitions to further strengthen our position in this area.","422":"During the third quarter, we focused on increasing sales through a variety of strategies. [SEP] We\u2019ve committed, we did sales overlays. [SEP] As a result, we saw a significant boost in revenue and are confident in our ability to continue this positive trend moving forward.","423":"Our team has been closely studying the market trends over the past quarter. [SEP] We haven't seen enough upgrade cycles to really establish a pattern as yet. [SEP] However, we anticipate that there will be a noticeable uptick in upgrades in the coming months as consumers start to embrace the latest technology.","424":"We've seen steady growth in our grocery business over the past year, and that's largely due to our acquisition of Whole Foods. We made significant investments in their operations and marketing, and we're starting to see the benefits of that work. [SEP] So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. [SEP] However, we know that the grocery industry is highly competitive, and we're not resting on our laurels. We're continuing to innovate and improve our offerings, both in-store and online, to stay ahead of the game. We're confident that our partnership with Whole Foods will be a key driver of growth for years to come.","425":"Moving on to our financial performance for the quarter, I am pleased to report that we achieved strong revenue growth across all of our business segments. [SEP] The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex-FX. [SEP] This growth was primarily driven by our continued expansion into new markets and the successful launch of several new product lines.","426":"Our Q3 results showed strong improvement compared to the previous quarter, with sequential gains of 800 basis points. This was largely due to the impact of our recent cost-cutting measures and increased demand for our products. [SEP] And so we are lapping that, which sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis points sequential gain. [SEP] Looking ahead to Q4, we anticipate a more moderate rate of growth as we continue to navigate challenges related to the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. However, we remain optimistic about our long-term prospects and are committed to investing in innovation and strategic partnerships to drive continued success.","427":"Now, let's take a closer look at our sales performance over the past few quarters. [SEP] We're really pleased with that and if you look at the sort of the cycle, which I'll define as Q1, Q2, Q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid single digits and on an average weekly sales point of view, and of course double digit on the ASP and so I think it's really healthy. [SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to focus on driving growth through strategic marketing initiatives and product innovation.","428":"Looking at our Q2 revenue, we brought in $1.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year. [SEP] And keep in mind that this $99 was partially offset by $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange. [SEP] However, our earnings per share came in at $0.85, which is below our guidance due to the aforementioned foreign exchange impact and some supply chain disruptions.","429":"In terms of our e-commerce business, we continue to see strong growth in our marketplace and Prime offerings. [SEP] FBA becomes very important as well and we've talked about some of the tailwinds we see there, and sort of the linkage between marketplace and Prime that FBA provides. [SEP] We're also investing heavily in fulfillment infrastructure to keep up with the demand for FBA, and we believe this will continue to drive growth in our e-commerce segment.","430":"We've seen great success in our advertising campaigns over the past quarter, especially in terms of driving sales. Our team has been working hard to create engaging and impactful ads that resonate with our target audience. [SEP] Obviously, if people learn about things through our ads and then close the loop all the way to purchase, it's very strong for proving ROI, it also helps as a measure that return as well. [SEP] We're looking forward to continuing to refine our advertising strategy and measure the impact of our efforts on the bottom line. Our team is committed to delivering value to our customers and shareholders, and we believe that our advertising campaigns are an important part of that equation.","431":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our products over the past quarter. [SEP] So we are very excited about that.

John, you may go ahead with your question.\n\nJohn:\n\nYes, thank you. I was wondering if you could expand a bit on your video offerings. What kind of opportunities do you see there? [SEP] So I think excited about that, other opportunities we've been working with in ads, video for a bit longer period of time have been things like our sports offering, some of the live sports that we've done, things like Thursday Night Football, really like the success that we've seen on those and been learning from that and looking forward to pursuing more opportunities to engage and serve with customers with those types of video offers, but also take some opportunity to monetize with the advertising. [SEP] Bob:\n\nThanks for the question, John. Yes, we're definitely seeing some exciting opportunities in video. One area that's been particularly successful has been our sports offering. We've had some great results with live sports events, such as Thursday Night Football, and we're looking to build on that success with more engaging video content. And of course, we see a lot of potential for advertising revenue in this area as well, so we're eager to explore those opportunities further.","433":"Our goal is to continue to innovate and offer our users new and exciting ways to engage with our platform.

[SEP] We're also excited to explore advertising opportunities within these longer forms of video content.","434":"Our production team has been working tirelessly to increase our output and meet the high demand for our products. We've invested in new machinery and streamlined our processes to make this possible.

We believe that our commitment to quality and customer satisfaction will continue to drive our success in the coming quarters. Thank you for your continued support.","435":"Our cloud services segment saw strong growth this quarter, driven primarily by our Azure platform.

[SEP] However, we continue to see strong demand for Azure from enterprise customers and expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","436":"We are pleased with the progress we made in 2016 and we believe we are well-positioned for continued success in the coming year. Our focus remains on driving growth and delivering value to our shareholders. [SEP] And so that's our plan going into 2017.

Additionally, we are implementing new cost-cutting measures that we believe will further strengthen our financial position. Overall, we are optimistic about our prospects for 2017 and we look forward to sharing further updates with you in the coming months.","437":"Our latest marketing campaign has been met with some mixed results, but we're optimistic about its potential. We've had some initial success in terms of increased website traffic and social media engagement, but we're eager to see if this translates into actual sales. [SEP] And right now, we're using the Lift tool to continue to measure their sales for the 30 and 60 days beyond the campaign to see what happens. [SEP] Of course, it's still early days, and we know that there are always a lot of variables at play when it comes to marketing. Regardless of the final outcome, though, we believe that it's important to stay on top of our data and use it to inform our decision-making going forward. We're excited to continue exploring the possibilities of the Lift tool, and we're confident that it will help us make more informed and effective marketing choices in the future.","438":"As we look to the future of our company, we are focused on enhancing the customer experience in every way possible.

And the time spent is simply a means to achieve those ends. [SEP] That's why I tried to stress up front that time spent is not a goal by itself here. [SEP] So, as we move forward, I just want to make sure everyone understands that we're not trying to be busy for the sake of being busy. We're trying to be productive and efficient in everything we do. And if that means we can get the same results in less time, that's great. Our ultimate goal is to deliver value and make a positive impact for our customers and our stakeholders.","440":"Our overall sales performance for the quarter was strong. [SEP] And traffic \u2013 which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell \u2013 traffic was up 27% year on year.

[SEP] It's a really good way to drive engagement. [SEP] Our team is constantly exploring new ways to enhance user engagement and improve the overall user experience.","442":"We have identified several segments within our portfolio that we feel have potential for growth and profitability. [SEP] Those, we believe, are attractive long-term investments. [SEP] We plan to strategically allocate more resources towards these investments in the coming quarters to capitalize on their long-term potential.","443":"We've seen a significant increase in our device trade-in program over the past quarter. [SEP] Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the -- many, many people do want to trade-in their current phone. [SEP] In fact, we've had to allocate more resources to handle the influx of trade-ins, but it's a positive sign that our customers trust us to provide them with the latest technology.","444":"Our team has been closely monitoring our platform's user engagement metrics throughout the quarter. [SEP] I think in terms of impression growth, you're going to have more opportunities in Stories, probably more opportunity on Instagram, but good revenue growth opportunities in both places. [SEP] With these projections in mind, we're confident in our ability to continue driving value for both our users and our shareholders in the coming months.","445":"Now moving on to our financial results for the quarter.

[SEP] But we are confident in our ability to manage and control these expenses going forward.","451":"Now I'd like to turn to our Office 365 product. We are very pleased with the performance of this segment and the growth it continues to deliver.

Additionally, we are exploring new features and functionality to enhance the user experience and drive adoption of the platform.","452":"We saw a significant increase in our advertising revenue this quarter.

[SEP] Additionally, we've seen a surge in interest from international markets, which has also boosted our paid account numbers.","459":"We have noticed some concerns regarding our supply chain and inventory management in certain locations. [SEP] I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers.

[SEP] By acquiring these various solutions, we believe we can not only increase our revenue streams, but also provide a more comprehensive experience for our clients. Plus, having access to Microsoft's top-of-the-line offerings will give us a competitive edge in the market.","467":"We are now going to shift our focus to discuss our progress in the enterprise segment. As you all know, this has been a key area of growth for us in recent years, and we believe there is still huge potential for us in this market. [SEP] It's about the selling motion of E3 and E5 that we talk about. [SEP] We have been working hard on improving our selling motion for these products in particular, as we believe there is significant demand from our enterprise customers.

[SEP] And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections. [SEP] This targeted approach has led to a significant increase in engagement and conversion rates among our Prime members, and we plan to continue utilizing this data-driven strategy moving forward.","471":"We are closely monitoring global demographic trends as they could significantly impact our long-term growth strategy. [SEP] I think it's clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. [SEP] With this in mind, we are exploring ways to expand our operations in India to capitalize on this demographic shift.","472":"Can you give us some insight into the current state of demand for your services? [SEP] Overall, I think some of the trends that you've referenced, whether it's Tier 1 workloads or serverless or even complete data center migrations, all of that is happening. [SEP] That's great to hear. Can you talk a bit more about how your company is positioning itself to capture these opportunities?\" \n\nOverall, I think some of the trends that you've referenced, whether it's Tier 1 workloads or serverless or even complete data center migrations, all of that is happening. We're seeing an increasing interest in cloud technologies from both large enterprises and small businesses alike, and we've been working hard to ensure we're well-positioned to meet this demand. With our recent investments in our infrastructure and our partnerships with leading cloud providers, we believe we're well-equipped to capture these opportunities and continue driving growth for our business.","473":"Our focus remains on building a strong user base and ensuring that our platform is stable enough to handle an increase in advertising. We've seen great results from sponsored content and sponsored lenses, and we're exploring other ways to monetize the platform. [SEP] In terms of direct ads in messaging, we're taking that very slowly. [SEP] We're aware that introducing too many ads too quickly can lead to a poor user experience, and we don't want to lose the trust of our users. Our team is focused on finding a balanced approach to advertising in messaging, and we're confident that we'll find a solution that works for both our users and our advertisers.","474":"Our mobile hotspot device sales continue to exceed expectations. [SEP] And because it allows the mobile carriers to not have to have the whole supply chain and sales and retail that they have otherwise, they're able to sell the data plans for on average about 10% less than they would be able to otherwise, which actually is allowing more people to get on the internet in the first place because they can now afford data plans. [SEP] We anticipate further growth in this area as more people seek affordable internet access options.","475":"We're constantly investing in our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities,\" said the CEO during the earnings call. [SEP] Similarly, aside from the conversational and linguistic understanding, there's a whole thread of the work that we're doing on visual understanding. [SEP] This has allowed us to improve our product recommendations and personalization features, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention,\" added the chief technology officer.","476":"We have been closely analyzing market trends and customer preferences to identify new opportunities. [SEP] And so therefore, we look at that as an expansion opportunity, so we take that. [SEP] We are confident that investing in this expansion will not only increase our market share but also drive long-term growth for the company.","477":"Thank you for joining us today on our earnings conference call. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for our company, and I'd like to take this opportunity to share some of the highlights and key takeaways. [SEP] All of these have been multiple years of hard work, and clearly there is momentum across the board, and that I think is what you are seeing and we are excited about this quarter's execution and performance, and I think it bodes well for what we do in the future, but the key is for us to recognize that this is about the sort of long-term commitment to a big opportunity in making sure that you line up your execution against that. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to position ourselves for success in the coming years. We believe that we are well-equipped to capitalize on emerging trends and leverage our core competencies to drive sustainable growth. As always, we remain focused on creating value for our shareholders, customers, and employees, and we are grateful for your continued support. Thank you.","478":"We recently received some concerning feedback from our customers about a particular product feature. It was not until we conducted a study on the matter that we realized there was indeed an issue. [SEP] When that study was shared with people internally, and we have that culture where people do studies and share things, and we're really glad because that helps surface issues, we immediately conducted our own research using the full data. [SEP] The results from our study showed the same thing as the external study. We quickly came together as a team to brainstorm solutions and implement a plan of action. Ultimately, this experience has strengthened our commitment to our customers and our culture of transparency and continuous improvement.","479":"We recognize the importance of providing a safe and positive experience for our users on Facebook. As part of our efforts to improve this experience, we have been closely monitoring and addressing the issue of objectionable content on our platform. [SEP] So there's an increasing focus on objectionable content, right, and a lot of unfortunate things, right, that people share on Facebook. [SEP] To address this problem, we have been investing heavily in both human and technological resources to detect and remove inappropriate content. We also work closely with law enforcement authorities and other organizations to ensure that our platform is not used for unlawful activities. We are committed to maintaining a high level of integrity and responsibility in the use of our platform, and we will continue to develop new strategies to make Facebook a safe and enjoyable space for all our users.","480":"We are pleased to report record-breaking revenue for the past quarter. [SEP] With Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, Band 2 and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL. [SEP] We continue to see strong demand for our products and are optimistic about their future performance in the market.","481":"We are pleased to report another successful quarter for our company. [SEP] As you think about commercial intent in Facebook versus Instagram, there's so much activity on both. [SEP] Our teams have been working hard to build upon this success and continue to explore opportunities for growth in both platforms.","482":"Could you speak to the specific ways in which you are monetizing within News Feed? [SEP] And a lot of this happens within the current News Feed product. [SEP] But we are also developing other products and features that we believe will drive additional revenue growth.","483":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. We're excited to discuss our performance this quarter and our strategy moving forward. [SEP] I think broadly, when we look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories, so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. [SEP] Additionally, we're committed to enhancing the customer experience through seamless checkout, fast shipping, and exceptional customer service. We believe that by prioritizing these key areas, we will continue to attract and retain loyal customers and drive sustainable growth.","484":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in user activity on our platform. [SEP] And the reason we think people are so active is it's just really expensive and hard to have your own mobile site or your own even webpage. [SEP] We believe that by providing businesses with an affordable and easy-to-use platform, we can continue to attract and retain active users.","485":"Can you talk more about your cloud strategy and how you're integrating different products and services under one umbrella? [SEP] When you look at what we're trying to get done between Azure, we don't really see these themes across Azure or 365, Dynamics 365, and also the things that we're doing with Xbox Live, for example, all billed as one cloud infrastructure and a set of rich services in the cloud. [SEP] Can you elaborate on how this approach is benefiting your customers and driving growth for the company?","486":"As we reflect on our first quarter performance, I want to address any concerns about the launch of our new product line. [SEP] In the first quarter with any new kind of product, you would always have learning and these sorts of things. [SEP] Despite some initial setbacks, we have already implemented several changes to improve customer satisfaction and are confident in our future success with this product.","487":"During the quarter, we made significant investments in our augmented reality (AR) technology. [SEP] We put a lot of energy on AR removing very fast. [SEP] Through our efforts, we were able to increase the speed at which AR elements are removed from the user's screen, resulting in a smoother and more seamless user experience.","488":"We've seen an increase in demand for our product in certain markets. [SEP] So we're investing on that front. [SEP] We believe that these investments will allow us to capture even more of that demand and further increase our market share.","489":"Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of John Smith from XYZ Investment Bank. [SEP] Just on the OpEx question, I think the key is that we're investing in our near, mid-term, and long-term priorities, so while we expect some near-term pressure on margins, we're confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth and profitability over the long run. [SEP] We're seeing strong demand for our products and solutions across all of our markets, and we remain committed to investing in innovation, technology, and our people to drive continued success.","490":"Our second quarter results have shown strong growth across all aspects of our business. We're particularly pleased with the success of our subscription services. [SEP] iCloud is a service that continues to grow very strong double digits, and that's also helping. [SEP] We expect iCloud to continue to drive growth in the coming quarters as more and more users choose to store their photos, documents, and other files in the cloud. Additionally, we're working on new features and enhancements to make iCloud even more valuable to our customers.","491":"We now have some updates on this matter. [SEP] Just on the second question on the subscription services, we\u2019d said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018. [SEP] As we move into 2019, we have seen a positive impact from these changes and expect continued growth in our subscription services.","492":"During the past quarter, we saw a significant increase in demand for our latest smartphone models. [SEP] There's tons of innovation left at the phone. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to continue to provide cutting-edge technology and features that will keep our customers satisfied and loyal.","493":"We have been discussing the company\u2019s financial position and our plans for growth. [SEP] That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint. [SEP] I believe we can find ways to optimize our expenses and continue investing in our strategic objectives.","494":"Looking ahead, I think there are some positive factors that will benefit our industry. Firstly, there's been a lot of discussion lately around the need for increased investment in infrastructure. Secondly, we've seen some improvements in the job market, and consumer confidence is starting to pick up. [SEP] I also think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure and on creating jobs, which is fantastic [SEP] Overall, I believe that these trends will support continued growth in our business over the coming months. However, we also need to be cautious and remain vigilant about the potential impact of any changes in government policy or macroeconomic conditions. We'll continue to closely monitor these developments and adjust our strategy as needed to ensure we remain on track to deliver value to our shareholders.","495":"During the quarter, we faced challenges with supply chain disruptions and increased competition in certain markets. [SEP] So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our retail segment and are exploring new opportunities for expansion into international markets.","496":"Moving on to our gaming segment, I'd like to highlight some of the key developments that have been taking place in the industry over the past few years. [SEP] I would say from a Gaming perspective, one of the bigger changes that has happened in the last, I would say, couple of years is one, of course the vibrancy of the Xbox Live network across the PC and the console and now increasingly even on the phone because of titles like Minecraft. [SEP] This has really opened up new opportunities for us, as we explore ways to leverage this network to drive engagement and revenue across our portfolio of games. Overall, we're very optimistic about the gaming market and see a lot of potential for growth in the years ahead.","497":"Now, let's talk about our financial performance over the past quarter. [SEP] Q4 was a little depressed is how as we think about it due to some of the restructuring; Q1 is a little bit higher. [SEP] However, overall, we are optimistic about the year ahead and believe that our strategic initiatives will lead to sustained growth in the long-term.","498":"Can you provide any updates on the status of our new product launch? [SEP] You know very well the launch timing is different. [SEP] But can you give us any insight into why the launch timing has changed?","499":"Can you expand on how you view the adoption of this technology within the industry? [SEP] But I think broadly, I don't see any difference than say, what we used to see or what we still see on our server or any other technology adoption curves. [SEP] So you're confident in the growth potential of this technology?","500":"Our user base continues to grow at a steady pace, and we're seeing more and more engagement on our platform. [SEP] and we think that's very promising for our ability for people to use this platform to make those connections that will ultimately drive business opportunities. [SEP] In addition, we're actively exploring new partnerships and integrations that will further enhance the value of our platform for users.","501":"Our company has experienced strong growth in the first quarter of this year. [SEP] We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. [SEP] These increased investments are necessary to support our expansion into new markets and to improve our technology infrastructure.","502":"As we look to the future of our business, we recognize the need to innovate and adapt in order to remain competitive. [SEP] We've already started down this path. [SEP] Our initial efforts have yielded promising results, and we plan to continue investing in this area moving forward.","503":"We have seen a shift in consumer behavior over the past quarter. [SEP] And as I mentioned, it\u2019s one of the factors driving an increasing inventory. [SEP] However, we anticipate a decrease in inventory once these new products are launched and consumer demand picks up.","504":"Our revenue growth this quarter was driven by several key segments, including... [SEP] Direct response, SMBs who have uploaded 1.5 million videos and have both organic and paid in the last month, and developers. [SEP] We see tremendous potential for continued growth in these areas, and are actively investing in resources and partnerships to support these customers. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our ability to maintain this momentum and deliver strong results for our shareholders.","505":"Now, let's delve deeper into some of the user engagement metrics we saw during the quarter. [SEP] Pages are engaging in this, and some of the trends that Dave just talked about for just a lot of video behavior across the platform. [SEP] As a company, we're committed to staying at the forefront of these trends and delivering the best possible user experience on our platform.","506":"Looking at our Q2 results, we are very pleased with the growth in revenue and earnings for the company. [SEP] And so lots of positives there. [SEP] However, we are keeping a close eye on market trends and potential challenges in the coming months.","507":"Can you talk a little more about your customer base and the operators you're working with?\"\n- \"How are you approaching customer acquisition in different regions? [SEP] We're only working with one operator currently in part of the country. [SEP] Are you considering partnerships with other operators in other parts of the country?\"\n- \"What steps are you taking to expand your reach and increase your customer base?\"\n- \"Do you have any plans to diversify your partnerships and work with multiple operators?","508":"Our Q3 financial results exceeded expectations and we're excited to share some updates on our upcoming initiatives. [SEP] We\u2019ve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, we\u2019re looking forward to our re:Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees. [SEP] Additionally, our team is working hard to innovate on behalf of our customers and we anticipate continued growth and success in the coming year.","509":"Next, I'd like to touch on some of our recent developments in the product line. [SEP] There is a second experience called Video Home, which we started talking about earlier in the year. [SEP] We've seen strong interest in Video Home from customers, particularly those looking for a more immersive viewing experience.","510":"We have seen impressive growth in our enterprise business segment over the past quarter. [SEP] And finally, the enterprise business is not to be underestimated [SEP] With continued investments in our enterprise solutions, we are confident that this segment will continue to drive our overall growth in the future.","511":"We've seen significant growth in the adoption of our new product offerings over the past quarter. Our team has been working tirelessly to improve our technology and better communicate the benefits to our customers. [SEP] But they became much more pervasive and much communicated, I think much wider with the September announcements. [SEP] As we continue to expand our reach and improve our products, we expect to see even greater uptake in the coming months. Our innovative approach to the market is resonating with customers, and we're confident in our ability to deliver strong results going forward.","512":"We know that people come to Facebook not just to connect with friends and family, but also to find and engage with communities that share their interests. [SEP] Hundreds of millions of people already tell us that the groups that they're a part of on Facebook or at least a few meaningful ones are the most important part of their social experience. [SEP] And as we continue to invest in building tools for these communities, we're seeing incredible engagement and growth in group participation on our platform.","513":"Now I'd like to turn the discussion to our e-commerce business. As you all know, we've had significant growth in this segment over the past few years. [SEP] Certainly one of the things that we've talked about its most, that\u2019s notable is fulfillment by Amazon. [SEP] We've seen tremendous success with this program, particularly with Prime members. We plan to continue to invest in and expand our fulfillment network to support this growth.","514":"Our company has been closely monitoring global markets and consumer behavior to identify and respond to trends. [SEP] I had mentioned Japan, but also even in this country even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time. [SEP] However, we have seen a resilience in demand for our products and we remain optimistic about our future growth prospects.","515":"We've noticed a decline in revenue per license (RPL) for non-Pro original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). [SEP] And so overall while it did have an RPL impact, which does explain along with mix shift, the minus 13% in non-Pro OEM versus the PC license growth that we saw, I think really Satya covered the actual logic to that in terms of overall ecosystem health as we feel quite good about. [SEP] We're confident that our continued focus on ensuring a healthy ecosystem will result in long-term success for our company.","516":"Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we anticipate some challenges as we navigate the current economic climate. Our team has been working diligently to mitigate potential risks and capitalize on opportunities. [SEP] But at this point in time, we see that Q2 is the toughest compare. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our strategy and the strength of our products. We will continue to focus on driving growth and delivering value to our customers.","517":"We have seen significant growth in our customer base this quarter, with a 25% increase in new sign-ups compared to the same period last year. [SEP] And we think it's a combination of all these offerings that really are the strength of our business and explains why we can continue to grow. [SEP] In addition, we are continually investing in research and development to enhance our products and services, and we are confident that we can sustain our growth trajectory for the foreseeable future.","518":"We have seen strong growth across all our business segments this quarter. [SEP] But in general, my view is very positive in terms of how things are going, and that positive view is obviously factored in our guidance as well. [SEP] We continue to invest in new technologies and innovations to further drive our growth in the upcoming quarters.","519":"We've been really focused on understanding our users better and creating a more personalized experience. One of the challenges we've encountered is that many analytics tools make assumptions about how users behave online. [SEP] They basically assume that you are one person on one of device, and we know that's not true. [SEP] That's why we've invested heavily in developing our own data infrastructure and analytics capabilities. We want to be able to accurately track user interactions across all devices and channels. By doing so, we can create a more holistic view of our users and make better decisions about how to engage with them.","520":"We\u2019ve seen steady growth in sales throughout the year, with a particularly strong showing during the holiday season. [SEP] It\u2019s a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth and holiday season, that\u2019s very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in sales as we expand our product offerings and continue to attract new customers.","521":"I want to take a moment to address concerns about the security of our platform. As you all know, data privacy and security have been hot topics in the tech industry. I want to assure our investors and users that we have taken significant steps to ensure the safety of our platform. [SEP] And in each of these \u2013 going back to 2016, we were \u2013 we have a very big security team that was focused on security around even the 2016 election and we found hacking and phishing attacks that the Russian government was trying to do, and we notified the right people about those. [SEP] Since then, we have continued to invest heavily in our security infrastructure and technologies. We have implemented advanced threat detection systems and increased our collaboration with law enforcement agencies and security experts. As a result, we have been able to prevent numerous attempts to compromise our systems and protect our users' data.","522":"We often coordinate with our sister company on certain projects and initiatives. [SEP] But as you say they're separately run and they can meet at different points and sometimes at certain vendors perhaps that may get out of hand are get out of sync. [SEP] However, we are aware of the potential for miscommunication or misunderstandings between the two companies. We have implemented measures to ensure that communication channels are clear and both teams are aligned.","523":"We are really pleased with the progress we've made so far in terms of the new product development. We're tracking well against our timelines and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. [SEP] And then the next stage after that which is really the enterprise deployment, which as Satya mentioned, we expect in the second half of the year. [SEP] This enterprise deployment is a key milestone for us and we believe it will generate significant growth in the coming years. We're already seeing strong interest from our customers and we're working closely with them to ensure a smooth transition. Overall, we're confident about our prospects for the second half of the year and beyond.","524":"We've seen some great success in certain regional markets that we've been targeting in recent months. [SEP] Those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and the 6 Plus, because of the screen size, is doing extremely well. [SEP] As we continue to build momentum in these areas, we're optimistic about seeing continued strong growth for our devices in the coming quarters.","525":"Our marketing team has been very successful in increasing brand awareness and driving customer traffic to our dealerships. [SEP] You see an ad and you drive a car off a lot. [SEP] We will continue to invest in targeted advertising campaigns to reach new customers and grow our market share.","526":"Now, let's talk about our recent advancements in Managed Services. [SEP] And even take something like EMS, which is a service you could say in the past we participated with Active Directory, but we, and some amount of system center. [SEP] But today, with the emergence of Azure Resource Manager, we can provide customers with a much more streamlined and effective solution for managing their EMS environments.","527":"We've been steadily expanding our operations over the past year, and I'm pleased to report that we're making great progress towards our goal. [SEP] It's not that we're going to crack every market at once, but in sum I think we're definitely getting there. [SEP] Of course, we still have a long way to go, and there are certainly going to be bumps on the road ahead. But overall, I'm confident that we're on the right track.","528":"Our company had a strong Q2, with revenue increasing by 10% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] and so we were very happy about that [SEP] We plan to use the profits from this quarter to invest in new technology and expand our product offerings in the coming months.","529":"Our strategy for growing our subscriber base continues to be successful. [SEP] But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new ways to enhance the value of the Prime membership, such as exclusive access to live events and premium customer service.","530":"Our efforts to educate our customers about the benefits of our new product and our sales team's hard work have contributed to this growth. [SEP] So that shows real growth people understanding they need to do it differently, but we\u2019ve still got a pretty long way to go, and we are seeing good results. [SEP] However, we must continue to stay vigilant and identify areas where we can improve to sustain this growth in the long term.","531":"We've seen great success with our international expansion efforts in the past year. Our presence in Europe and Asia has been particularly strong. [SEP] It's growing faster outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S. [SEP] We plan to continue investing in our global markets as we see significant growth potential there. In fact, we anticipate that our international revenue will surpass our U.S. revenue within the next two years.","532":"We received a lot of questions in the Q&A portion of our last earnings call about our infrastructure strategy. Today, I wanted to provide an update on our thinking around this area. [SEP] And then in terms of infrastructure itself, as again I said, there's people who are tiering, even applications people who build hybrid applications where the storage could be even on premise in some cases, but the mid-tier and the web and the mobile back ends are in the cloud. [SEP] We believe this hybrid approach is the best way to balance the advantages of cloud computing with the security and control that comes with keeping some data on-premise. We plan to continue investing in infrastructure that supports this hybrid model and delivers the best possible user experience for our customers.","533":"Our video advertising platform has been gaining traction with small and medium businesses all over the world. We have seen a significant increase in the number of businesses using our platform in the past year. [SEP] Over 1 million SMBs have posted videos and done really small ad buys around them. [SEP] This is a testament to the effectiveness of our video advertising platform in helping SMBs grow their businesses. We will continue to improve our platform to meet the evolving needs of our customers and stay ahead of the competition.","534":"We have received feedback from our customers that our tools could be more user-friendly. [SEP] I mean, I think as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of tools. [SEP] This is a priority for us as we want to make sure our customers have the best experience possible when using our platform.","535":"Looking ahead to next quarter, we are expecting some changes in our market and customer base. [SEP] I tend to think about that as we'll have significant revenue growth in that segment. [SEP] Of course, there are always risks and uncertainties in any market, but we feel confident in our strategy and our team's abilities to navigate them.","536":"Now, let's turn to our product performance and market share. [SEP] And compared to the industry peers, we're obviously gaining share with Windows Server, on SQL Server, and pretty much all of our management and security products as well. [SEP] We believe this is a clear reflection of our focus on innovation and meeting the evolving needs of our customers.","537":"We've seen a significant increase in our video ad revenue this quarter. [SEP] But as consumer engagement with video has continued to grow, that creates more and more of an opportunity for video ads. [SEP] In fact, our research shows that consumers are more likely to retain and recall information from video ads compared to other forms of advertising.","538":"During the past quarter, we've seen some incredible growth in our smartphone division. Our flagship product, the iPhone X, continues to be one of our best sellers. [SEP] And so it's iPhone X was number one, but we had several in the top. [SEP] Our research and development team is working feverishly on new innovations that we believe will excite our customers even more. We anticipate continued success in the near future, and we're committed to delivering products that exceed expectations.","539":"We have seen success in our expansion into international markets, and we plan to continue this growth strategy moving forward. This has been a significant driver of our revenue growth in the past year. [SEP] And so I would continue to expect to see us do it. [SEP] Additionally, we have been working on improving our supply chain efficiency and reducing costs in our production process. These efforts are expected to positively impact our profit margins in the coming quarters. Overall, I am confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results for our shareholders.","540":"We had a strong quarter, with revenue exceeding our expectations and expenses well within our target range. Our team worked tirelessly to execute on our strategic initiatives and deliver value to our customers. [SEP] And so the sum of all that, I feel great about the results. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to maintain this momentum and achieve our long-term goals. We are continuing to invest in key areas of the business, such as R&D and sales and marketing, to capture new opportunities and drive growth. Thank you to all our stakeholders for their continued support and trust in our vision.","541":"Our focus has been on expanding our global market reach in order to increase our revenue streams. [SEP] We did announce a region in India. [SEP] Our new region in India has a lot of growth potential and we are excited to see the opportunities that arise from this expansion.","542":"We've been discussing potential market expansion opportunities.\"\n- \"Our team has been exploring various options for growth. [SEP] And we don't really have a specific target there. [SEP] However, we are keeping an eye on industry trends and will make a move if it makes strategic sense.\"\n- \"In the meantime, we will continue to focus on optimizing our current operations.","543":"Our team has conducted extensive research on the Indian market and we believe it presents significant growth opportunities for our company. [SEP] We are investing in India. [SEP] Our investment in India includes opening new offices, hiring local talent, and forming strategic partnerships with local businesses to better understand and serve the needs of the Indian market.","544":"Now let's move on to our latest product offerings and updates. [SEP] I think, as you saw in the release, there are some new devices that take advantage of the underlying service that we think will be really convenient for sellers and interesting for device makers. [SEP] We are confident that these new devices will help fuel revenue growth for us in the upcoming quarters.","545":"We have made a strategic decision to discontinue one of our product lines. [SEP] And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers. [SEP] However, we anticipate this decision will lead to greater profitability in the long term.","546":"We've had a lot of demand for our new product line. [SEP] So we're glad to have that problem. [SEP] It means we need to ramp up production to keep up with orders.","547":"Our investments in India have shown promising results and we are excited about the growth potential in this market. We have seen significant improvement in our sales and revenue streams since expanding our operations in India. [SEP] So we are very encouraged, as I said last quarter in India, and continue to invest there very heavily. [SEP] With our continued investment in India, we expect to see even greater growth in the coming quarters. Our focus remains on expanding our market share and strengthening our presence in key regions throughout the country. Overall, India is a critical market for us and we are committed to driving long-term success in this region.","548":"Our team has been working tirelessly to expand our reach and strengthen our market position. We're excited to share with you the progress we've made in the past quarter toward achieving these goals.

[SEP] So it was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes. [SEP] Our partnership with these startups has allowed us to improve our products and services and attract new customers.","708":"We've had a few questions come through about the recent change in our financial statements, so I want to take a moment to address that. [SEP] I do want to point out it's not just an accounting-related change. [SEP] This change reflects a shift in our business model that we believe will better position us for future growth.","709":"We have been in a legal dispute with one of our major suppliers over pricing for the past year. [SEP] Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. [SEP] Our legal team is confident in our case and we believe the courts will rule in our favor.","710":"We have been closely monitoring our user engagement metrics over the past quarter. [SEP] So there's lots that we are working on on engagement that continue to drive time spent. [SEP] Our team is also exploring new features and partnerships to further increase user engagement on our platform.","711":"As we look at our sales figures for the past quarter, we see a strong trend towards the adoption of mobile devices in enterprise settings. Our iPad sales to enterprise customers have grown significantly in the last year, and we are optimistic about the opportunities in this space. [SEP] The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce. [SEP] We believe that there is significant potential to increase adoption of iPads among enterprise customers, and we are exploring a range of strategies to encourage this. One key challenge we have identified is that many enterprises are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce, often only to senior executives or field staff. We are working to understand the reasons behind this trend and to develop solutions that will make it easier for companies to embrace iPads as a standard tool for their employees.","712":"Now turning to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] When you look at our overall growth, our growth is very broad-based. [SEP] We saw growth across all regions and business segments, with particularly strong results in our international markets.","713":"We are seeing a shift in consumer behavior as more and more people are accessing our platform on mobile devices. [SEP] And obviously that will impact both, I think, the quality of the experience in terms of the ads they get and also the monetization for us. [SEP] So, our team is working on creating more mobile-friendly ad formats and optimizing our mobile ad placement to ensure that we can drive maximum revenue while still providing a seamless experience for our users.","714":"We have developed a new feature that allows users to easily create and share their own content. This feature will increase engagement with our platform and attract new users. [SEP] You can share it on the platform. [SEP] Users can now share their content with their friends and followers within our platform, as well as on other social media channels. This is just one of the many exciting updates we have planned for the near future.","715":"Our strategy for growth is to expand our operations in new markets. [SEP] We see adding five more this year. [SEP] This will bring our total number of locations to 25 by the end of the year.","716":"During the fourth quarter of 2020, our company witnessed a significant increase in revenue compared to the same period last year. [SEP] Since -- in 2016, I think it's very fair to say that we were behind where we needed to be as with a lot of -- the rest of the industry and governments as well and expecting the kind of information operations that we now have seen. [SEP] However, our team worked tirelessly to address these challenges and invested heavily in our technology and security measures to ensure that our platform remains a safe and trustworthy space for our users.","717":"During Q3, we saw strong growth across all of our platforms. [SEP] And we\u2019re very pleased with the strong performance that we had with Facebook itself in the quarter. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are excited about the continued potential for revenue growth and user engagement on Facebook.","718":"We've been working hard to streamline and optimize our operations over the past year, from introducing new technology and automation tools to implementing process improvements across our facilities. [SEP] We have some really, really impressive gains and efficiencies in both the warehouses and also the data centers. [SEP] As a result, we've seen improvements across the board in terms of productivity, cost savings, and overall performance. Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing these efforts and finding new ways to drive even greater gains and efficiencies in the future.","719":"We've had a lot of questions lately about our investment in Quantum computing. [SEP] So that's how we look at it, but you got to remember that before Quantum, there are many byproducts of a quantum effort that have significant implications on how we get more competitive, efficient in terms of providing computing to the world. [SEP] And we feel that our development in this area puts us in a strong position for growth in the future.","720":"We have been making some changes to our business model to ensure that we are able to drive more predictable revenue streams. [SEP] And our focus will always be making sure we have a clear roadmap for customers to make long-term commitments through annuity and so we are really trying to get away from some of that launch impact that you may normally expect to see. [SEP] Our goal is to have a sustainable and scalable business that is built to last, and we believe that focusing on annuity-based revenue is the best way to achieve that.","721":"Now let's move on to a discussion of our business structure and performance. [SEP] We have a very large and diversified business. [SEP] In fact, we operate in multiple industries and have a strong presence both domestically and internationally.","722":"We've noticed a significant uptick in engagement and an increase in revenue from our online articles and written content. [SEP] So that's really what's driving it, not a shift to a different format like video. [SEP] This is why we plan on allocating more resources towards improving our written content and continuing to enhance our user experience on our website.","723":"Now I'd like to turn to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] Constant currency growth was 48%. [SEP] This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth, and we remain optimistic about our future growth prospects.","724":"Now let's turn to our iPhone sales performance over the past year. [SEP] iPhone was relatively flat year-on-year, similar as the market was. [SEP] However, we are pleased with our growth in our services and wearables categories, which more than offset the iPhone revenue decline.","725":"We've had a strong quarter with revenue growth across all regions and business segments. Our focus on cost optimization has also yielded positive results. [SEP] So I think that's what you're seeing. [SEP] Looking ahead, we see continued opportunities for growth in emerging markets. We also remain committed to investing in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the competition.","726":"Our focus this year has been on delivering more value to our customers. We're committed to reducing costs within our operations so that we can pass these savings onto our loyal customers. [SEP] We launched additional savings for Prime members at Whole Foods. [SEP] This move has resulted in a significant uptake in the number of Prime members shopping at Whole Foods. We continue to explore new ways to enhance the shopping experience for our customers, and we're excited about the potential for future collaborations between Amazon and Whole Foods.","727":"We're really excited about the latest Apple product release, the HomePod. This smart speaker is packed with features that we know our customers will love. [SEP] It also, obviously, you can also do things with HomePod like use it as a speaker phone. [SEP] We've also received great feedback on the sound quality of the HomePod. Customers have mentioned that it easily fills a room with rich, clear music. We're confident that the HomePod will continue to be a top product for us in the coming quarters.","728":"One of the reasons our customers are so loyal is because of our commitment to providing fast and reliable delivery. [SEP] So I think what that does is, again it strengthens your purchase decision, it strengthens the need to not have to go elsewhere to buy a product because you need it quickly. [SEP] And as we continue to expand our network of warehouses and distribution centers, we're confident we'll be able to offer even faster delivery times in the future.","729":"We are seeing more and more interest in virtual reality from our customers. [SEP] VR is still very early. [SEP] However, we remain committed to exploring the potential of VR and investing in its development for our business.","730":"We've heard a lot of feedback from our clients about how they want to see our advertising products evolve, and I'm really excited to share with you some of the progress we've made in that area. [SEP] And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brand marketers to direct response to SMBs to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurements get better. [SEP] The investments we've made in machine learning and AI have really paid off, and we're seeing some incredible results across all of our advertising formats. As a result, we're confident that we'll be able to continue to drive value for our partners and shareholders in the months and years ahead.","731":"We are very optimistic about the growth prospects in this region. [SEP] It's a huge market and it's clear that many people will be moving into the middle class over time, as we've seen in other countries. [SEP] Our company is well positioned to take advantage of this trend with our strong brand recognition and extensive distribution network.","732":"Now moving on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] Our reported results are on a normalized basis, removing the one-time item from last year, was 15%. [SEP] We continue to see strong growth in our core business and remain optimistic about the future.","733":"During the Q&A session of the conference call, a participant asked about the company's stance on government regulations. [SEP] So, we believe that there needs to be a regulatory framework in place for each of the major issues that I just talked about. [SEP] Our team has already reached out to policymakers and regulators to share our perspective and recommendations on these issues.","734":"We had projected a slight decrease in sales for this quarter, but to our delight, we actually saw a 3% increase. [SEP] That for us was a bit of a surprise, and a positive surprise, obviously. [SEP] We attribute this positive outcome to the new marketing strategy we implemented and the successful launch of our new product line. Our team is thrilled with these results and we plan to continue pushing for growth in the upcoming quarters.","735":"The Company's current video production capabilities are not as robust as their top competitors. [SEP] For production, I think that means that you need to get the camera experience, and the experience for capturing and uploading videos that you've captured to be much better in a more central part the of the experience. [SEP] By improving on these areas, we believe we can attract and retain a larger audience, especially amongst younger demographics who prioritize visual content.","736":"Now let's take a closer look at our revenue by customer segments. [SEP] In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. [SEP] We have been investing heavily in our sales and marketing efforts to continue driving growth across all segments.","737":"I'd now like to discuss our revenue recognition policy for our Prime subscription service. [SEP] This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method. [SEP] This change in accounting resulted in a decrease in our reported subscription revenue for the first quarter, but we believe it provides a more accurate representation of the timing of our revenue recognition.","738":"We are thrilled to report another strong quarter and want to thank our dedicated teams for their hard work and perseverance through a challenging year. [SEP] And maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year, during the March quarter. [SEP] Additionally, we are confident in our ability to continue expanding our services business and investing in new technologies to drive future growth.","739":"One thing to keep in mind is that while we provide many free services to our users, they still have value. [SEP] That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services. [SEP] This allows us to account for the cost of providing these services over time, rather than taking a large hit to our earnings in the quarter they are provided.","740":"And we're confident that this acquisition will help us expand our offerings in an area where we see a lot of growth potential. [SEP] So they will have that same profile, which is lower-margin services first, higher-margin services over time. [SEP] We believe that by offering this full range of services, we'll be able to better meet the needs of our clients and create long-term value for our shareholders.","741":"We're now going to open the floor for questions. [SEP] It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good support from our scale. [SEP] Our financial performance this quarter has been quite impressive, thanks in large part to strong demand for our products in key markets.","742":"Moving on to our financial results, I'd like to discuss our net income for the quarter. [SEP] It is actually impacted by the same thing that impacted free cash flow this quarter, which is about a $1.3 billion on settled cash settlement impact. [SEP] However, we expect this impact to be mitigated in the next quarter, as we continue to manage our cash settlement processes more efficiently.","743":"In terms of our photo sharing capabilities, we are constantly evaluating the market and our competitors. [SEP] Of course remember that both Apple and Google has built cameras and private photo sharing and photo management directly into their operating system. [SEP] However, we believe that our unique approach to photo sharing, which focuses on community and engagement, sets us apart from the competition.","744":"We have recently launched a new feature on our platform that allows vendors and sellers to easily connect with authors and vice versa. [SEP] There's a lot of - it's having a lot of pickup by both vendors, sellers and also authors.

[SEP] We are excited about expanding these features to other markets with similar needs and are constantly looking for ways to improve the overall user experience for our customers.","746":"Analyst: \"Can you give us an update on your thoughts regarding the impact of regulatory changes on the industry?\"\n\nCEO: \"Sure, I think it's important to note that the regulatory landscape is always in flux and that we have to be adaptable to changes as they occur. [SEP] And I just go back to the three factors that I cited in the past that the regulatory landscape is continuing to evolve. [SEP] CEO: \"The second factor is increased competition, particularly from new entrants and disruptive technologies. And the third factor is changing consumer preferences and behaviors, which are influencing how we approach our products and services.\" \n\nAnalyst: \"Thank you for that overview. Can you give us some specific examples of how you are adapting to these three factors?\" \n\nCEO: \"Certainly, we have recently implemented new compliance protocols to stay ahead of changing regulations, invested in AI technology to better compete with emerging fintech companies, and have launched several digital-first banking products to meet the changing needs of our customers.","747":"Our company has been closely watching global market trends and assessing potential growth opportunities.

We are committed to responsible spending and contributing to long-term sustainable growth.","749":"Our company remains committed to providing top-notch products and services to our customers.

[SEP] We learn from every Q4, this one was no exception. [SEP] We identified areas where we can improve and are already working on implementing changes for the next Q4.","751":"We are pleased to report a strong quarter with steady growth in our Services business. [SEP] And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in our Services division and remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers while driving profitability for our shareholders.","752":"Our research and development team has been working tirelessly to bring our new product line to market.

[SEP] We anticipate high demand for these devices and have ramped up our production to meet this demand.","753":"Our focus this quarter has been on customer satisfaction and improving our user experience. [SEP] We want to make it easier for our customers to actually use our services [SEP] Through extensive user testing and feedback, we have identified several areas of improvement and are already implementing changes to simplify our platform and streamline processes. We believe that by making it easier for our customers to use our services, we'll not only boost engagement and loyalty but also attract new users.","754":"Our expansion efforts are continuing to pay off, and we are seeing positive results in the markets we have entered. [SEP] We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter, or I should say some key gaming approvals. [SEP] With these key gaming approvals in hand, we can now move forward on our plans to open new gaming facilities and continue to grow our business. Our team is excited about the opportunities ahead, and we remain focused on delivering strong results for our shareholders.","755":"Can you walk us through the process of onboarding new sellers on your platform? [SEP] We let them do registration, imaging, catalog, uploads and basic seller training. [SEP] This has helped us to streamline the onboarding process and provide a smoother experience for new sellers.","756":"Our new marketing campaign has been quite successful in attracting a younger demographic to our platform. [SEP] So, I mean, that's what we're seeing in terms of driving engagement. [SEP] Additionally, we've noticed a significant increase in user-generated content and social sharing, which bodes well for the long-term growth of our platform.","757":"Can you provide some insights into your pricing strategy? [SEP] In terms of the way we price, we price to sort of the value that we're providing. [SEP] And how has that been working for the company in terms of profitability?\" \n\n\"In terms of the way we price, we price to sort of the value that we're providing. We believe that our product and service offerings provide significant value to our customers and we price accordingly. We've seen positive results from this strategy, with increased revenue and customer retention.","758":"We've had a challenging year with a lot of uncertainty around the industry and the pandemic's impact on our operations. [SEP] And so we turned the corner in Music. [SEP] We're optimistic about the upcoming quarter and expect to see even more growth in our Music division.","759":"Our research and development team has been working hard to improve our NAND manufacturing processes. [SEP] And also on the memory front, we feel that for NAND, we're going to be turning the corner very soon. [SEP] We expect this to result in higher yields and more efficient use of our production capacity.","760":"Our focus this quarter has been on meeting the changing needs of our customers. [SEP] And so, we're seeing consumers adopting that and we're building products for them. [SEP] As a result, we've seen strong growth in our sales numbers for the past few months.","761":"Can you talk a little bit more about your partnerships and how they fit into your overall business strategy? [SEP] We have transportation companies that we partnered with and other technology companies. [SEP] Our transportation partners help us with last-mile delivery and distribution, while our tech partners provide us with cutting-edge software and hardware solutions. By leveraging the expertise of these companies, we're able to provide a seamless end-to-end experience for our customers while also saving costs.","762":"Our company's revenue has been steadily increasing throughout the year. [SEP] And it continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. [SEP] As we look to next year, we anticipate further growth in our sales and profits.","763":"One analyst on the call asked about the company's performance in a particular quarter where supply seemed to be a major issue. [SEP] I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. [SEP] However, we are working diligently to address the supply constraint and expect to have a clearer picture of the demand in the next quarter.","764":"Our upgrade cycle has been slower than anticipated in the United States. [SEP] Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States, where we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? [SEP] However, we have seen strong demand for upgrades in international markets despite the higher prices.","765":"Now, moving onto our small and medium-sized business segment [SEP] There's still a small business at 100 people, but they are a growing business and showing the power of how our work with SMBs is growing jobs. [SEP] We're really proud of the positive impact we're having on local economies and job creation through our partnerships with SMBs.","766":"We've been discussing the idea of implementing more ads in our social media platforms. We understand the importance of generating revenue, but we also want to prioritize the user experience. [SEP] So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right [SEP] We're still exploring different possibilities and gathering feedback from our users and advertisers.

Ultimately, it's all about striking a balance between profitability and user satisfaction.","767":"Our technology infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations. [SEP] Then we've got data centers and data centers is a growing expenditure for us [SEP] However, despite the investment required, our data centers have enabled us to provide more reliable services to our clients and our employees.","768":"We've seen significant growth in our ad revenue from companies based in China over the past few quarters. [SEP] Because there are a lot of really big and important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools in a lot of cases to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer base. [SEP] Our efforts to further develop and improve our advertising tools to better serve these Chinese companies are ongoing, and we expect them to continue to be a valuable part of our business in the years to come.","769":"Our quarterly report shows that we have exceeded market expectations with a 15% increase in revenue. [SEP] While we saw improvement in the gross margin percentage in Office 365 and continue to make progress on that it is also the balance, right. [SEP] We remain confident that our strategic investments and focus on innovation will drive long-term growth and profitability.","770":"We have received inquiries from investors about expanding our operations overseas. [SEP] I wouldn't say yes at this point, but it's definitely something we are considering for the future. [SEP] Our team is conducting thorough market research to assess the feasibility of pursuing international expansion.","771":"So, looking at our Q3 results, it's important to keep in mind the seasonality of our business. [SEP] So \u2013 and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. [SEP] But despite these seasonal challenges, I'm pleased to report that we still exceeded our revenue targets for the quarter.","772":"We've been investing heavily in our content systems over the past year.

[SEP] But with each update, we're seeing improvements in engagement and revenue generation.","773":"As we move into the future of technology, I believe that there is a huge potential for augmented reality.

[SEP] By utilizing this technology, we can create a world where humans and machines work together in harmony, opening up endless possibilities for innovation and growth.","774":"Our advertising team has really been making strides lately, particularly in the area of targeted advertising. We've been seeing some great results from our campaigns, and we're excited to keep pushing forward with new initiatives.

[SEP] But that said, we see plenty of opportunity for total gross margin growth in terms of dollars just because of the number of markets that we participate, in which we by the way, never participated in the old server world. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to continue to increase gross margins as we expand into new markets and offer more advanced solutions.","779":"We understand that the market is constantly changing and evolving. [SEP] But so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that were beneficial to them. [SEP] That's why we're always looking for ways to innovate and improve our products and services.","780":"Now let's turn our attention to our workforce and staffing levels. [SEP] Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68% I believe. [SEP] Looking forward, we expect headcount growth to continue at a more moderate pace in line with our business operations.","781":"Thank you for joining us today on our earnings conference call. [SEP] We feel this really strong quarter. [SEP] This quarter's earnings exceeded our expectations and we are thrilled with the results.","782":"I think we're just continuing to see a secular trend of the technology industry really being the backbone of not only what businesses need to operate but how consumers live their lives. [SEP] And so therefore, from a secular perspective, we are all in on making sure that we invest in our commercial cloud as well as our investments in things like gaming and going after the opportunity that is there in front of us. [SEP] And so, it's a moment in time where you have this secular trend intersecting with an economic response to the pandemic, which has led to greater digital acceleration and investment. So, we feel pretty good about the opportunities that are in front of us and I think you see that reflected in the results that we had across the business this quarter.","783":"Thank you for your question. [SEP] And you're definitely right that a lot of the AI research that we do is applicable to multiple areas, but we still need to build those tools. [SEP] So, it's definitely a balancing act between investing in AI research and development while also ensuring we are delivering valuable solutions to our customers.","784":"Our investments in marketing and product development have really paid off. [SEP] So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that business as well. [SEP] We expect to continue this growth trajectory in the next quarter.","785":"Our revenue growth has been remarkable over the past few years as we expand our user base. We've witnessed tremendous adoption of our platform due to its superior user experience and innovative features. [SEP] I think we're in the early innings of it, not in the late innings, and I think the market rate of growth over the long haul will also be impressive. [SEP] Our strategy to diversify our revenue streams has also contributed to our growth, as we continue to explore new opportunities in emerging markets. Overall, we are confident in our ability to maintain our growth trajectory and capture more market share in the future.","786":"We are excited to share with you our plans for new product development.

[SEP] We have expanded into new markets and introduced new features to keep up with changing customer needs and preferences.","790":"We've had a lot of questions about how our new inventory management system works, so I want to take a moment to explain it a bit further. Essentially, we've invested in some new technology that allows us to track each individual item of clothing from the second it arrives in our warehouse to the moment it leaves in a customer's shopping bag. [SEP] And what they did in that test is tag each article of clothing. [SEP] This system has already proven invaluable in terms of minimizing errors and maximizing efficiency. Just last week, we ran a test to see how quickly and accurately we could locate a specific item in our warehouse using the new system. And what they did in that test is tag each article of clothing. The results were remarkable: we were able to locate the item in question in less than 30 seconds, whereas the old system would have taken over 10 minutes. We're excited to see how this technology continues to improve our operations going forward.","791":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our logistics operations and remain competitive in the market.

We have been closely monitoring the impact of currency movements on our business. [SEP] And the other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second and now we've gone through a couple of cycles where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. [SEP] We have implemented various strategies to mitigate the impact of currency movements on our revenue. Our focus has been on increasing our revenue from international markets and reducing our exposure to currency risk.","793":"We have received a lot of questions from investors about our plans for expenses in the upcoming year. Can you give us some insight into how you're thinking about this? [SEP] In terms of the expense guide in 2020, I would say that obviously we plan to -- a large factor of our expense growth is driven off of headcount. [SEP] Can you give us an idea of how much you plan to increase headcount, and in which departments or areas?\"\n\n\"So, our plan is to continue to invest heavily in our product development and customer support teams, which is where we're seeing the most growth and demand. We also plan to open up a new office in a strategic location, which will require hiring additional staff.\"\n\n\"Of course, we're also mindful of keeping our expenses under control, and we'll be closely monitoring our spending in non-essential areas. Overall, we're confident that these investments will pay off in the long run and position us for continued success.","794":"Our focus on improving the user experience and rolling out new features has clearly resonated with our customers.

We know we have to change our strategy and implement some changes. [SEP] So it's going to take time. [SEP] But we're committed to making those changes and we believe they will lead to long-term success. We appreciate our shareholders' patience and support as we work through this transition period.","797":"We have been working on this project for several months now and have made significant progress. [SEP] But I\u2019m really confident that this is something we really understand how to do and will do. [SEP] Our team is fully committed to delivering the best possible results for our shareholders and customers.","798":"We are pleased to announce another successful quarter for our company. Our revenue has increased by 15% year-over-year, reaching a total of $2.5 billion. [SEP] So again, we had margin expansion year-over-year that was quite significant, from 12.4% to 23.5%. [SEP] This margin expansion was a result of our efforts to reduce costs and increase operational efficiency. We anticipate this trend to continue in the upcoming quarters as we streamline our processes and implement new technologies. Overall, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders.","799":"We've seen encouraging growth in this particular geographic region and we believe there is still untapped potential. [SEP] And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. [SEP] We're confident that the investments we're making now will pay off in the future and we're excited to see how this market evolves.","800":"We've been working hard to enhance our platform and create more value for our users. Part of that effort has been focused on improving the way people buy and sell products on Facebook. [SEP] You are seeing us take other steps like a buy button, like the Marketplace launch, which are really aimed at improving some of the experiences we think people are trying to have and already having in organic ways on Facebook. [SEP] Our buy button allows users to make transactions directly within Facebook, making it more convenient and seamless than ever before. And with the launch of our Marketplace, we're creating a dedicated space where people can discover, buy, and sell items with ease. These initiatives are just the beginning of our efforts to create a more robust and user-friendly platform for our community.","801":"We have noticed a decline in our stock price over the past few weeks. [SEP] And so it's not a revenue-related issue. [SEP] However, we are closely monitoring our expenses to ensure profitability in the coming months.","802":"Our company has had a successful quarter, with revenue up by 12% from last year. [SEP] And it's number one in China, which is another powerful point. [SEP] We are excited to see continued growth in our international markets, particularly in Asia where we have seen a 25% increase in sales over the past year.","803":"We've seen significant growth in our Prime memberships over the past year. [SEP] So, yeah, we think this is an important part of our Prime offering. [SEP] And based on the positive feedback we've received from our Prime members, we're confident that this addition will continue to drive that growth.","804":"Let's move on to our product categories and take a closer look at our performance over the past quarter. [SEP] So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our launch timing is different on a year-over-year basis. [SEP] In terms of overall sales, both categories saw an increase compared to the same quarter last year, despite the launch timing differences.","805":"Now turning to our services segment. We are pleased to report strong growth in this area. [SEP] The services grew 31%. [SEP] This growth was largely driven by increased demand for our cloud-based offerings, as well as new partnerships and acquisitions. We anticipate continued growth in this segment in the coming quarters.","806":"We have seen strong growth in our existing businesses and are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. Our strategic focus remains on expanding our portfolio of businesses that have significant growth potential and align with our long-term vision. [SEP] So we will continue to invest in the businesses we think fit that profile and we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile. [SEP] At the same time, we are mindful of maintaining a disciplined approach to investing and ensuring that each new business we add can contribute to our overall success. Our goal is to create sustainable value for our shareholders and stakeholders over the long term, and we are committed to achieving this through strategic investments in high-potential businesses.","807":"Our recent efforts in expanding our product line have proven to be successful. We've been able to reach new markets and generate higher revenues than expected. [SEP] We think there's more of these that we can do. [SEP] Our team is constantly looking for new opportunities for growth and innovation. We're confident that our continued efforts will lead to even greater success in the future.","808":"Can you give us some color on how the current market conditions are impacting your business? [SEP] So there's many puts and takes. [SEP] Overall, we're cautiously optimistic about our ability to navigate these challenges and remain profitable in the long-term.","809":"One of the key drivers of our growth this quarter was the strong adoption of Microsoft Office 365. [SEP] So customization, customization and composition, especially with Office 365, is very important, and this is where we have some very differentiated offer with Power BI, PowerApps and Flow. [SEP] We continue to see great potential in these offerings and are committed to investing in further enhancements to bring even greater value to our customers.","810":"We have seen strong growth in our revenue from mobile devices in the past quarter. [SEP] And so iPhone X has done well there. [SEP] Our strategy to focus on premium devices is continuing to pay off, with strong demand for our latest models across all markets.","811":"We did see a slight dip in sales compared to last quarter, but overall the numbers are still very strong. [SEP] So I don't think of it as reflecting a bigger shift than we've seen in particular this quarter. [SEP] However, we do anticipate some challenges ahead as the industry continues to navigate the ongoing pandemic and economic uncertainty.","812":"Our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction has helped us maintain steady growth in the past years. [SEP] We've seen lots of consecutive quarters of growth in our higher-level services but we're now seeing some good scale. [SEP] As we continue to expand our offerings and improve our efficiencies, we are confident in our ability to sustain this momentum and drive sustainable, long-term growth.","813":"We have seen significant growth in our fulfillment centers over the last quarter. [SEP] So it's not all FC capacity, that's square footage. [SEP] This has helped us to expand our product offerings and increase our speed and efficiency in order fulfillment.","814":"We're often asked how we consistently grow our portfolio of successful companies. \n- Our success is not by accident, but rather by design. [SEP] And we have a formula for how we build these businesses. [SEP] It starts with identifying markets that are ripe for disruption. \n- From there, we assemble a team of experts in those markets and give them the resources they need to innovate and create disruptive solutions. \n- Finally, we provide ongoing support to help those companies scale and achieve their full potential. \n- This formula has proved successful time and time again, and we're confident it will continue to drive growth in the future.","815":"Our company has achieved outstanding results this quarter. [SEP] And sales by sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined in Q4. [SEP] This is a testament to the hard work of our sales team and the loyalty of our customers. We are confident that this momentum will continue into the new year.","816":"So, moving on to our Q2 results, I am pleased to report that we exceeded our revenue target by 10%. [SEP] The primary benefit was the two things I just talked about. [SEP] Additionally, we were able to reduce our operating expenses by 5% through cost-cutting measures implemented earlier this year.","817":"Our revenue for the quarter has exceeded our expectations. [SEP] And we're really proud of the growth of the business. [SEP] As we look ahead to the next quarter, we are optimistic about further growth opportunities.","818":"Our team has been working tirelessly over the last few months to perfect this product. [SEP] I could not be prouder of the product. [SEP] The positive feedback we have already received from our customers has been overwhelming and we are excited to see where this product takes us in the future.","819":"As we continue to adapt to changing consumer behavior and market dynamics [SEP] So our goal is to have lots of different things we can do for our marketers and measure them really deeply all the way through to business results. [SEP] We believe this approach will give us a competitive edge in the industry and help our clients achieve their desired outcomes.","820":"Thank you for joining our earnings conference call today. I'm pleased to report that we have had a strong quarter, with revenue growth of 15% year over year, driven by our diversified product portfolio and geographic expansion. [SEP] One part of the business that I think has been really strong and is worth noting is we're working with marketers in China to help with their export business. [SEP] Our team has been working closely with local Chinese companies to understand their needs and provide them with tailored solutions to expand their customer base abroad. This has resulted in significant revenue growth for both our partners and our company. We are committed to continuing this partnership and expanding our reach in the Chinese market. Thank you.","821":"Our marketing team worked hard this quarter to optimize our ad campaigns on various social media platforms. [SEP] That ad was so successful on Facebook and Instagram that they then ran the 60-second ad on TV instead of their 30-second ad. [SEP] This switch led to a significant increase in brand recognition and sales, which exceeded our projections for the quarter.","822":"Now turning to our financial position...\"\n2. \"As we look at our current assets and liabilities...\"\n3. \"Moving on to our cash reserves...\"\n4. \"Regarding our liquidity... [SEP] We do have some cash in the U.S. [SEP] And we are actively exploring opportunities to deploy this cash in ways that will generate long-term value for our shareholders.\"\n2. \"However, we remain cautious in our approach given the ongoing uncertainty in the market.\"\n3. \"Our cash position is one of our strengths, and we will continue to manage it prudently.\"\n4. \"We anticipate that our cash position will remain stable over the next quarter, barring any unforeseen circumstances.","823":"One of the things we've seen in the market is a trend towards hybrid environments where customers are deploying workloads both on-premise and in the cloud. This is particularly important for certain industries like healthcare and financial services where data sovereignty and regulatory compliance requirements are critical. [SEP] In general today Mark almost all of that benefit shows up in what I would say as the on-premise KPI, and so over time though how you should think about that it will eventually show up in Azure consumed revenue growth, this is a benefit that\u2019s fundamentally about high value and flexibility and meeting customers where they are so that they can make a determination of when to make that choice. [SEP] We believe this hybrid approach is the future of computing and will continue to invest heavily in tools and technologies that enable seamless integration between on-premise and cloud environments. We're already seeing strong demand for our hybrid solutions and expect this trend to accelerate in the coming quarters. Overall, we're extremely pleased with the progress we're making in this area and believe it will be a key driver of growth for us going forward.","824":"We have always been committed to delivering high-quality products to our customers. [SEP] And we've continued to do that this quarter as well. [SEP] Our sales numbers reflect the success of this approach and we are optimistic about our future growth.","825":"Moving on to our user metrics, let's take a closer look at our Groups feature. [SEP] We look at \u2013 there are more than 1 billion people every month who use our Groups product. [SEP] We believe that this impressive user engagement is a testament to the value and utility that our Groups product provides to our community.","826":"Now turning to our growth strategy for the quarter. [SEP] Keep in mind; we started in acquisition where we were below our targeted range. [SEP] However, with recent successful acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we are confident in our ability to reach our targeted range in the coming quarters.","827":"Now, let's talk about our revenue breakdown for the quarter. [SEP] If you want to get to total bookings, you just add back in all the consumer revenue, is technically is how you would do it [SEP] But for the purpose of today's discussion, we will only focus on our net bookings.","828":"Our cloud services segment continues to be a strong driver of growth for our overall business. Let's take a closer look at our Amazon Web Services (AWS) division. [SEP] In terms of AWS, we've had 48 price decreases since inception. [SEP] While some may view these price decreases as a negative impact on our profitability, we strongly believe that maintaining a competitive pricing structure is key to retaining our market share and creating long-term customer loyalty. Additionally, as our technology continues to advance and become more efficient, we are able to pass these cost savings onto our customers in the form of lower prices.","829":"Our overall revenue in the last quarter has increased significantly, largely due to the growth of our cloud services. [SEP] But at this point I would say, we have emerging ISVs, some of the global ISVs building SaaS applications on top of Azure driving a significant amount of growth of new businesses, the new business models emerging on Azure, as well as hybrid, which I would say are driving. [SEP] We are continuing to invest in both the development and marketing of our Azure platform, as we believe it is crucial to the future success of our company.","830":"We are extremely pleased with the progress we have made in the last quarter and would like to share with you our updated guidance. Our team has been working hard to drive operational efficiencies and we are seeing positive results. [SEP] So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. [SEP] Additionally, we have updated our revenue guidance to reflect stronger than expected demand for our products. Our sales team has been successful in expanding our customer base and increasing our market share. Overall, we feel confident in our ability to exceed expectations for the remainder of the year.","831":"We have received many questions regarding the timeframe for the release of our new product line. [SEP] And just to clarify, what we had been saying was early 2015, and we sort of look at the year and think of early as the first four months, mid is the next four months and late is the final four months. [SEP] We want to make sure our customers have a clear understanding of when they can expect these new products to hit the market. We will continue to keep investors and stakeholders informed on any updates regarding the product launch.","832":"Let's take a few more questions. [SEP] Justin on time spent, there is no question that video is helping us on time spent and engagement. [SEP] We're also seeing great results from our new social media campaigns.","833":"We have seen impressive growth across our product lines this quarter, especially in our cloud services offering. Our focus on digital transformation and modern workplaces has allowed us to capture new market opportunities and deliver more value to our customers. [SEP] Overall I would say there\u2019s a secular movement that\u2019s happening in particular with Office 365, quite frankly, it\u2019s happening across the entire product portfolio of Microsoft which is more to what I would described as annuity relationship as well as subscription relationships. [SEP] As a result, we are experiencing a shift towards a more predictable revenue stream that aligns with our long-term strategy. This is particularly evident with Office 365, which has become the cornerstone of our productivity and collaboration solutions. We remain committed to investing in our product portfolio and delivering the best possible experience to our customers, while continuing to drive sustained growth for our business.","834":"Our mobile app platform has seen tremendous growth over the past quarter. We're excited to share some of the latest developments with you today. [SEP] The number of developers that are writing apps more for it are impressive and we\u2019re seeing some incredible innovation coming out there. [SEP] This growth is driving increased revenue for our company, and we're confident it will continue to do so in the future. We're committed to supporting our developers and providing them with the tools and resources they need to create amazing apps on our platform.","835":"We are pleased to announce that our company has achieved record-breaking revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020. [SEP] It was the highest ever by far. [SEP] This demonstrates the strength of our business model and our ability to continue providing value to our customers.","836":"In terms of our financial performance, we have seen some challenges this quarter. [SEP] We\u2019re looking of course at our cost structure, and we try to remain as competitive as possible. [SEP] However, despite the difficulties, we are confident in our ability to continue to grow.","837":"Our revenue forecasts for the next quarter are based on various factors including market trends, sales pipeline, and customer feedback. However, there are certain uncertainties that make it challenging for us to accurately predict our financial performance. [SEP] So it's always a very difficult period for us to estimate. [SEP] We are constantly monitoring the market and adapting our strategies to ensure we are able to navigate any unexpected challenges. Our teams are working diligently to minimize any negative impacts on our business and continue delivering value to our customers. We remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects despite the current economic climate.","838":"Our digital advertising platform has been performing exceptionally well. We're thrilled to report another quarter of success, where we've seen growth across all our key metrics. [SEP] We're growing the number of advertisers and publishers, and we're continuing to see growth and we'll continue to invest. [SEP] Our team is focusing on developing new features and improving our offerings to ensure that we remain at the forefront of the digital advertising industry. We anticipate that this investment will support our continued growth and drive long-term value for all our stakeholders.","839":"We've seen our mobile DAUs continue to grow over the past quarter, which has resulted in a shift in the overall impression mix between desktop and mobile. As we continue to invest in our mobile product offerings, we expect this trend to continue. [SEP] So as it gets smaller, it has less of a depressive effect on the overall impression growth number, because if you recall, desktop has quite a number of impressions per DAU, just given it's the right-hand column that has multiple impressions on each screen. [SEP] This shift in impression mix has impacted our overall impression growth rate, but we remain confident in the strength of our mobile offerings and the long-term growth potential they provide. Over time, we expect mobile to become an even larger portion of our overall business, and we remain committed to investing in its continued success.","840":"Can you comment on the company's growth outlook for the next quarter? [SEP] Even at decreasing growth rates, we are still growing and predicting growth at very healthy rates, and that's based on returning for advertisers. [SEP] We've seen great success with our recent marketing campaigns and we expect to expand our customer base even further in the coming months.","841":"Our goal is to improve our margins and drive profitability for our shareholders. [SEP] We have been working and continuing to reinvest and save through the year as we look to get everything here more efficient. [SEP] We believe this investment in efficiency will enable us to better serve our customers and increase our overall revenue.","842":"Our overall revenue for Q3 was strong, with a year-over-year increase of 10%. [SEP] And so I do think we saw some impact, particularly in SQL and I do expect to see some of that in Q4. [SEP] However, we are confident that our strong product portfolio and customer relationships will continue to drive growth, and we are forecasting a strong finish to the year.","843":"We've seen a decrease in overall sales numbers, particularly in our western region. [SEP] So there are a couple factors there. [SEP] The rising cost of raw materials is also putting pressure on our profit margins.","844":"When we look at our user engagement numbers over the last quarter, we're definitely seeing some interesting trends. [SEP] I think that's pretty similar to the trends that we've seen in that metric. [SEP] Of course, there are always fluctuations and variables at play, but overall I'm feeling optimistic about our user engagement efforts.","845":"We recognize that these are unprecedented times and our customers are facing economic challenges. [SEP] But for the near-term, the way that we\u2019re thinking about it is offering as many of these things at cost and for free as possible to deliver as much value to small businesses and businesses around the world. [SEP] In the long-term, we are focusing on innovating and expanding our product offerings to meet the evolving needs of the market.","846":"One of our key priorities for the year has been to invest heavily in research and development. [SEP] For example, the work that we're doing on full end-to-end encryption, that's just -- that's a long-term project. [SEP] However, we believe that the benefits of implementing this technology will be immense, and we are committed to seeing it through to completion.","847":"We've been closely monitoring the progress of our various projects and initiatives. [SEP] Some are much further along than others, but overall we're very happy. [SEP] We believe that, with continued effort, we can succeed in all of our endeavors.","848":"In addition to our efforts with Instagram, we are continuing to invest in our messaging platforms. We see these platforms as a key growth opportunity for the company. [SEP] We have a number of other things that we're working on across Messenger and WhatsApp. [SEP] We believe that incorporating more features such as payment options and e-commerce capabilities will enhance the user experience and provide new revenue streams. We are excited about the potential of these platforms and will continue to prioritize their development.","849":"We are seeing tremendous growth in our cloud services as more and more companies are looking to modernize their IT systems. Our focus on innovation and customer service has enabled us to become a leader in this space. [SEP] Interesting enough, we have a lot of requirements around edge devices even, so that you can have databases with compute so that you can really have what is needed at the edge, that\u2019s sort of one conversation. [SEP] Another important discussion we're having with customers is around cybersecurity. As the amount of data being generated and stored continues to increase, protecting that data from cyber threats is becoming increasingly crucial. We are investing heavily in this area to ensure that our customers have the best possible protection.","850":"We have implemented cost-cutting measures across the board in response to the current economic climate. [SEP] So that will also minimize the impact that will have on the top line. [SEP] However, we remain cautiously optimistic about our ability to generate strong earnings in the coming quarters.","851":"I'd like to focus now on our performance in emerging markets. [SEP] And in fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. [SEP] This is a testament to the resilience of our business model and the strength of our relationships with customers in these regions.","852":"We have been working hard to increase customer retention and loyalty. [SEP] That's to us to the best way for us to keep having that recurring value. [SEP] We will continue to focus on providing exceptional service and innovation to maintain our customer satisfaction and retention rates.","853":"We have seen some fluctuations in our bookings and expiry rates in the past quarter. We have been closely analyzing the data to understand the underlying trends. [SEP] I think there is and you'll see that dynamic, so if the expiry base is a little bigger, you'd expect obviously a number bigger than that on the booking side and when the expiry rates' growth - it's really about the delta between the two as you know. [SEP] We are confident that our strategy to drive increased bookings will continue to yield positive results. Our team is focused on building stronger relationships with our customers and enhancing our product offerings to better meet their needs. We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and achieving our long-term growth objectives.","854":"When asked about the perceived competition between our company and social media platforms, our CEO had this to say:\n\nStatement: \"It\u2019s not always the choice of TV or Facebook, but often we can be a complement. [SEP] It\u2019s not always the choice of TV or Facebook, but often we can be a complement. [SEP] As more and more viewers multitask while watching TV, we see ourselves as a valuable second-screen option for engaging with audiences and creating a truly immersive viewing experience. By partnering with social media companies and investing in our own digital capabilities, we can continue to be a powerful force in the media landscape.","855":"During the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our Teams platform, driven by increased demand for remote collaboration and digital communication tools. [SEP] The other point about Teams is just not limited to knowledge workers, which has been really the only place traditionally we play. [SEP] We've been excited to see the adoption of Teams in other types of industries as well, such as healthcare and education. This opens up new opportunities for us to expand our offerings and reach new markets.","856":"Our app review team has made significant progress in ensuring that only high-quality apps are available on our platform. [SEP] And where it is not perfect, we wind up reviewing over 100,000 apps per week between new apps and updates for existing apps, and then work with developers quickly to fix the issues. [SEP] This rigorous process has led to a reduction in the number of low-quality, fraudulent, and non-compliant apps on our platform, and has helped us maintain the trust and satisfaction of our users.","857":"During our first quarter, we faced some significant headwinds that impacted our financial performance. [SEP] Of course, as you look further out, you know we do not provide guidance past the March quarter, but it goes without saying that at current levels, again those headwinds will continue to become stronger for the reason I explained earlier, that our hedges continue to expire, they get replaced by new hedging contracts at current levels and we don't have the same level of protection that we had in the past. [SEP] This means that we need to remain vigilant in managing our costs and continuing to explore new revenue streams. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term.","858":"Our research shows that a significant portion of our customer base is still using 3G devices. [SEP] And so there's an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 3G handsets. [SEP] We are actively promoting our newer devices and services to these customers and expect to see a significant boost in revenue from this upgrade cycle in the coming quarters.","859":"Our company is continuously innovating to stay ahead of the competition. [SEP] And that means there's, in many ways, almost limitless opportunity for consumers to do more. [SEP] As a result, we expect to see strong growth in sales and revenue in the coming quarters.","860":"We are excited to announce our updated strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to ensure that we are able to seamlessly integrate these two areas moving forward.","861":"I would like to address our company's current approach to digital payments. As you know, we have been exploring various avenues to make online transactions more seamless and secure... [SEP] And we also differentiate between payment systems that are built on top of the existing financial infrastructure like what we're trying to do with WhatsApp payments or when we make payments in Instagram Shopping, and our work with something like Libra that is trying to build some new technological infrastructure for financial services. [SEP] Overall, we're excited to continue innovating in the field of digital payments, and we believe that by offering options that build on existing infrastructure as well as new technologies, we can create a more inclusive financial system for everyone.","862":"We've seen fantastic growth in our Stories feature over the past year... [SEP] I would say Stories is today from an impression growth perspective really about Instagram Stories. [SEP] We've been able to innovate and add new features to keep users engaged and coming back daily, which has helped drive advertising revenue.","863":"We've seen a shift in consumer behavior over the last year. More and more people are relying on their smartphones for everyday activities. [SEP] And that really means mobile. [SEP] Our team is working on improving the user experience on our mobile app and optimizing our mobile advertising strategy. We see tremendous growth potential in this area.","864":"We faced some challenges in the early stages, but I think we have made good progress overall. \"\n- \"We had to make some adjustments to our strategy and operations, but we are now seeing positive signs. [SEP] So I\u2019m generally happy that we\u2019re moving on with the ramp. [SEP] Of course, there is still much work to be done, and we need to keep the momentum going.\"\n- \"We have some ambitious targets, and we will need to stay focused and agile to achieve them.\"\n- \"I want to thank our team for their hard work and dedication, and our customers for their continued support.","865":"Moving on to our cloud computing segment, I am pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter. [SEP] I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. [SEP] We are continuing to invest in the growth of our AWS business, and we anticipate even stronger results in the coming quarters.","866":"Can you provide some context around the customer retention rate for the third quarter? [SEP] The 86% also seems low to me but I was quoting a third-party source and not our own data. [SEP] We will do a deep dive into our own data to get a better understanding of our current customer retention rate and see if there are any areas we can improve upon.","867":"I'm pleased to report that our earnings for the quarter have exceeded expectations. [SEP] Our other segments are growing as well. [SEP] We anticipate continued growth in these areas in the coming quarters as we invest in new technology and expand our customer base.","868":"We continue to see growth in the cloud computing market and are focused on expanding our offerings to meet the needs of our customers. [SEP] So one of the things that we are in fact very focused on is enabling others to build their own clouds. [SEP] Through our cloud platform, we have seen businesses of all sizes successfully build and scale their own cloud infrastructure, and we believe this trend will continue to grow in the coming years.","869":"Our earnings report shows an increase in revenue from Office Consumer products, mainly due to strong sales in developed markets. [SEP] So the strength from that outperformance or better market in consumer PCs in developed markets is a direct correlation to our performance in Office Consumer. [SEP] Additionally, our Office Consumer segment has seen a rise in demand for remote work tools as more people continue to work from home.","870":"When asked about the impact of the recent decline in the value of the US dollar on the company's financial performance, the CEO responded... [SEP] Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, if it holds, will be a positive but it's not something that you're going to be seeing translating to gross margin tailwind quickly. [SEP] However, we do anticipate some benefits in terms of increased demand for our products in markets outside of the US.","871":"Our earnings this quarter have exceeded our expectations and we're excited to share some updates with you all. [SEP] So very, very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year.

Users are spending more time watching videos on our platform than ever before. [SEP] That means more time in video, and that does come at the expense of some impression growth in News Feed. [SEP] However, we believe that this shift towards video will ultimately result in a more engaged user base, as videos tend to generate higher levels of emotional response and social interaction. Additionally, we are exploring new ways to monetize video content, which could result in significant revenue growth for the company in the future.","874":"Now I would like to focus on some of the key areas of growth that we've experienced over the past few quarters.

[SEP] Our team has worked hard to create a modular system that allows for greater customization and flexibility. With Dynamics 365, customers can choose the features they need and leave behind those they don't. We believe this approach is more in line with the needs of modern businesses and will help us stay ahead of the curve.","878":"We have been working on our customer migration strategy for the past quarter.

[SEP] On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that this quarter we had 18% year-over-year desktop revenue growth. [SEP] We did see some impact from ad blocking during the quarter, but it was minimal. Our desktop revenue growth of 18% year-over-year is a testament to the strength of our business model and the resilience of our advertising strategy.

[SEP] But overall, I do feel confident about where we are. [SEP] Our team has been working diligently to develop new strategies for growth and we are optimistic about our future prospects.","952":"Thank you for joining us for our Q3 earnings call. Our company had a strong performance this quarter, driven primarily by our sales in the tech sector. [SEP] We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive, we're going to have of course better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. [SEP] However, we do anticipate some challenges in the December quarter due to a slowdown in consumer spending during the holiday season. We will continue to focus on optimizing our operational efficiency and building strategic partnerships to navigate this situation. Overall, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects and look forward to providing updates in our next earnings call.","953":"When asked about the company's streaming content strategy, the CEO responded that they are pleased with the results they are seeing. [SEP] So beyond the awards that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon, particularly our Amazon Originals, we feel that program is working. [SEP] Additionally, we have recently secured partnerships with several major networks to distribute their shows on our platform, further expanding our offerings to our subscribers.","954":"We'll now take our first question from Ross. [SEP] I mean, on the first question Ross as far as our premium services, just even on the application infrastructure side, for example, in compute, there is increasing need for things like IoT services. [SEP] And so we're continuing to invest in those areas to provide more and more options, not just for our existing clients, but for new clients that are coming in the door.","955":"Looking at our revenue growth over the past quarter, we are extremely pleased with the results.

[SEP] We think it's a great opportunity to reach customers who are already in a discovery mindset. [SEP] We'll be launching targeted ad campaigns on social media platforms to reach this audience.","957":"Moving on to questions from the analysts on the call. [SEP] On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business and you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. [SEP] However, we are always looking for ways to become more efficient and competitive, so we will continue to evaluate pricing strategies.","958":"We recognize that there are some challenges ahead, but we're confident that with the right strategies in place, we can continue to grow and succeed in the market. Now, I'd like to discuss some of the steps we're taking to achieve our goals.

[SEP] This year, we have decided to include more detailed data on customer demographics and purchasing behaviors to help inform our marketing strategy.","962":"Our revenue for the second quarter came in at $500 million, which was a slight increase from the first quarter. [SEP] So we are starting to see as I mentioned in earlier calls that the investment will be stepping up in 2019, so started to see that in Q2.

As we move forward into the second half of the year, we will be closely monitoring our progress and making any necessary adjustments to our strategy.","963":"Our company has been profitable this quarter, with increased revenue and reduced expenses.

[SEP] We are confident that our investment in these new tools and experiences will pay off in increased revenue and customer satisfaction.","968":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our technology and stay ahead of the curve in our industry. [SEP] And in that modernizing phase, it's not just being modernized to live only in what is called a cloud, but it will also be modernized to live in the edge of the cloud. [SEP] This expansion to the edge of the cloud will allow for even greater flexibility and accessibility for our customers.","969":"We have been working diligently to improve the shipping times of our products globally. Our customers have been asking for faster delivery options and we want to meet their expectations. [SEP] But this is intended to be a global improvement in speed tied to our Prime program. [SEP] Through the Prime program, we have been able to offer significant benefits to our members, including free and fast shipping. We are confident that these improvements will enhance the overall customer experience and drive growth for our business.","970":"We have seen strong growth in our sales figures over the past year, and we are confident that this trend will continue.

However, I believe that our focus on providing exceptional value to our customers is our core strength, and it will be a key driver of our success going forward. Thank you for your time today, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.","971":"We made a significant investment in a new product line last year, and I'm pleased to report that it's paying off. Our team has worked tirelessly to bring this new line to market, and I couldn't be prouder of their efforts. [SEP] And the results have actually been better than we anticipated when we first made the investment.

We believe that our innovative approach and dedication to quality will set us apart from the competition, and we're excited to see what the future holds. Thank you all for your continued support and investment in our company.","972":"We've been closely monitoring user activity on our platform. [SEP] But certainly there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there which is looking for things that, over time, could be monetizable or commercial intent. [SEP] We'll continue to analyze this behavior and explore opportunities to generate revenue in a way that enhances user experience.","973":"Can you expand on your target market for this new product? [SEP] The initial market that we look at are all the people who have Xboxes, PlayStations, and Wiis, the people who are excited to have an immersive media experience sitting in their living room for a long period of time, and that's a pretty big market. [SEP] But beyond that, we see potential for our immersive media experience to reach a broader audience through partnerships with streaming services and smart TV manufacturers.","974":"We\u2019ve been closely monitoring our customer satisfaction rates over the past quarter. [SEP] And that number is in the low 30 percentages. [SEP] We're committed to improving this figure and have implemented several initiatives to address customer concerns.","975":"Now, turning to our strategy for the next fiscal year.

Our team has been working hard to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for our users. [SEP] In some of the products, I would urge people to look at the Outlook Mobile experience and how really meaningful the experience is for the user and the member. [SEP] We believe that our mobile products will continue to be a major driver of growth for our company. With the increased focus on mobile usage, we're confident that our products will continue to exceed user expectations.","978":"Moving on to our Prime membership... [SEP] So we're really excited about the creative team we've assembled and the products that they've been able to bring to Prime customers. [SEP] We have seen significant growth in both user engagement and revenue in the past quarter as a result.","979":"Can you give us some insight into how you're allocating your AWS resources and capital expenditures? [SEP] Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth. [SEP] However, we also continue to invest in expanding our infrastructure to meet the needs of new customers that are coming on board, particularly in emerging markets where we see a lot of potential for growth.","980":"We've seen great success with our current marketing campaigns. [SEP] So we want to continue to do that. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new partnerships to expand our customer base even further.","981":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our Stories ads feature from our customers in the last quarter.

We have streamlined our operations, restructured our teams, and shifted our focus towards digital innovation. [SEP] We've tried to run the company in a way where we have -- we set up the infrastructure, and we set up the business models. [SEP] As a result of these efforts, we have seen strong revenue growth and improved profitability. However, we recognize that there is still work to be done, particularly in terms of optimizing our supply chain and expanding our customer base.","984":"We've had a great year of financial success, with record-breaking revenue and profitability. [SEP] And so that's what we're doing from a job growth point of view, and we're very, very proud of that. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are committed to continuing this positive trend and investing in our employees to drive even more job growth for years to come.","985":"Now, turning to our growth strategy for the year ahead. [SEP] The first is regulatory as you think about things like GDPR and other impacts and how those will be rolling out globally. [SEP] The second area we are closely monitoring is macroeconomic conditions and their potential implications for our business.","986":"Can you discuss your company's approach to software development frameworks? [SEP] We have real openness to all of the frameworks that you can call out to, and that something that we stay very attuned to come out which is we are not trying to fight some old battles. [SEP] Instead, we're focused on finding the most efficient and effective solutions for our customers' needs.","987":"We are excited to share our growth strategy for the upcoming year. [SEP] Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%. [SEP] This expansion allowed us to reach new markets and increase our customer base.","988":"I'd like to give an update on our digital product offerings. [SEP] This was actually a database we just launched last year. [SEP] Since its launch, the database has exceeded our expectations and has become a valuable tool for our clients.","989":"I'd like to turn to our cloud infrastructure now. [SEP] Again, Keith, when we look at either the capital expense or the technical architecture, and the general approach we take is about all of our cloud. [SEP] We believe that this strategy will position us for long-term success in the increasingly competitive cloud market.","990":"We've seen tremendous growth in the video consumption on our platform. \n- Videos are now the most shared and engaged content on our platform. [SEP] And that's what we're trying to do with the video tab, to make it so that all the different folks, whether they're pages that you follow or creators that you like, who you want to subscribe to and get the updates to what they're doing, that you have a place that you can go to with more intent to consume that content. [SEP] We're also investing in video ad formats to make sure that we're delivering value to our advertisers and generating revenue for the company.\n- The feedback we've received so far from our users has been very positive about the video tab and we're excited about the new features we're adding in the coming months.","991":"Now turning to our mobile phone sales, I'd like to provide some insight into the performance of our latest flagship device. As you all know, we launched the new model in the second quarter of this year. [SEP] The phone itself followed what I would call a normal seasonal kind of pattern. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with the sales figures for the smartphone and we believe it has been well received by consumers. Looking ahead, we anticipate a boost in sales during the holiday season, particularly with our marketing push for the phone's unique features and capabilities.","992":"We've seen a significant increase in sales this quarter. [SEP] And so there's lots of pluses and minuses on this. [SEP] However, the cost of production has also gone up due to supply chain disruptions.","993":"Our user growth has been strong and steady over the past year, and we anticipate continued growth in the coming quarters. [SEP] So, yeah, we are investing ahead of user growth, given the long lead time in deploying data centers and network capacity. [SEP] However, we believe that these investments will position us well for long-term success and allow us to better serve our users and customers.","994":"We've had some challenges this quarter, but I'm proud of our team's hard work and dedication. We've been focused on delivering value to our customers and investing in our technology. [SEP] but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality, that is the best thing for the customer and we work for the user. [SEP] As we move forward, we'll continue to prioritize the customer and user experience in all of our product decisions. We recognize that we have a lot of work to do, but I am confident in our ability to succeed. Thank you all for your continued support.","995":"During the quarter, our team continued to focus on improving our e-commerce offerings. [SEP] When you look at the Instagram Shopping experience, we're seeing some really nice growth. [SEP] We're excited about the potential for Instagram Shopping to continue driving revenue growth in the coming quarters.","996":"Now turning to our engagement metrics. [SEP] And I'd say the character of the engagement growth is a little bit different by region. [SEP] In North America, we're seeing a lot of new sign-ups and repeat customers, while in Asia, we're seeing more engagement from our existing user base.","997":"Now I\u2019d like to turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. [SEP] And then when it comes to how we\u2019re thinking about expense growth as we look beyond 2019, we\u2019re not providing specific guidance but I\u2019d note that we continue to invest aggressively across the business and there\u2019s no change in our long-term outlook on the need to invest heavily in areas like safety and security, innovation in our core product and infrastructure and the ultimate impact that those will have on our operating margin. [SEP] However, we\u2019re also focused on driving efficiencies and finding opportunities to streamline our operations, so we\u2019ll be working hard to strike the right balance between investing and managing costs over the long term.","998":"Our social media platforms continue to experience strong engagement levels as users seek to connect with each other and share their experiences through visual content. [SEP] We have 400 million people sharing with Instagram Stories, 450 million with WhatsApp Status. [SEP] As we continue to focus on enhancing user experience and expanding our reach, we remain optimistic about our ability to drive further growth and monetization opportunities across our platforms.","999":"We're constantly evaluating our marketing strategies to improve our customer engagement and generate more revenue. In the last quarter, we experimented with promoting our products on social media platforms. [SEP] And just the addition of Facebook Stories drove 26% more additions to their checkout cart. [SEP] We're also exploring other ways to leverage social media to drive sales. Our team is currently working on a partnership with Instagram to make our products more accessible to their users. We believe that social media advertising is a powerful tool that should be incorporated into any successful marketing campaign.","1000":"We are now going to discuss the performance of our cloud services division. [SEP] So, our private cloud, premium cue mix is also growing you see that in our results. [SEP] In fact, we are planning to invest more in this area in the coming years to further expand our offerings.","1001":"We recognize the importance of continuously improving our product. [SEP] That's where we spend most of our cycles in. [SEP] By focusing on this area, we believe we can remain competitive in the market.","1002":"Our company has seen a significant shift towards cloud-based solutions in recent months. [SEP] I do believe that every conversation that we're having with customers is cloud-led. [SEP] As we continue to invest in our cloud offerings, we expect our conversations with customers to become even more cloud-focused in the future.","1003":"We've seen significant changes in the industry landscape over the past few months. [SEP] And so I do think that can have an impact in H2. [SEP] However, we're still monitoring the situation closely and staying agile in our strategy.","1004":"During the last quarter, we saw strong growth and engagement across our platforms, both in established and emerging markets. [SEP] I mean, specifically we've made a lot of initiatives to help improve and invest in the Facebook experience in emerging markets and that has helped drive some of the acceleration in growth. [SEP] Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in emerging markets and leverage our technology to bring connectivity and economic opportunities to underserved communities.","1005":"We have seen increasing interest in our product from customers and partners alike. [SEP] And I would imagine that that will come and contribute to our business through advertising in the way that it has historically. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new marketing tactics to further expand our reach and increase brand awareness.","1006":"Now let's take a closer look at our revenue streams for the quarter. [SEP] And in fact, they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances. [SEP] Overall, we are satisfied with our performance this quarter and are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results in the future.","1007":"I want to talk about some of the changes we made last year to improve our operations. [SEP] Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. [SEP] We found that these initiatives were successful in reducing processing times and increasing customer satisfaction, so we plan to continue working with FBA merchants to improve our fulfillment processes going forward.","1008":"Now let's move on to discuss our revenue breakdown by geographic region. [SEP] So we're very bullish on our International business. [SEP] We anticipate continued growth in this area, particularly in Asia where we've seen strong demand for our products.","1009":"Moving on to user engagement, we are pleased to report that our Explore feature has continued to see strong usage. [SEP] More than 200 million people use Explore in order to see content that's interesting to them and interact with people beyond their friends and the people who are \u2013 who they follow directly. [SEP] We're constantly looking for ways to improve the Explore experience and provide our users with even more personalized content recommendations.","1010":"Can you talk a little more about your process for determining what constitutes high quality content on your platform? [SEP] The reality is the way we've done this for years is we've had a panel, a survey of thousands of people who basically we asked what the most meaningful content is that they had seen on the platform or that they've seen off the platform and we design our systems in order to be able to get to that ground truth of what people \u2013 real people are telling us is that high quality experience. [SEP] Have you considered incorporating a more automated system for identifying and promoting high quality content?","1011":"Thank you for the question. We appreciate your interest in our financials. [SEP] The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. [SEP] This reclassification has allowed us to better align our financial reporting with industry standards and provide investors with clearer insights into our operations.","1012":"Our team has been closely monitoring market trends and analyzing user data to determine the cause and potential outcomes of this impact. [SEP] And so, that's going to have an impact on impression rate growth. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to adapt and continue delivering value to our customers through innovative solutions and strategic partnerships.","1013":"We have seen a strong growth in our customer base over the past quarter, and are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum. [SEP] So I think, that's a lot of \u2013 the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands. [SEP] Our team is also actively working on new initiatives to improve our customer experience and drive innovation in our industry.","1014":"Now moving on to our strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] The objective of this is really twofold. [SEP] Firstly, we aim to expand our market share by introducing new products and services, and secondly, we plan to optimize our operational efficiencies to maximize margins.","1015":"Thank you for joining us on this earnings conference call. [SEP] So a number of things have come out recently. [SEP] We would now like to touch on our projected earnings for the next quarter.","1016":"We're excited to share that in the past quarter, our team has really made some significant progress on our partnerships and collaborations. [SEP] We have deals going with Ford on powering the cars of the future, Lyft, Gogo, a lot of really good customer wins in the quarter. [SEP] We're looking forward to continuing to work with these companies and many others to bring our innovative solutions to as many customers as possible.","1017":"We'd like to address some concerns that have been raised about a recent study related to our company's products. [SEP] On the specific report on this study, the study was conducted by a former employee with very incomplete data. [SEP] While we take all studies and reports seriously, we do not believe the conclusions drawn from this study are accurate or representative of the quality of our products.","1018":"One analyst on the call had asked about the company's plans for potential partnerships in the coming year. [SEP] We\u2019re not hanging numbers out there to be measured on at this point, but we don\u2019t do a lot of big partnerships as you probably know. [SEP] Instead, the company typically focuses on developing its own products and technologies, with occasional strategic collaborations with smaller companies.","1019":"One of the questions we often get from our investors and analysts is how much of our costs are coming from different regions we operate in. [SEP] So beyond that, we don\u2019t do geographic cost breakouts and allocations; it\u2019s not how we run the business. [SEP] Instead, we focus on identifying areas of improvement for our overall cost structure and efficiency across all regions, which ultimately benefits the entire company.","1020":"One of the main drivers of our success this quarter has been our focus on our third party sellers. [SEP] And we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers and that\u2019s why you see the results that we're seeing today 44% of our units today, as of this quarter, our third party units, that\u2019s up about 400 basis points from last year. [SEP] We believe that our continued investments in seller tools and programs will only strengthen our third party marketplace and drive even further growth in the future.","1021":"Our financial results for the quarter have exceeded our expectations. [SEP] And so it\u2019s tough to find something in the numbers not to like. [SEP] However, we remain cautious about the economic uncertainties in the coming months.","1022":"As we look at our advertising business, we continue to focus on providing high-quality ads that are relevant and useful to our users. One area where we have seen success in this effort is in our management of ad load and internal promotion units. [SEP] One thing that I would cite there, it's just how we manage ad load and balance some of our internal promotion units and sort of use it as internal house spend and the nature of the changes that we made in that had a more pronounced impact in some of the lower ARPU countries and unlocked more impression growth in those markets. [SEP] We believe that this approach not only benefits our users, but also helps our advertising partners to achieve their desired outcomes. Looking ahead, we plan to continue our focus on optimizing our advertising business to deliver the best possible outcomes for all stakeholders.","1023":"We have seen a lot of changes in the advertising landscape over the past year. [SEP] The way the auction system works is going to just be whatever is the ad that is going to necessarily have the best return is going to win in the auction. [SEP] This means that advertisers need to constantly adapt and adjust their strategies to stay ahead of the competition.","1024":"As we look ahead to the coming year, I want to take a moment to reflect on the impact that our acquisition of GitHub has had on our company. In many ways, it has been a transformative experience for us. [SEP] And quite frankly, primarily I'm excited because for us, as I've always said, GitHub is not a means to some other end. [SEP] Instead, GitHub is an integral part of our mission to empower developers and organizations to build the software solutions of the future. And as we continue to invest in this platform and expand its capabilities, we believe that it will continue to drive significant value for our shareholders and customers alike.","1025":"Our global expansion efforts have continued to drive growth and innovation across all of our businesses. [SEP] The \u2013 we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as two new sites in London for AmazonFresh, and that was the first international location. [SEP] We are confident in the continued success of AmazonFresh and look forward to continuing to expand our presence in international markets.","1026":"Now let's move on to our advertising segment. [SEP] on pricing growth, I think there we feel like we're making good progress in our goal of driving better outcomes in ROI for our advertisers through things like better targeting, better ad units, driving better conversion, and improving measurement. [SEP] Our data also shows that engagement rates have improved significantly in the last quarter, which we view as a positive indicator of our efforts to improve ad quality.","1027":"Now let's turn our attention to the growth in our sharing features. [SEP] As I said, the vast majority or the majority of the growth that we're seeing in sharing is coming from private messaging and story sharing. [SEP] We believe that the popularity of these features is a result of their ability to facilitate more intimate and personal connections between users.","1028":"We have observed an increase in our marketing spend this quarter. [SEP] because they want to get a message out. [SEP] Our goal is to increase brand awareness and reach new customers through various advertising channels.","1029":"Our online advertising revenue on desktop has been impacted by ad blockers. [SEP] We're always going be in a back-and-forth with ad blockers on the desktop side. [SEP] However, we are exploring new strategies to combat this challenge and maintain our revenue growth.","1030":"We have received questions about the total number of employees at Facebook and our partner companies. [SEP] So on the first one, the 10,000 number, that encompasses both employees at Facebook and also employees at partners, so it's not all Facebook employees. [SEP] We believe that partnerships are a key part of our business strategy, and we are proud to work with talented individuals from a variety of organizations.","1031":"We have been closely monitoring our financial performance over the past quarter to determine areas where we can improve profitability. [SEP] Our primary consideration is always around maximizing gross margin dollars, and that is the approach that we take around for example pricing decisions. [SEP] However, we also prioritize providing value to our customers and maintaining competitive prices in the market.","1032":"Can you speak to how customer behavior has changed? [SEP] Clearly, how they've used our service has evolved over the years. [SEP] What steps are we taking to keep up with these changes and ensure we continue to meet their needs?","1033":"During the quarter, we generated strong cash flows of $5.4 billion. We returned a total of $7.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. [SEP] So the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends but we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily. [SEP] Our priority remains to create value for our shareholders, and we will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy. However, we believe that the current market conditions provide an attractive opportunity for us to continue buying back shares. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","1034":"Now, let's take a closer look at our revenue breakdown.

[SEP] This is an important distinction from our competitors, as it allows for flexibility and scalability as businesses continue to evolve their technology needs.","1040":"Our focus for the next quarter is on growing our user base and improving user engagement.

[SEP] In fact, we have already seen a significant increase in click-through rates and engagement since implementing these new methods.","1051":"We're really pleased with the progress we've made in our cloud computing division over the past year. [SEP] But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business. [SEP] That's a significant milestone for us and gives us great confidence in the future of this segment of our business.","1052":"I'd like to now turn our attention to our data and AI initiatives.

Many people believe that there is a \"right\" way to run a business, a formula that ensures success. But the reality is much more complex than that. [SEP] The other one is that there is no such thing as a canonical business. [SEP] Every company is unique, with its own challenges, strengths, and weaknesses. What works for one organization may not work for another, and there is no single strategy that guarantees success. We need to approach each situation with an open mind and a willingness to adapt our approach to fit the circumstances.","1059":"One analyst asked about the company's year-over-year growth and how it compared to the previous year's results.

Thank you all for your continued support and we look forward to updating you again soon.","1069":"Moving onto our segmentation analysis, let's take a closer look at our revenue streams. [SEP] And the things that have huge growth rates there are the other products category, which is our wearables business in China and the services business, which you and I just spoke about. [SEP] Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of these categories and anticipate continued growth in the coming year.","1070":"Now I'd like to discuss our upcoming product releases.

[SEP] We believe these features and enhancements will greatly benefit our customers and improve their experience with our software.","1071":"Our team has noticed some interesting trends in user behavior across different devices that we want to share with you today. [SEP] On desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos that they took from their digital camera and downloaded onto their computer; whereas on mobile, the more common behavior is to take a single photo or a couple and just post those. [SEP] This shift towards more frequent, but smaller uploads has impacted the way we design and develop our platform to better accommodate this behavior.","1072":"We've been seeing a significant shift in the market towards cloud-based solutions.

[SEP] It's really about a transformation of the entire customer experience, including how they interact with our products and services.","1073":"We've seen solid growth in our core business and have been able to maintain a strong margin. Looking ahead, however, there are a few areas of our portfolio that may require closer attention. [SEP] So while I'm confident in our ability to continue to grow the core margin, I do think for us in particular, it really is a portfolio that we believe that we need to manage appropriately. [SEP] We're constantly evaluating the performance of each segment of our business, and sometimes that means making tough decisions about where to allocate resources. But overall, I'm optimistic about our ability to navigate these challenges and continue delivering value to our customers and shareholders.","1074":"We have been investing heavily in improving our content moderation system. [SEP] But ultimately, if you want to get those high-quality judgments today on sensitive content and you want to do it quickly when the stakes are pretty high in terms of taking down content or leaving things up, and we take that extremely seriously, you want people to be looking at that. [SEP] That's why we have a team of highly trained content moderators working around the clock to ensure that we get it right every time.","1075":"We are pleased to report strong results for the holiday season. In particular, our digital marketing campaigns performed exceptionally well, driving significant traffic and sales.

I want to address concerns about the decline in unit sales this quarter. [SEP] So I have long believed that on 90 day clock on unit sales is a very surface way to view Apple. [SEP] As I have stated numerous times before, our focus is not on short-term gains, but rather on building long-term customer loyalty. This is why we focus on delivering superior customer experiences and providing innovative products. Our strong brand reputation and customer loyalty are what put us ahead of the competition and keep us relevant in the market.","1077":"Our next question comes from John Smith, an analyst from ABC Investments. [SEP] But as I said, one of the key things is, architecturally, the way we build Azure, the way we build Office 365, the way we build our gaming cloud and the way we build even Dynamics are all pretty much one architecture. [SEP] This unification allows us to leverage the resources of each of these platforms to create a more seamless experience for our customers. It also enables us to innovate faster and deliver new features more efficiently. We believe this architecture will continue to be a significant competitive advantage for us as we look to grow our cloud business and expand our offerings across various industries.","1078":"We've had a lot of success working with our clients over the past quarter, especially in driving sales and increasing brand awareness.

[SEP] Part of that is on HomePod but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad, and so I think home is important. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and improve our existing products and develop new ones, we're confident that we'll be able to meet the needs of our customers in the home market.","1081":"Our team has been working tirelessly to improve the user experience on our platform. [SEP] If you go back a few years and you tried to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watched it, which wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared. [SEP] Today, we are proud to say that videos on our platform load almost instantly, making it the preferred method of sharing content for our users.","1082":"We have been receiving a lot of interest from our customers regarding hybrid cloud solutions.

We've made significant investments in this area, and it's paying off. [SEP] So you'll see that, we reported subscription services revenue increased 26% when you exclude FX.

Overall, we feel good about the trajectory of this business and its potential for continued growth.","1085":"In response to a question about market competition. [SEP] So look, I mean I think for all the concern about whether there is enough competition, the space today continues to be incredibly competitive. [SEP] We remain focused on differentiating our products and services to stay ahead of the competition and capture market share.","1086":"Our company strategy has always been to diversify our portfolio of products and services.

[SEP] Our team is constantly monitoring foreign exchange rates and adjusting our strategies accordingly to continue to drive revenue growth.","1089":"When we look at our sales performance for the past year, there are several factors that contributed to our growth. [SEP] One of them is the fact that last year in January we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent channel sale for China Mobile.

[SEP] In fact, we're seeing significant cost savings now that we've shifted the majority of our workload to the cloud.","1093":"Our new marketing campaign has been performing well and driving brand awareness. [SEP] We're also seeing a lot of strength in brand. [SEP] We plan to continue investing in brand-building efforts to further grow our customer base.","1094":"Can you talk about how your ad targeting and placement strategies have evolved across different Facebook platforms? For example, how do you approach ad placement in News Feed versus Instagram? [SEP] So the right ad in News Feed is different than the right ad in an Instagram or a Facebook story is different than the right ad in Watch, which would be video-only. [SEP] As you continue to expand your suite of products and platforms, how do you plan to ensure that advertisers can effectively target their audiences in each unique environment?","1095":"Thank you for joining us today on our earnings conference call.

We've included a simple drag-and-drop interface that allows you to customize your site without ever touching a line of code. We can't wait to see what you create with it!","1100":"We're happy to report strong numbers for this quarter, with revenue growth of 15% year-over-year. We continue to see great demand for our iPhone lineup, with our latest model performing particularly well. [SEP] It's the fact that we are having the iPhone SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a downward pressure on ASP. [SEP] However, we anticipate that the iPhone SE will attract a different segment of the market, one that is more price-sensitive. While this may impact our average selling price, we believe that it will also help us to expand our customer base and drive overall sales growth. Additionally, we are confident that our upcoming product launches will help to offset any potential decrease in ASP.","1101":"Our company has always been committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, and we've taken steps to ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR. In fact, we see GDPR as an opportunity to build trust with our customers by being transparent about our data practices. [SEP] We - the basic - the principles behind GDPR in Europe, I think we're very important, and I think having that codified around the world would be a very positive step. [SEP] Of course, there are challenges to implementing GDPR-like regulations on a global scale, and we'll need to work with regulators and industry leaders to make it happen. But we believe that this is the right direction for our industry, and we're committed to leading the way in data privacy and security. Thank you for your time today.","1102":"We have been making significant investments in our productivity suite of products. [SEP] But I think I look at this and say, at a 37% growth rate, plus some of the integrations we've seen and the growth in uses and users of things like Outlook Mobile, I believe that we're probably a little bit on the front end of the revenue synergies you'll see in product over time. [SEP] We are optimistic about the potential for continued growth and revenue synergies as we expand our product offerings and enhance the user experience.","1103":"Our advertising revenue has been increasing steadily over the past few quarters. However, we still have some room for improvement in this area.

[SEP] So, it was really important to me, and I think to making \u2013 to the long term of what our product stands for it to make sure that News Feed is always about meaningful interaction. [SEP] We have been working on implementing changes to our algorithm to prioritize posts from friends and family and limit the visibility of clickbait and fake news.","1113":"We are pleased to report that our company's performance this quarter has been strong. [SEP] Third party units continue to grow, advertising dollars continue to grow very well. [SEP] We anticipate that this growth trend will continue and lead to increased revenue and profits.","1114":"We're really excited about the progress we've made in our advertising business. We've seen strong growth in both our number of advertisers and total ad impressions. [SEP] As we connect more advertisers with those and bring more data into the system and we can get more of the impressions that are very highly targeted and very relevant, then we'll be rewarded with better pricing as we can expand that out into things like Lookalikes. [SEP] Our team is focused on continuously improving our data and targeting capabilities to drive better results for our advertisers. And as we continue to innovate and expand our offerings, we believe we'll be well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing shift towards digital advertising.","1115":"Thank you for joining us for our earnings conference call.

[SEP] We are focusing on reducing our inventory levels in the coming quarter to optimize our cash flow and improve our margins. Despite the inventory challenge, I am pleased with the progress we have made in our cost-saving initiatives and our ability to adapt to the current market conditions. Thank you for your time today and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.","1116":"We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our customers' data, and we will continue to work closely with regulators and policymakers to achieve this goal. [SEP] But in terms of for the market overall, I just think it would be a lot better if we had a very clear set of rules at the federal level on privacy. [SEP] This is not only important for our business and our customers, but for the entire industry as a whole. We believe that a consistent and transparent framework for data privacy is essential for building trust and promoting innovation in the digital economy. We will continue to advocate for such a framework in our discussions with lawmakers and other stakeholders.","1117":"During the quarter, we invested a lot of resources into improving our camera features on our platform. We wanted to offer our users the best possible experience when capturing and sharing their favorite moments. [SEP] So we were competing there with things like Facebook camera, but we ultimately thought that we were going to do better work if we were building with Instagram. [SEP] Our decision to focus on Instagram has paid off. We've seen significant growth in user engagement and have received positive feedback on our camera updates. We will continue to prioritize improving our camera and other key features on Instagram to meet the evolving needs of our users.","1118":"As we look to the future, our focus remains on growth and innovation. [SEP] We are also continuing to invest in areas like community operations and other areas. [SEP] These investments will help us to enhance the overall user experience and strengthen our position in the market.","1119":"Moving on to our marketing strategies for the quarter, we've had some exciting developments on both the digital and brand side. [SEP] And then on the brand side itself, we have new reporting - excuse me, where we're again looking to measure the new to the brand shoppers and what lift they're seeing. [SEP] Overall, the initial results from our new reporting have been promising, revealing a significant increase in new customers who were introduced to our brand through our recent promotions and campaigns.","1120":"Can you talk about your outlook for your E3 offering moving forward? [SEP] So we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3. [SEP] And can you provide any updates on how the sales team is approaching upselling current customers to E3?","1121":"Can you tell us about your new product development strategy? [SEP] And rather than just relying on our own intuition, although we do rely on that a lot, we will try to put it out in the market and get feedback and then roll it out from there. [SEP] Do you have any specific examples of times when this approach has led to successful product launches?\" \n\n\"And rather than just relying on our own intuition, although we do rely on that a lot, we will try to put it out in the market and get feedback and then roll it out from there. By doing this, we're able to get a more accurate read on what customers want and are willing to pay for. It also helps us identify any potential issues early on and make necessary adjustments before wide-scale launch.","1122":"Our company has been closely monitoring user-generated content on our platform and its impact on the community. [SEP] The reactive model of waiting for people in the community to flag them guarantees that by the time that we get to look at an issue someone has already seen that content, which is not the state that we want to be in. [SEP] To address this concern, we are implementing an AI-based content moderation system that proactively identifies problematic content and removes it before it reaches a wider audience.","1123":"During the quarter, we experienced a significant increase in our political spending segment. [SEP] On the political spending, our business is broad-based, encompassing federal, state, and local elections. We have a strong track record of working with campaigns across the political spectrum. [SEP] As we look ahead to the next election cycle, we remain confident in our ability to continue partnering with campaigns and providing impactful advertising solutions.","1124":"We've received a lot of questions regarding our plans for expanding our network. I want to assure our shareholders that we are actively working towards that goal. [SEP] On the other part of your question, we continue to work on the network around the world, but I can't respond to any of the rumors and speculation. [SEP] However, we have to consider a multitude of factors before making any announcements. These include regulatory approvals, market demand, and investment costs. Rest assured, our team is diligently working on a plan that will benefit both our company and our customers.","1125":"During the last quarter, we saw a significant increase in demand for our products. [SEP] The guidance is $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and that's up from $1.8 billion last year. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue and are confident in our ability to meet or exceed our guidance for the year.","1126":"We're excited to share our company's growth strategy with all of you on this earnings call. [SEP] You can tell by that we\u2019re a big believer in China. [SEP] We've seen incredible success in our expansion into the Chinese market, and we plan to continue investing in this important region for years to come.","1127":"Our team has been closely monitoring user behavior on our platform. [SEP] In the US, I think it was less video and more core feed engagement. [SEP] This is encouraging as it aligns with our strategy to focus on building deeper connections and engagement between users.","1128":"Now I'd like to turn to our business segment performance. [SEP] It's really as we talked about transactional weakness in Productivity and Business Process. [SEP] However, we are seeing strong growth in our Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing sectors, which is offsetting some of the weakness in Productivity and Business Process.","1129":"We've seen a lot of growth in our advertising revenue this quarter, but we are also excited about the potential of our subscription-based content offerings. [SEP] And now the third class of content, which I think is going to be important and increasingly important over time is the one that you basically want to essentially trade the content for money, and that is one where you need the rev share to unlock that. [SEP] We are working on developing more exclusive content that will fit into this category and provide a valuable revenue stream for our company.","1130":"We've seen a steady increase in customer satisfaction ratings over the past quarter. [SEP] So we're happy with the engagement that customers have. [SEP] In fact, our Net Promoter Score has gone up by 10 points since we started implementing our new loyalty program.","1131":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. [SEP] It did pull forward a bit of revenue into Q2. [SEP] However, we anticipate this will not have a significant impact on our overall earnings for the remainder of the year.","1132":"Can you provide more insight into the company's growth strategy? [SEP] Yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. [SEP] We've also been investing in our online bookstore to complement our physical locations.","1133":"We continue to innovate and expand our offerings to better serve our customers. [SEP] We've also added Lockers, and much more to come. [SEP] Our goal is to provide a seamless and convenient experience for all of our customers, whether they are shopping in-store or online.","1134":"We have shifted the focus of our advertising strategy to more targeted marketing efforts. [SEP] because when they're more targeted, they have higher returns for marketers and they're more enjoyable or relevant for people. [SEP] As a result, we have seen a significant increase in engagement and conversion rates from our advertising campaigns.","1135":"Analyst: \"Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to circle back on the guidance for the upcoming quarters. Given the recent industry trends and the pandemic, are you seeing anything new that could impact your outlook? [SEP] And so I'm not sure there's anything quote-unquote new, Karl, I would say, other than that bit of mix between OEM Pro, a little bit pulled into Q2 versus Q3. [SEP] CEO: \"Overall, we remain confident in our financial outlook for the year. We're seeing strong demand for our products across multiple sectors. In fact, we just closed a major deal with a Fortune 500 company to provide our software solution for their entire workforce. This will have a positive impact on our revenue starting in Q4. And so I'm not sure there's anything quote-unquote new, Karl, I would say, other than that bit of mix between OEM Pro, a little bit pulled into Q2 versus Q3.","1136":"Let's now turn to our robotics division for an update. [SEP] At the end of 2014, we had 15,000 bots, so we've doubled that amount and they were in 10 warehouses. [SEP] Our goal for next year is to expand our bot fleet to 40,000 and have them operating in 20 warehouses.","1137":"Our financial results for this quarter have been impressive, with revenue growth exceeding our expectations. [SEP] The infrastructure team has done an outstanding job in driving good efficiencies through things like the Open Compute Project, which allows us to leverage an open-source strategy to lower our costs on server and other expensive hardware. [SEP] As we continue to focus on cost reduction efforts, we remain committed to finding innovative solutions that help us scale while keeping expenses in check.","1138":"We've received a lot of feedback from our customers regarding their desire for more flexibility and convenience in purchasing our products. [SEP] That's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call and so we are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today. [SEP] We believe that offering recurring payment options and easier access to new products will ultimately drive greater customer loyalty and increase sales for our company.","1139":"We've seen really strong growth in our e-commerce division this quarter. [SEP] Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. [SEP] We're excited to continue supporting Souq's expansion and growth in the region.","1140":"Investor 1: \"Can you explain the decline in revenue from last quarter?\" \nInvestor 2: \"I noticed a drop in our market share. Do you have any plans to address this?\" \n\nCEO: \"I mean there are a couple of different things here. Let me break it down for you. [SEP] I mean there are a couple of different things here. [SEP] CEO: \"Firstly, the decline in revenue is due to a dip in demand for our flagship product. We are currently working on developing new products to diversify our offerings and boost revenue. As for the drop in market share, we have identified several areas where we can improve our marketing strategy and have already begun implementing changes.\" \n\nInvestor 1: \"That sounds promising. Do you have any projections for when we can expect to see a turnaround in revenue?\" \n\nCEO: \"We are optimistic about the future and expect to see positive results within the next quarter.\" \n\nInvestor 2: \"Great, thank you for the update.","1141":"We have been working on improving our product offering in order to stay competitive in the market. [SEP] And so all of those are important [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new business opportunities in order to increase revenue growth for the company.\" \n\n\"And so all of those are important. Improving our product offering and expanding into new business opportunities will help us maintain our position in the market and grow our revenue.","1142":"Can you give us an update on where you see the company headed in the next year? [SEP] I'm not -- we haven\u2019t even completed the first inning yet. [SEP] So we're still in the early stages of implementing our strategic plan and there is a lot of potential for growth in the coming quarters.","1143":"We've seen remarkable growth in our online sales platform over the past year,\" the CEO reported to investors during the earnings conference call. [SEP] And then, not stopping there, but going to other devices, for example mobile. [SEP] Our team has been working diligently to optimize our mobile app, which we believe will be an important driver of revenue growth in the years to come,\" the CEO continued.","1144":"We're very pleased with the performance of our Xbox business this quarter. It's been a standout performer for us and we continue to see strong demand for our consoles and content. [SEP] So when you see some of the KPIs and some of the strength you saw in quarter, that's the foundation of Xbox. [SEP] We're also excited about the upcoming launch of our new Xbox Series X console later this year. We believe it will be a game-changer for the industry and we're confident it will further strengthen our position in the market.","1145":"Our revenue growth has been phenomenal this year. We are proud to announce that our year-over-year growth has exceeded expectations. [SEP] It's like 100% year-over-year. [SEP] This growth can be attributed to our successful product launches and strong customer retention. We look forward to continuing this momentum in the upcoming fiscal year.","1146":"We will now take a question from the audience. [SEP] Next, I think across every service the momentum we\u2019ve seen in Q4 and in particular, I would say, I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows E5, advanced threat protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings. [SEP] Can you provide any details on what specific areas you are seeing the most growth in?","1147":"In terms of competition, we continue to monitor the market closely and remain focused on delivering quality products and services to our customers. We understand that pricing is an important consideration for consumers, but it is not the only factor. [SEP] While pricing is certainly a factor we don't believe it's always the primary factor [SEP] Our research has shown that customers also value convenience, reliability, and customer service. Therefore, we strive to provide a well-rounded experience that meets all of these needs. By focusing on these key areas, we have been able to maintain a loyal customer base and attract new ones, despite the competitive landscape.","1148":"We understand that there may be concerns regarding our performance and growth in China recently. [SEP] Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future. [SEP] We are committed to investing in this market and are exploring new strategies to increase our presence and appeal to Chinese consumers.","1149":"We are closely monitoring geopolitical risks as they may impact our business operations globally. [SEP] There are big elections, not just the U.S. midterms, but the major elections upcoming in Mexico, in Brazil, in India, and Pakistan, and a number of other countries around the world. [SEP] We have developed contingency plans to mitigate potential disruption to our supply chains and production facilities. Despite these uncertainties, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects and are committed to delivering value to our shareholders.","1150":"We have seen some great growth over the last few quarters, and I know many of you are interested in the details behind that growth. [SEP] Yeah, what I can tell you is that yes, the unit growth has been reaccelerated in the last two quarters and actually Amazon Fulfilled unit growth is growing at a higher clip. [SEP] We are confident that this growth trend will continue, and we believe there are still many untapped opportunities for us to pursue. With the support of our dedicated team and our commitment to innovation, we are excited to see what the future holds for our company.","1151":"We prioritize customer satisfaction and aim to provide the highest level of service possible. [SEP] so it is a fundamental part of our business model. [SEP] We believe that by focusing on our customers' needs and delivering value, we can sustain long-term growth and success.","1152":"I'd now like to turn our attention to our efforts to improve user engagement and increase revenue. [SEP] But we continue to make changes to improve and to optimize around driving meaningful social interactions as Mark talked about. [SEP] We believe these changes will not only benefit our users, but also result in sustained growth for our platform.","1153":"As we look towards the future, let's discuss the impact of the current trade tensions on our business outlook. [SEP] On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press. [SEP] However, we must remain cautious as these tensions can escalate quickly and have a significant effect on our bottom line.","1154":"We conducted a thorough review of our inventory to ensure that it is streamlined and efficient. [SEP] And we'd look at it and take things down that didn't belong. [SEP] As a result of this process, we have already seen a significant improvement in our overall profitability.","1155":"We have seen strong performance in Q3 and are optimistic that we can carry that momentum into the final quarter. [SEP] So that\u2019s a little bit more on our guidance, but again we are really looking forward to Q4. [SEP] We have several exciting product launches planned for Q4 and believe they will have a positive impact on our revenue.","1156":"We have been closely monitoring our performance metrics and are pleased to report some exciting developments. [SEP] That is really showing a lot of good traction for us, but we're also seeing traction in analytics and voice. [SEP] Our team has been working diligently to optimize these areas and we are seeing some promising results.","1157":"Our sales team has been actively working on identifying ways to increase sales of lower ASP items. We have been experimenting with different strategies over the past six months. [SEP] So you know there has been some reduction in the threshold for some lower ASP items that we\u2019ve been doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, especially over the long term. [SEP] Our goal is not just to increase sales in the short term, but to also ensure customer satisfaction in the long term. We believe that by reducing the threshold for lower ASP items, we are making our offerings accessible to a wider range of customers and meeting their needs.","1158":"Moving onto our financial results for this quarter... [SEP] In terms of what drove the improvement in the pricing, it's strong demand, so that's playing through in the face of a little bit slower supply growth. [SEP] We are also optimistic about our future outlook as we continue to see positive trends in the market.","1159":"We have some exciting projects in the pipeline that we believe will drive growth for our company. [SEP] And we think with the cash flow that we're generating, we have a strong financial position with which to fund that. [SEP] Additionally, we plan to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that will complement our current offerings and support our long-term goals.","1160":"We are seeing strong demand for our products and services, particularly in the online retail space. [SEP] So it's -- that increase in one-day shipping and all the associated cost of additional transportation and getting capacity in place. [SEP] However, we believe that the investments we are making in this area will ultimately lead to greater customer satisfaction and retention, as we strive to provide faster and more convenient delivery options.","1161":"Our iPhone upgrade program has been a huge success and has helped to drive growth in our subscriber base. [SEP] There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans, where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. [SEP] Despite increased competition in this area, we are confident in our ability to maintain our market position and continue to offer innovative products and services to our customers.","1162":"We have seen strong revenue growth in the past quarter due to our strategic pricing and marketing efforts. [SEP] Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. [SEP] However, we continue to explore options for expanding our first-party sales to states that do not have a state-imposed sales tax.","1163":"Now let's talk about some of the key factors behind our earnings growth this quarter. [SEP] And the third is Facebook \u2013 our own product changes. [SEP] We've made some significant updates to the platform, including improved privacy settings and new advertising options, which we believe will drive continued user engagement and revenue growth.","1164":"During the last quarter, our advertising revenue increased by 10%, which is a reflection of our ongoing efforts to improve our advertising strategies. [SEP] But obviously, if you have rising prices, it's going to make that work against an upstream trend, so we need to continue to work hard to deliver more value for advertisers in the face of that. [SEP] We are also exploring new ways to improve our ad targeting capabilities and provide more personalized ads to users, which we believe will further drive advertising revenue growth in the future.","1165":"Our innovative technology platform is the backbone of our success in the industry. [SEP] It allows us and locks for a same day and next-day deliveries. [SEP] In the past quarter, we saw a significant increase in demand for our same-day delivery services, which contributed to our strong revenue growth.","1166":"As we discuss our quarterly results, I would like to draw your attention to some important updates related to our accounting policies. We have recently adopted a new revenue recognition standard, which has resulted in some changes to our financial reporting. [SEP] Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. [SEP] However, we believe that the impact of this change is minor and will not have a material effect on our financial performance over the long term. In fact, we are confident that our revenues will continue to grow steadily in the coming quarters, driven by strong demand for our products and services. Thank you for your attention, and now I will turn it over to our CFO to provide more details on our financial results.","1167":"We have seen a tremendous increase in demand for our Prime platform over the last few quarters. [SEP] And again, so we're going to continue feed the Prime platform as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories. [SEP] Our goal is to ensure that Prime members have access to the widest selection of products and services possible.","1168":"Our company has always placed great emphasis on innovation and staying ahead of the curve.\n- As we continue to grow and evolve as a business, we recognize the need to stay competitive in the tech marketplace.\n- In the past, we relied heavily on third-party vendors and contractors for our technology needs. [SEP] We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make. [SEP] By developing more of our technology in-house, we can ensure that our products and services are built to our precise specifications and standards.\n- We're also able to respond more quickly to changes in the market and customer needs, rather than waiting for third-party providers to make updates or adjustments.\n- We're excited about the potential of our in-house technology team and the contributions they'll make to our overall success.","1169":"Our advertising team has been working tirelessly to expand our reach and increase our return on investment. [SEP] Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook Pixels to measure the incremental sales, and got to a 9.7 times return on ad sales. [SEP] We are thrilled with these results and will continue to seek out new opportunities to connect with our target audience.","1170":"Our new product line has been on the market for a few weeks now, and we've been closely monitoring customer feedback. We're pleased to report that the initial response has been overwhelmingly positive. [SEP] We like the response that we've seen so far. [SEP] As we continue to ramp up production and expand distribution, we expect sales growth to accelerate even further. We're confident that our new products will continue to exceed our customers' expectations and drive strong revenue growth for the company.","1171":"We were able to successfully expand into several new international markets this quarter. Our international team worked hard to conduct thorough research into each market and develop localized strategies. [SEP] And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe our efforts to adapt our pricing strategy to each unique market paid off in increased revenue and customer loyalty. Moving forward, we plan to continue taking this approach as we consider further expansion into new markets.","1172":"One of the questions we received a lot is about how our sales are doing in China. [SEP] I would also say, it's not all about iPhone in China, the services area grew double digit. [SEP] Our team in China has been doing a fantastic job of developing and promoting our services like Apple Music and iCloud, which have seen strong adoption rates among Chinese consumers.","1173":"We've had a lot of success with our Prime Now service. [SEP] Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. [SEP] It allows us to quickly enter new markets and offer customers a faster delivery option.","1174":"We saw strong performance in our financial services division this quarter. Our trading volumes were higher than expected, driven by increased market activity and strong demand from our clients. [SEP] And volume -- one-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter. [SEP] As a result, we were able to achieve record revenue and earnings for the quarter. We remain optimistic about our future growth prospects, particularly as we continue to invest in new products and services to meet our clients' evolving needs.","1175":"We've been investing heavily in our data analytics capabilities, building out our product catalog, and improving our site and app interfaces to make them more user-friendly. [SEP] But what our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. [SEP] We're also exploring opportunities to expand our offerings into new and complementary product categories that align with our customers' interests and preferences. By doing so, we hope to deepen our relationship with them and drive greater lifetime customer value.","1176":"Our team has been working diligently to optimize costs without sacrificing performance. We understand that cloud consumption can be a significant expense, which is why we are thrilled to announce this news today. [SEP] In fact, you can think of it as a price cut for anybody who cares about being very, very smart about cloud consumption [SEP] This price cut is only one example of our commitment to providing our customers with value and savings. We will continue to innovate and find new ways to improve efficiency and lower costs on the cloud. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our company.","1177":"Our sales team has been working tirelessly to promote and push the iPhone X to our customers. [SEP] But I would tell you that we\u2019re thrilled with the reception of iPhone X. [SEP] We've seen a significant uptick in sales and customer satisfaction surveys indicate that users are extremely pleased with their iPhone X experience.","1178":"I want to take a moment now to discuss our advertising revenue growth for Q2. [SEP] So what you're seeing in our results right now are very strong growth for Facebook and very strong growth for Instagram. [SEP] We're seeing an increasing number of businesses utilizing Instagram to connect with their customers, which is contributing significantly to our overall revenue growth.","1179":"We are excited to announce the release of our latest product, which we believe will revolutionize the market. [SEP] It is a new product for us, and with any kind of new product, you wind up taking some time to fully ramp. [SEP] However, we are confident that once we have fully ramped up, this product will exceed our expectations and become a key source of revenue for the company.","1180":"We have analyzed the market trends and we are very optimistic about the potential for growth in this sector. [SEP] So we just see that there is a lot of upside there. [SEP] Our team is already working on developing new strategies to capitalize on these opportunities and expand our market share.","1181":"Can you provide a comparison between our current market performance and that of last year?\"\n- \"I noticed that our competitors have been struggling in certain areas. Can you speak to how we are different in those aspects? [SEP] So they are very different situations. [SEP] However, we have still been able to maintain steady growth and expansion.\"\n- \"Despite these differences, we are actively monitoring and adjusting our strategies to ensure continued success.","1182":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. I am pleased to report that we exceeded our earnings expectations, with a net income of $1.2 billion. [SEP] But its $800 -- excuse me $800 million lower depreciation expense in the quarter and it will be consistent. [SEP] This decrease in depreciation expense is largely due to our recent investment in upgraded equipment and technology, which has increased our efficiency and reduced the need for costly maintenance. We expect this trend to continue, providing a valuable cost savings for our company in the coming quarters.","1183":"Thank you for that question. We've noticed some changes in our sales cycles recently, particularly in the cloud segment. [SEP] Now over any short-term period, the majority of what we have seen is really either a budget constraint, a macroeconomic change, or people, to the question you've laid out, maybe in the midst of making their cloud transition plan, and maybe that has elongated the sales cycle to an extent. [SEP] However, we're confident that our long-term strategy is on track and we will continue to see growth in this area. We are working closely with our customers to help them navigate their cloud transition plans and are seeing positive results as a result of these efforts.","1184":"We have received a lot of questions about our plans for monetizing WhatsApp, so I'd like to address that now. [SEP] We are not rolling out any monetization products on WhatsApp right now, but we did start that process at F8 on Messenger. [SEP] We believe that it's important to approach monetization in a thoughtful way that respects user privacy and ensures that our products enhance the overall user experience.","1185":"We experienced a significant increase in expenses due to unexpected legal fees in the last quarter. [SEP] yes, obviously this is a one-off item that affected the December quarter. [SEP] Moving forward, we have implemented measures to ensure that our legal expenses remain manageable and do not affect our bottom line in the future.","1186":"Can you talk about the impacts on your bottom line of adding new capacity to the network? [SEP] But on the cost side, yes it\u2019s going to be the route density and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down, but for now, there is certainly some start-up paying in adding new capacity. [SEP] However, we believe that this investment is necessary to meet the growing demand for our services and ultimately drive long-term profitability.","1187":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the use of our messaging apps, particularly WhatsApp. The number of users who made voice and video calls on WhatsApp also continued to grow. [SEP] And I think that that's just going to continue growing and I'm really looking forward to getting the first stats on WhatsApp VoIP as well soon. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters as more people work and communicate remotely. Additionally, we are exploring ways to monetize our messaging platforms, including potentially offering paid features or advertisements, which could further drive revenue growth.","1188":"We've been focused on innovation and investing in our products for the long term. [SEP] If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to deliver new features and capabilities that we think our customers are going to love.","1189":"We've had some questions from investors about how we plan to continue growing our revenue in such a competitive advertising market. [SEP] And so what's really most important in winning budgets is our relative performance versus other opportunities presented to marketers. [SEP] We're confident that our unique targeting capabilities and innovative ad formats will continue to differentiate us from the competition and drive strong results for our clients.","1190":"We're excited about the progress we've made over the past quarter and the opportunities ahead of us. One area we see strong potential in is our business application segment. [SEP] And I think about the combination of both Dynamics 365 as well as what we're doing on the LinkedIn side. [SEP] The integration of Dynamics 365 with LinkedIn's Sales Navigator has yielded positive results for our customers. We're constantly looking at ways to further leverage the strengths of both platforms to drive growth and create value for our stakeholders.","1191":"We're excited to announce that we've reached over 2 billion monthly active users across our platforms.

[SEP] We think our growth has been very broad-based [SEP] and we are optimistic about the future as we continue to innovate and expand our offerings to customers.","1203":"We'd now like to open the call up to questions from analysts and investors. [SEP] And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market, but given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone, but iPad as well.

[SEP] We were up 71% year over year. [SEP] This growth can primarily be attributed to our successful marketing campaigns and expansion into new markets.","1206":"Now let's discuss the performance of our different segments.

Thank you for joining us today.","1208":"When it comes to ad load, we're constantly looking for ways to optimize our platforms. [SEP] so there is an opportunity for us to continue to grow ad load on Instagram probably beyond \u2013 in a longer timeframe than there is on Facebook because of that disparity in terms of where they are today. [SEP] Of course, we want to be careful not to compromise user experience, but we believe we can find a sweet spot that benefits both our advertisers and our community.","1209":"We have seen growth in our sales over the past quarter, which is a positive signal for our business.

[SEP] We believe that our continued focus on innovation, coupled with our strong relationships with our customers, will keep us on this positive trajectory.","1214":"Can you give us some insight into your company's strategy for hybrid computing? [SEP] When I think about hybrid computing at least in the fullness of time, it's more the future of distributed computing, where there is a cloud, there is an edge. [SEP] And how do you see your company positioning itself in this future landscape of distributed computing?","1215":"As we continue to innovate and improve our products and services, we are embracing emerging technologies to enhance the customer experience. [SEP] And certainly AI is going to be a big part of that both on the vision side and the voice side. [SEP] We have invested heavily in research and development to integrate AI into our platform, and we believe this will further differentiate us from our competitors.","1216":"A question from an analyst on the call asked about the company's ability to personalize content recommendations for users based on their interests. [SEP] But there's no reason that we shouldn't be able to match you up with any of the millions of pieces of content that you might be interested in that gets shared on Facebook every day, except for the fact that we don't have the AI technology to know what those are about and if they match your interest today. [SEP] However, our team is working diligently to develop and implement AI technology that will not only identify interests but also tailor recommendations based on user behavior and activity.","1217":"During the quarter, we experienced a decline in our overall sales, particularly in our key markets. [SEP] Then of course, I would say by far the largest impact on margins for the quarter is the loss of leverage, which as we've discussed is a result of lower sales volumes. [SEP] To address this, we are implementing cost-cutting measures and exploring new growth opportunities to regain our leverage and improve our margins in the coming quarters.","1218":"Our company has been exploring different avenues for expansion, and we believe that there is a huge potential in the market for virtual reality (VR) technology. Today, we want to share our plans with you regarding our VR platform. [SEP] In terms of the actual content, first, we think gaming is going to be the most obvious market. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to develop a range of immersive experiences that are specifically designed for VR gaming. We believe that this market has enormous potential for growth, particularly as the technology becomes more widely accessible. In fact, we're already seeing strong demand for our platform from gamers all over the world.","1219":"As the head of product development, my team and I have been researching and developing new offerings in the market. [SEP] I've seen consumer solutions. [SEP] However, I believe that our company's expertise lies in enterprise solutions, which have significantly higher profit margins and greater potential for growth.","1220":"We have seen a significant shift in our cost structure over the last year, which has impacted our financial performance. However, we have also made strategic investments in key areas that we believe will drive growth in the long-term.

[SEP] We continue to monitor the market closely and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that our cost structure remains competitive. Overall, we are pleased with our progress and are confident that we are well-positioned for future success. Thank you for your continued support.","1221":"We have seen some growth in emerging markets, particularly in India and China, which is promising. [SEP] On India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade. [SEP] This is why we are continuing to invest in our operations in India and expand our reach in the region.","1222":"We have seen significant growth in our sales and revenue over the past quarter. [SEP] So to me that\u2019s what we\u2019re building to.

Our results this quarter have exceeded our expectations, and we're excited to share our progress with you. [SEP] And as far as the used cases, right now it\u2019s actually pretty diversified.

Additionally, we've had success in the logistics industry, where our platform has helped increase efficiency and reduce costs. Overall, we're pleased with the diversity of our use cases and look forward to exploring new opportunities in the future.","1224":"We're always looking for new ways to grow our business and improve the customer experience. [SEP] And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well. [SEP] As we continue to expand, we're confident that we can maintain the high level of service that our customers have come to expect.","1225":"Our revenue growth has been strong this quarter, and we have sufficient cash reserves to consider a stock buyback. However, we want to be cautious and strategic in our actions. [SEP] We want to make sure that we buy back the stock at the right time. [SEP] Our financial team is analyzing market trends and stock performance to determine the optimal timing for a buyback. We understand the importance of maximizing shareholder value and will proceed with diligence and transparency.","1226":"Our strategy moving forward is to diversify our revenue streams and expand our customer base.

[SEP] Our team has done a great job of executing on our strategic priorities, and we are well-positioned for continued growth in the coming year.","1228":"We have seen significant growth in our market share in the last quarter. [SEP] And so we will continue to push that differentiation because I think that view architecturally and the delivery of it is what makes us pretty unique. [SEP] Our team is constantly exploring new ways to innovate and improve our technology to better serve our customers.","1229":"We've had a great quarter and we're excited about the momentum we're seeing across all of our business segments. Our team has been working hard to identify areas where we can continue to grow and innovate, and we're already seeing some promising results. [SEP] Where there's significant room left \u2013 and we're not just standing still in terms of adding value for new segments, so those are all in play. [SEP] One area where we're particularly excited is in our international markets. We're seeing strong demand for our products and services in many countries where we haven't yet fully penetrated the market. Additionally, we're constantly exploring new partnerships and collaborations that will help us bring even more value to our customers. Overall, we're optimistic about the opportunities ahead and we're committed to staying ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and growth.","1230":"We're now going to discuss our strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] An importantly for our business, is connect the dots between online marketing and business outcomes. [SEP] In order to achieve this, we have invested heavily in data analytics tools that can help us determine the exact impact of our online marketing campaigns on our bottom line.","1231":"Now I want to dive into our operating expenses for the past few years. Starting with fulfillment costs... [SEP] Starting with fulfillment costs, so in the prior two years, 2016, and 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfilment and shipping by greater than 30%. [SEP] This led to increased expenses for us, but also allowed for greater efficiency in delivering products to our customers. However, in 2018, we made a conscious effort to slow down this growth and focus on optimizing our existing fulfillment centers. As a result, we saw a slight dip in square footage growth tied to fulfillment and shipping, but a significant decrease in fulfillment costs.","1232":"One of the key markets we're really excited about is India. [SEP] And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. [SEP] We've been working hard to establish a strong presence in the market, and we expect to see continued growth and success there in the coming years.","1233":"We are pleased to report strong growth in our social media platforms this quarter. [SEP] Instagram has been strong, especially with Feed Ranking and Stories. [SEP] We are continuing to invest in improving user experience on Instagram and developing new features.","1234":"One of the things we announced was that we're going to be doing a major overhaul of the News Feed algorithm and putting a lot more focus on social interaction, on content that people are interacting with. And we think that's going to be really good for the community, good for people on Facebook, and good for businesses ultimately. [SEP] But most people who come to News Feed and who come to Facebook today in general are trying figure out \u2013 they're trying to see what's going on with their friends, see what's happening in the world. [SEP] And so we're really optimistic about this change that we're making and the impact that it's going to have. We think it's going to increase engagement, increase time spent on the platform, and ultimately be better for the ecosystem overall. So we're really excited about what's coming next for Facebook and for the News Feed.","1235":"We are thrilled to report another strong quarter and record-breaking sales for our iPhone lineup. The iPhone X launch has been highly anticipated and has exceeded our expectations. [SEP] And iPhone X has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the industry, and it is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start getting it in their hands.

We are confident that the iPhone X will continue to drive growth for our company and deliver a great user experience for our customers.","1236":"We've had a strong quarter with solid revenue growth across all our business units. We've also made significant investments in optimizing our supply chain which has resulted in improved margins. [SEP] So clearly on that front, we've got a lot of projects that are going to need ongoing funding going into 2017, so that we've got good visibility on. [SEP] In addition to our ongoing projects, we will also be exploring potential partnerships and acquisitions to drive further growth and innovation. We will continue to prioritize investments that generate long-term value for our shareholders as we navigate the competitive landscape.","1237":"When it comes to our AI capabilities, we are truly at the forefront of the industry.

As we look to the future, we see huge potential for our AI solutions to transform industries and drive real-world impact at scale.","1238":"We've seen great success with our interactive video campaigns, which allow customers to engage with our product in a whole new way. [SEP] I think 360 videos in another way are another example of this kind of interactive video experience, and my guess will be that we will see more different kinds of video media as time goes on. [SEP] As technology continues to evolve, we remain committed to staying at the forefront of these new and exciting opportunities for customer engagement.","1239":"As we pivot towards the next phase of our growth strategy, we are laser-focused on enhancing the customer experience. This means investing heavily in technology, infrastructure, and talent. [SEP] because that's what is super important for us as we compete in this marketplace and more importantly double down on areas of differentiation we have. [SEP] We believe that by doing so, we can not only maintain our market position, but also capture significant market share from our competitors. Our unique value proposition, coupled with our relentless drive towards innovation, sets us apart in a crowded field.","1240":"And as we continue to invest in our infrastructure, we wanted to get an update on how our depreciation expenses are shaping up. [SEP] In general it hasn\u2019t changed a ton in terms of that final component about fixed versus I think variable base, it's still been in the I think low [40%] [ph] as a range for us in terms of what depreciation versus what's more variable. [SEP] However, we are always monitoring and evaluating our expenses to ensure we are optimizing our costs and maximizing our profitability.","1241":"As we analyze our results for the third quarter, it's important to note that we saw a divergence in demand between our consumer and commercial PC markets. [SEP] Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself. [SEP] We anticipate that this trend will continue into the next quarter, with commercial PCs driving the majority of our revenue.","1242":"In response to a question about whether a certain event had an impact on the company's earnings. [SEP] So there are these events that are obviously big like the U.S. elections, the World Cup, Super Bowl, but there are enough of these all around the world that no one event is that big for our business. [SEP] That being said, we do take into account the potential impact of these events in our forecasting and planning processes,\" the speaker added. \"But overall, our business is not so heavily reliant on any one specific event.","1243":"We have seen tremendous growth in our online sales channel over the past year. [SEP] And we expect we've got a lot of great opportunities to continue to innovate on that front. [SEP] In particular, we are exploring the use of augmented reality technology to enhance the online shopping experience for our customers.","1244":"We are constantly assessing our business and looking for areas where we can improve profitability. We have identified two areas where we believe we can increase margin. [SEP] And so we would not \u2013 in fact, we will be very aggressive in taking margin in one place, which is different as we see a path to margin in a different spot. [SEP] Our analysis shows that by reducing inventory levels and implementing more efficient logistics practices, we can increase margin in one area. In the other area, we plan to raise prices on select products to capture more value in the market. Overall, we are confident that these strategies will help us achieve our profitability goals.","1245":"We've been really focused on our marketing strategy lately. [SEP] So they were creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific actions like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer. [SEP] And we're happy to report that this campaign has seen a significant uptick in lead generation and conversion rates.","1246":"We're now going to turn our attention to our cloud business. [SEP] And so when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw in Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on where we've been discussing, for a couple of quarters now, the investments we've made in our infrastructure, the investments we've made in our supply chain, the investments we've made in scaling the business. [SEP] This continued improvement in gross margin gives us confidence in our ability to continue investing in Azure and driving growth in the future.","1247":"Thank you for that question, we have seen some concerns from investors regarding recent tariffs and trade tensions between countries. I would like to address those concerns now. [SEP] I do not view \u2013 just for avoidance of doubt here, I don't view that that issue has anything to do with the trade-related discussions between the countries. [SEP] Our company has been monitoring the trade discussions closely, and we are prepared to make any necessary adjustments to our business operations. However, I do not believe that the particular issue you mentioned is directly related to the ongoing trade negotiations between countries. We remain optimistic about the future of our industry and are committed to delivering strong results for our investors.","1248":"We're seeing some really strong growth in our online sales, particularly in the last quarter.

While we recognize the challenges of the current economic climate, we remain optimistic about the future and our ability to deliver results that exceed investor expectations. Thank you for your continued support and I'll now open up the floor for questions.","1251":"Now let's take a look at some of our other social media competitors.

[SEP] Our team is excited to continue this momentum as we move forward into the next quarter.","1252":"We've been listening to your concerns about how foreign exchange rates could impact our business, and we wanted to address that on this call. [SEP] I think my conclusion is that the guidance that we're providing for the first quarter that 39% to 40% it actually an incredible level of guidance given the foreign exchange headwinds that we're dealing with. [SEP] As a team, we've been working hard to find ways to mitigate these headwinds and maintain growth in 2021. We appreciate your continued support as we navigate these challenges.","1253":"We've been closely monitoring industry trends and assessing the needs of our customers.

[SEP] In the coming months, we'll be launching several new initiatives to capitalize on these opportunities.","1254":"We are very excited about our new product line that we are preparing to launch in the coming quarters. [SEP] We think something like gaming, hundreds of millions of people are going to want to use it, and that's great. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to ensure that the gaming experience we provide is unmatched and offers unique features that avid gamers will love.","1255":"We've received a few questions from investors regarding the impact of ad load on our business. [SEP] Just on Instagram versus Facebook and ad load, clearly the biggest driver of our business is core Facebook just in terms of sheer size and even sheer contribution to growth. [SEP] However, we've seen promising growth on Instagram as well, especially in certain markets. We're continuing to invest in both platforms and are optimistic about their potential for revenue growth in the coming years.","1256":"Our Prime membership program has been a key driver of growth for our company. [SEP] So we plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video, to two-day shipping, to same-day shipping, to Prime Now. [SEP] We are also exploring new ways to streamline the delivery process and enhance the customer experience through Prime.","1257":"As we look towards the future of our business, our team has been brainstorming ways to engage our audience with new and exciting content.

[SEP] Ultimately, our goal is to continue growing our platform and providing valuable content to our users, and we believe that trying out different approaches is key to achieving that.","1258":"We implemented some changes in our supply chain operations last quarter. [SEP] So that helps them manage our inventory better and also respond to customer inquires. [SEP] Overall, we're seeing positive results from this new approach and we plan to continue refining it moving forward.","1259":"During the quarter, we experienced notable growth in our digital advertising business. [SEP] Some of our clients approached us where they have a social budget or Facebook budget and some of that moves to Instagram and some people, it\u2019s incremental spend. [SEP] As a result, we are expanding our capabilities in social media advertising to better serve our clients' evolving needs.","1260":"Looking at our sales projections for the next quarter, we're feeling optimistic about our ability to achieve our targets. We've seen strong demand for our products in both domestic and international markets, and we've been able to capitalize on emerging trends in the industry. [SEP] And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on \u2013 with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers and quite frankly, people. [SEP] Of course, there are always factors beyond our control that could impact our results. We're closely monitoring fluctuations in the currency markets and keeping a watchful eye on any potential supply chain disruptions. However, our team is committed to adapting quickly to any challenges that arise and remaining agile in our approach.","1261":"As we wrap up another successful quarter, I wanted to take some time to speak on our continued growth and success.

[SEP] We are also investing in new technologies to improve targeting and personalization, which will further enhance the relevance of our ads.","1263":"We have identified a new growth opportunity in the market. [SEP] That\u2019s going to be a big area of investment for us. [SEP] We have allocated additional resources to accelerate the development of this area.","1264":"One of the key strategies for growth in the coming year is expanding our new product line into new markets. [SEP] We'll continue doing that in more places, but the U.S. was certainly one of the biggest places that we were focused on launching it. [SEP] With the success we have seen in the U.S., we are confident that we can replicate that success in other regions.","1265":"Looking back on the past quarter, we are pleased with the progress we made towards our goals.

We believe this will drive greater loyalty and help us to expand our user base in new and exciting ways. Thank you for joining us on this call.","1269":"During the first quarter of the year, we made a significant change in our accounting policies. [SEP] It was - for Q1, the impact of a change was a decrease of about $130 million to cost of sales due to the capitalization change. [SEP] However, despite this change, our profit margins remained stable and we were able to achieve our revenue targets for the quarter.","1270":"We received a lot of questions about our inventory levels during the last quarter. [SEP] You know that in general, we decrease our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. [SEP] This year, we noticed a larger decrease in inventory than we had planned for due to stronger-than-expected sales.","1271":"Our mobile app has been a key driver of our revenue growth in the past quarter. [SEP] And part of it is that there's of course a bigger opportunity when people have their phones with them all the time, but I think that there are plenty of other worlds that we could be living in where we wouldn't have necessarily executed on that opportunity. [SEP] Our team has worked tirelessly to optimize the user experience on our mobile app, and I believe this has contributed significantly to our success.","1272":"Our team is thrilled to report another quarter of strong growth and success. [SEP] So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores.

Thank you to all of our customers for your continued support.","1274":"In terms of our share repurchase strategy, we have been evaluating it carefully over the past few months. [SEP] We look at it on two fronts: just offsetting the dilution from the share issuances that we have and then secondarily, to be opportunistic. [SEP] Our goal is always to maximize shareholder value, so we will continue to monitor market conditions and pursue opportunities that make sense for us.","1275":"Our overall earnings for this quarter are lower than expected due to increased operating expenses. However, we are still seeing growth in our sales revenue. [SEP] So that piece of depreciation doesn't change per se. [SEP] As we look to the future, we anticipate further investment in technology infrastructure, including upgrading our servers and software. This will result in additional depreciation costs, but we believe it is necessary for our long-term success.","1276":"We are excited to share that our targeting tools have been performing exceptionally well.

[SEP] And based on our recent data, we've seen a significant increase in click-through rates and overall engagement with our targeted ads.","1278":"We have experienced slow sales in the last quarter due to reasons beyond our control. [SEP] That\u2019s not unusual prior to a launch cycle and that will clearly impact our revenue in the quarter. [SEP] However, we are confident that the launch cycle will lead to a significant increase in revenue for the next quarter.","1279":"Now let's take a closer look at our Q4 financial results. [SEP] We did see headcount growth come down modestly in Q4 from Q3 to 42%. [SEP] However, overall headcount growth for the year was still strong at 50%.","1280":"Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, which is up 102% year-over-year. I want to take a moment to break down a portion of that revenue that has been a topic of discussion - the $560 million in new revenue. [SEP] As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised \u2013 or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%. [SEP] While this new revenue is significant, it's important to note that it came from a variety of sources, including new partnerships and acquisitions. Overall, we are pleased with the growth we've seen in our core business and the potential for continued expansion in the coming quarters. Thank you for your time today, and we look forward to updating you again soon.","1281":"Our Q2 results are impressive across all metrics.

[SEP] Our partnerships with third-party developers have also shown strong growth in Q2.","1282":"We've been exploring different ways to engage with our customers and provide them with the best user experience possible. One area that we've been particularly focused on is messaging services. [SEP] It feels \u2013 when you're using a messaging service, that everything there is very intimate and private so it feels like a more natural space to be interacting with a business in a private way for doing transactions. [SEP] We've seen a great response from our customers who appreciate the convenience and privacy of messaging-based transactions. As a result, we'll be working to further integrate this feature into our overall customer engagement strategy.","1283":"We've been able to continuously exceed our financial targets and expectations.

Our team on the ground has done an exceptional job of navigating the complexities of the market and building strong relationships with key stakeholders.

And as always, we welcome feedback from our customers to help us refine and improve our offerings.","1290":"Now let's talk about our fulfillment capacity. It's been a big focus for us this year and we're excited to share some progress on that front. [SEP] In the quarter, in Q3 we added 18 fulfillment centers and we've added five more in October. [SEP] With these new centers, we are able to offer faster delivery times to our customers and improve our overall efficiency. We also have plans to continue expanding our fulfillment network in the coming months to keep up with growing demand.","1291":"During the past quarter, we continued to invest in new features and technologies to enhance the user experience on our platform.

[SEP] Despite any potential market volatility surrounding elections, we remain confident in our ability to continue driving growth and delivering value to our shareholders.","1293":"We've seen some fluctuation in our feed pricing over the past year, which I know has been an area of concern for investors. [SEP] But I think in terms of it converging on feed from any pricing perspective, that's a journey that's going to take years, not quarters. [SEP] However, we are committed to making progress and taking steps to bring our feed pricing in line with the market. We have a dedicated team working on this initiative and will continue to update our stakeholders on our progress.","1294":"We've been focusing on expanding our offerings for the Internet of Things market.

[SEP] But, more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it is, we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever, we've got new products on the way, the pipeline is full of great new stuff both on the product and the services side. [SEP] And of course, our strong partnerships with key players in the industry only improve our ability to reach new customers and expand our market share.","1297":"We have been pleased to see continued growth and expansion in our partnership network. [SEP] Partners are adding new routes. [SEP] These new routes are helping to drive increased traffic and revenue.","1298":"We have identified two key areas for growth in the upcoming quarter.

[SEP] Overall, we did see Europe had a reacceleration of growth in Q2 versus Q1. [SEP] This was primarily driven by a rebound in Germany, our largest market in the region.

[SEP] And I would say, I start with renewals, not just that we renew the contract but how many new products, new services did we add to that contract? [SEP] Additionally, we prioritize cross-selling and upselling opportunities with our current clients to drive additional revenue streams. We've seen a significant increase in revenue from these efforts and plan to continue this focus going forward. Overall, our renewal rate and contract expansion metrics are promising indicators of a strong foundation for future growth.","1348":"In response to feedback from our customers, we've been reevaluating our approach to measuring engagement on our platform. [SEP] So now we're going to shift that that methodology a little bit to instead of just being focused on the content, now to be more focused on trying to measure and have people tell us what is creating the most meaningful interaction in their lives. [SEP] We believe that this shift will allow us to better understand and meet the needs of our users, ultimately driving increased usage and revenue growth for the company.","1349":"We saw incredible success on our annual Prime Day event last month. [SEP] It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike. [SEP] Our technology and operational capabilities continue to improve, allowing us to better serve customers and meet demand during these peak events. We are already looking forward to next year's Prime Day.","1350":"Thank you for your question about our plans for expansion into the enterprise market. [SEP] I've seen enterprise solutions. [SEP] And I must say, I've been thoroughly impressed by the powerful enterprise solutions I've seen recently.","1351":"Now let's move on to our plans for improving user engagement on our platform. [SEP] And for video search \u2013 search is a big priority and a thing that we're working on across all of the different verticals, not just video but also all the posts on Facebook, all of the content that people are selling in Marketplace, the groups that people are joining and sharing and all the news content. [SEP] We believe that optimizing search functionality can greatly enhance the user experience and make Facebook a more valuable tool for our advertisers.","1352":"Moving on to our regional performance, let's start with international markets. [SEP] And then rest-of-world, we saw a rebound in Latin America, especially Brazil, so we're seeing some particular strength there. [SEP] Despite some challenges in Asia, overall we're pleased with the growth we're seeing outside of our domestic market.","1353":"Our strategy for the first half of the year has been to focus on improving our backend systems and optimizing our supply chain. [SEP] We're obviously expecting faster growth in the back half \u2013 back three quarters of the year, so that's \u2013 video's going to be a component in driving that. [SEP] Additionally, we are investing in new product development and marketing initiatives that we expect will further drive revenue growth in the coming quarters.","1354":"Thank you for joining us today. I'll begin by providing some updates on our recent performance. Overall, we're very pleased with how the holiday season went and the momentum we're seeing across our business. [SEP] As part of the holiday offering, we sold a number of record breaking number of Alexa devices as well and I think just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members, we had the most ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. [SEP] Additionally, we saw strong growth in our advertising business, with revenues increasing by 30%. This was driven by increased demand for sponsored products and higher click-through rates. Looking ahead, we remain focused on investing in our core offerings, expanding our global footprint, and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. Thank you again for joining us today.","1355":"Our Q3 earnings report shows a strong increase in revenue from our advertising business. [SEP] So rather than go to every advertiser both through our sales force and through our online tools where we sell and say we have a new format, you need to create the new format, you need to figure out the placement being able to just take what they are already doing like Feed ads, converted into Stories and place at anywhere helps us move people into these formats. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and improve our advertising offerings, we expect to see continued growth in this area.","1356":"Can you expand on the capabilities of your database solution? [SEP] It's a database that's on-premise that can be tiered with the cloud. [SEP] How does this offering stack up against competitors in the market?\" \n\n\"It's a unique offering that allows our customers to have the flexibility of both on-premise and cloud-based data storage. We understand that some organizations may have concerns about moving all of their data to the cloud, and this solution provides a seamless transition for them. Additionally, it offers the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the cloud when needed. We believe this sets us apart from other database solutions on the market and gives us a competitive advantage.","1357":"We've seen a lot of growth in our international markets lately. Can you speak to your outlook for these regions? [SEP] I think it will take longer for the GDP to rival it, but that's not critical for us to have a great success there. [SEP] Our focus moving forward will be on maximizing our reach in these markets and continuing to deliver exceptional value to our customers.","1358":"Can you provide some examples of how your company is adapting to the current market conditions? [SEP] Generically, each of the examples was quite different. [SEP] However, we have identified certain strategies that have been successful across the board and are working to implement them company-wide.","1359":"As we look ahead to the first quarter of this year, we do expect to face some challenges. [SEP] It's -- given the 30% plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's 1 major headwind from Q4 to Q1. [SEP] However, we are confident that our team is well equipped to manage these obstacles and continue delivering results for our shareholders.","1360":"We are pleased to announce the financial results for the third quarter of this fiscal year. [SEP] The enterprise business is clearly picking up and more and more companies are either contracting for or writing apps themselves. [SEP] As a result, the enterprise division has seen a significant increase in revenue compared to the same period last year.","1361":"As we continue to expand our services and grow our customer base, we are focused on ensuring that our infrastructure can support our increasing demand. [SEP] We've got a lot of infrastructure investment that we're making across data centers, servers, network. [SEP] This investment will not only enhance the performance and reliability of our services but also provide future opportunities for innovation and growth.","1362":"Regarding our staffing plans for our fulfillment centers, I wanted to share an update with everyone on the call. We have some aggressive goals for this year in terms of expanding our workforce. [SEP] I think we put out a release, I think, earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. [SEP] We've already made significant progress towards our goal, with over 30,000 operations employees brought on board in the first half of the year. We're on track to meet our target of 120,000 new hires by the end of 2021, which will enable us to continue scaling up our operations and improving our delivery times for customers.","1363":"We are committed to enhancing our market position and growing revenue through strategic initiatives. [SEP] We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. [SEP] Our focus on building our intra-network capabilities will enable us to deliver better service and value to our customers.","1364":"Our next question comes from the line of John from Morgan Stanley. [SEP] I think we've made some strong changes on Facebook in terms of meaningful social interactions, and I think the history of our ability to develop and iterate on consumer products shows that we can help people as they evolve, share the things they want to share, and have a very meaningful and important experience in feed as they're sharing. [SEP] And with the ongoing improvements we're making, I am confident that we will continue to build on this momentum and provide even more meaningful experiences for our users.","1365":"Thank you for joining us today for our earnings conference call. I would like to now discuss our financial performance for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. [SEP] We are pleased with our Q4 results. [SEP] We saw growth in revenue and profitability due to the launch of several new products and strategic partnerships. We look forward to continuing this positive momentum into the next fiscal year. Thank you for your continued support.","1366":"We're very excited about the future of virtual reality, and we believe it has the potential to change the way people consume entertainment. It's still early days for VR, but we're investing heavily in the technology to ensure that we can offer our customers the best possible experience. [SEP] There are around, I think, more than 200 million, almost 250 million people who have either an Xbox, a PlayStation or a Wii, and we think that that audience is going to the type of people who are going to be very excited about the type of experiences initially that you can have with virtual reality. [SEP] Of course, there are challenges that come with developing VR content, and we're working hard to overcome those. For example, we need to create experiences that are immersive and engaging, but also easy to navigate and not too overwhelming for users. We're confident that we can overcome these challenges, and we're excited to see what the future holds for VR and our business.","1367":"During the last quarter, we saw a strong growth in our revenue. [SEP] We will of course continue to do that where it makes sense and where opportunity presents itself. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new markets and evaluating potential acquisitions to expand our business.","1368":"Our team has been working diligently to capitalize on the growing e-commerce industry and to continue expanding our reach. We are committed to providing the best possible experience for our customers and our shareholders. [SEP] So I think you should think about it that way that certainly think its big opportunity and again, one of the reasons I want to give you an update, last quarter on Prime growth and you can see that that\u2019s going very well. [SEP] Additionally, we are excited to announce our plans for further international expansion, which we believe will contribute to our continued growth. We are confident that our investments in technology and infrastructure will continue to strengthen our position in the market and drive future success.","1369":"One of the questions we get a lot is how we think about balancing investment opportunities versus our ongoing operations. [SEP] And so, again, we're juggling the investment in the places where we feel like we have long-term opportunities where we need to invest with making sure we're getting continuously better in all our other processes at the same time. [SEP] It's a delicate balance, but we feel like we've made good progress in both areas over the past few quarters.","1370":"Our platform is really unique in the sense that we offer a wide variety of tools and functionalities. [SEP] We also make a lot of things that they couldn't do in other platforms available on us. [SEP] This has given us a significant competitive advantage, and we have seen a lot of interest from customers who value this flexibility and customization.","1371":"I'd like to take a moment to discuss our strategy for supporting small and medium-sized businesses.\"\n\n\"Another area we've identified for growth is the SMB market. [SEP] We're also very focused on helping SMBs have a presence, especially a mobile presence. [SEP] To that end, we've invested significantly in our mobile app development resources.\"\n\n\"We believe that by offering affordable and user-friendly mobile solutions, we can empower these businesses to compete effectively in the digital landscape.","1372":"As you know, our platform relies heavily on the success of our sellers. [SEP] So we have a vested interest in the success of our sellers. [SEP] That's why we are constantly working to improve our tools and services, and offering educational resources to help them grow their businesses.","1373":"Now let's turn our attention to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] As you know, foreign exchange has been a very significant headwind over the last three-plus years, but we've been able to manage that. [SEP] We are continuing to monitor the currency fluctuations closely and have implemented strategies to minimize its impact on our business moving forward.","1374":"Our team has been focused on improving the user experience for our customers. [SEP] But it was hard to do in the previous generation because of the server infrastructure and what I would say sophistication of IT required. [SEP] However, with advancements in cloud computing and automation, we have been able to streamline our processes and scale much more efficiently.","1375":"Can you give us more detail on your company's focus on e-commerce? [SEP] Sure well, I mean we do a lot of stuff around commerce. [SEP] Do you see any particular challenges or opportunities in this area for the upcoming quarter?","1376":"We have received a lot of questions about our performance metrics for our different business units. [SEP] So I don't really think it\u2019s about a percentage, but it\u2019s about each of them continuing to make progress. [SEP] Our focus is on achieving sustainable growth and improvement, and we believe that each unit has its own unique challenges and opportunities that require individualized attention.","1377":"Our strategy is to expand our platform's content offerings to compete with our rivals. [SEP] We're looking at a wide range of content, and we're really working towards a revenue share model with creators. [SEP] We believe this revenue share model will incentivize creators to produce high-quality content and foster a mutually beneficial relationship.","1378":"We are pleased to report a strong quarter, with revenue growth exceeding our expectations. Our team has worked hard to execute on our strategic initiatives, and the results speak for themselves. However, as we look to the future, there are certain challenges that we must address. [SEP] But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. [SEP] As we continue to expand our operations, we need to ensure that our leaders have the capacity to support these efforts. That means recruiting and retaining talented individuals who can help us achieve our goals. We also need to make sure that our existing staff isn't overburdened, as this can lead to burnout and turnover. Ultimately, our success will depend on both our financial performance and our ability to manage our resources effectively.","1379":"We have been exploring ways to increase our customer base and drive sales. One of the strategies we implemented this quarter was partnering with Amazon. [SEP] The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. [SEP] These initiatives have proven to be successful as we have seen an increase in online sales and customer satisfaction. We will continue to evaluate new opportunities for growth and expansion in the coming quarters.","1380":"One area of focus for our operations team is improving our inventory management. We've noticed some delays in getting products into our warehouse and we're looking for ways to streamline this process. [SEP] We're also trying to incentivize getting inventory into the warehouse quicker. [SEP] To encourage faster turnaround times, we're offering bonuses to our suppliers who can deliver their products ahead of schedule. In addition, we're implementing new technology that will allow us to track inventory in real-time and identify any bottlenecks in the process.","1381":"We've seen a lot of positive momentum in our sales and customer acquisition over the past few months. [SEP] And so we're very confident that this quarter is going to be great. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to deliver top-notch products and services to our customers, and we're seeing the results pay off.","1382":"I'd now like to discuss our expansion plans for the upcoming year. [SEP] We're uniquely positioned to do this given our retail business. [SEP] Through our retail business, we have access to extensive customer data and insights that will allow us to better understand and serve our online customers.","1383":"Our top priority is to ensure that we maintain excellent customer service. [SEP] We\u2019re continuing to invest heavily in the business. [SEP] This investment includes expanding our workforce, improving our technology, and exploring new markets.","1384":"During the past quarter, we continued to expand our presence in China, which remains a key market for our business. Our strategy of targeting the country's burgeoning middle class and rapidly growing digital landscape has enabled us to achieve strong revenue growth in the region. [SEP] And, launching the Hong Kong region gets us to a footprint of 19 cities in China. [SEP] Looking ahead, we plan to further expand our operations in China, as we believe there is still significant untapped potential in this market. In addition to launching in Hong Kong, we are exploring opportunities to enter new cities and introduce new products and services that will appeal to Chinese consumers. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to drive continued growth and success in this important region.","1385":"Our new pricing strategy has allowed us to unbundle our products and services so that customers have more flexibility in purchasing what they need. We believe that this will lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. [SEP] If you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases even a 7, you may have paid $199 for \u2013 and now in an unbundled world it's obviously much more than that. [SEP] However, we understand that this may not be as affordable for some of our long-time customers who have been with us for several years. We are looking at ways to offer discounts or incentives to those who upgrade to our latest products, and we appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate this new pricing landscape together.","1386":"Our focus on delivering gaming experiences has resulted in strong growth for our gaming division. [SEP] And we now have a business model with Game Pass as well as all the supporting mechanisms for Game Pass like game streaming, we\u2019ve a social network in Xbox Live that is the best in the business. [SEP] This has also allowed us to attract and retain a large and loyal user base, as well as attract new gamers to our ecosystem.","1387":"We've been closely monitoring the changes in data privacy regulations, and have made some updates to our product offerings to adhere to these new guidelines. [SEP] I think what we think is that depending on how people react to the controls and the ad settings, there could be some limitations to data usage. [SEP] That being said, we're still committed to providing advertisers with valuable insights into their target audiences. We'll continue to explore new ways to collect and analyze data that both prioritize consumer privacy and meet our clients' needs.","1388":"We've been closely analyzing our customer acquisition strategy and identifying areas where we can improve. [SEP] In certain geographies, the way that we win is to get switchers. [SEP] We're seeing significant success in these areas and are confident that we can continue to grow our customer base through this approach.","1389":"The company was recently criticized for not addressing social issues in their products. [SEP] A few years ago, we probably would\u2019ve rolled this out and tried to deal with issues as they came up with, but now part of our new approach of trying to be more proactive about social issues is trying to build in from the ground up, getting this right upfront. [SEP] This new approach has led to better feedback from customers and a more positive reputation for the company.","1390":"Our company has been investing in original content for our streaming platform. [SEP] Mozart in the Jungle just won two Golden Globe Awards. [SEP] We believe this award-winning show will attract even more subscribers to our service.","1391":"We have seen a significant increase in online orders in the past quarter. [SEP] We like the convenience factor. [SEP] Our focus on improving our app and website has resulted in a seamless online ordering experience for our customers.","1392":"Our focus on innovation and growth has led us to explore new partnerships and opportunities. [SEP] And so we've made a number of product and performance investments there with Facebook like being a good example of that. [SEP] As a result, we have seen significant improvements in user engagement and revenue growth.","1393":"Investor: \"Can you please share your plans for expanding into the gaming industry?\" \n\nCEO: \"I appreciate the question, but it's important to note that our company's mission is primarily focused on the telecommunications sector. [SEP] It's not the mission of the company. [SEP] We do believe in exploring new opportunities and diversifying our portfolio, but any expansion will be evaluated based on its alignment with our core values and mission. Our priority is to continue delivering high-quality service to our customers and drive growth in our existing markets.","1394":"Thank you for your question. Our ad revenue growth in the last quarter was quite strong, driven by a number of factors. [SEP] but I would just say that this is primarily driven by News Feed pricing, and then you have right-hand-column pricing as well, so you have impressions on Facebook News Feed, Instagram feed, as well as Facebook right-hand column. [SEP] Overall, we're continuing to see strong demand for our ad offerings, and we're optimistic about our ability to continue growing our revenue going forward. Of course, there are always potential challenges and risks to be aware of, but we believe we're well-positioned to navigate them successfully.","1395":"Our focus this quarter has been on improving the resilience and reliability of our server management software. [SEP] We also have built now into windows server backup and disaster recovery, same thing with SQL server. [SEP] We've received positive feedback from customers who have already utilized these features in their backup and disaster recovery protocols.","1396":"During the quarter, our detection systems flagged a record number of suspicious activities, helping us to prevent potential fraud and protect our customers. We continue to invest heavily in new technologies and algorithms that improve our ability to identify fraudulent behavior. [SEP] There are going to be things that our systems miss, no matter how well-tuned we are. [SEP] However, we are aware that fraudsters are constantly evolving their tactics, and we must remain vigilant to stay ahead of them. We encourage our customers to also take steps to protect themselves, such as using strong, unique passwords and regularly monitoring their accounts for any unusual activity.","1397":"I'd like to address some concerns about safety and how we're working to make our platform a safer space for all users. [SEP] So on safety, I think given the volume of content that people share, if you want to have any hope of doing it in real time, the only hope is building AI systems that can either identify things and handle them proactively or at the very least, flag them for a lot of people who work for us who can then look at them rather than waiting for people in our community to flag those after they've already seen them. [SEP] We've invested heavily in developing and training our AI systems to better detect and prevent harmful content from being shared on our platform.","1398":"So with that said, we have made progress in terms of streamlining our operations and increasing efficiency. However, there's still more work to be done in certain areas. [SEP] But at this point, we're still working on that and kind of getting it up to speed. [SEP] We anticipate that once we have everything running smoothly, we'll start to see significant cost savings and improved overall performance. In the meantime, we appreciate our team's hard work and patience as we continue to fine-tune our processes.","1399":"We have been seeing a significant uptick in cyber attacks across various industries in recent months. As these attacks become more sophisticated, businesses are realizing the importance of investing in newer and better security technologies. [SEP] When that happens, it does create demand for new devices and modern devices that improved security. [SEP] In response to this demand, we have dedicated a portion of our R&D team to developing cutting-edge security features for our devices. We are confident that our latest product line will provide our customers with the highest level of security available in the market today.","1400":"We have recently been experiencing some challenges with our digital advertising revenue. [SEP] I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. [SEP] However, we are confident that our upcoming fall lineup will attract a significant viewership and generate strong ad revenue.","1401":"One area of our business that we have invested heavily in over the past year is artificial intelligence. [SEP] But what we've actually also found is that through some of our AI research, we can look at the responses that businesses give to common questions and can confidently provide the right reply a lot of the time. [SEP] We believe that continuing to develop and leverage our AI capabilities will be a key driver of growth and success in the years to come.","1402":"We're now going to move on to our expense guidance for the upcoming year. [SEP] So that compensation expense base that we're bringing into 2019 is really factoring into the overall growth guidance for the total expense guide, so that's a big factor there. [SEP] However, we're confident in our ability to manage these expenses and maintain our strong financial position moving forward.","1403":"During the past quarter, we continued to invest in our cloud and IoT businesses, which drove strong revenue growth. We also saw solid demand for our Surface devices, and we continue to make inroads into the education market with our affordable Windows devices. [SEP] And if you think about when we say Windows-as-a-service it\u2019s actually a pretty profound construct which involves us being able to not only think about what ships with OEMs, but how do we on a continuous basis, if it\u2019s a consumer we have things now in the store, we have subscriptions, we have gaming and then when it comes to the enterprise there\u2019s management, security, servicing which is all unique value. [SEP] As part of our commitment to Windows-as-a-service, we're constantly exploring new ways to provide value to our customers. For example, we recently introduced new features for Windows 10 that improve productivity and make it easier for businesses to manage their devices. Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions that meet our customers' needs and drive long-term growth for the company.","1404":"Our earnings for the quarter were impacted by a significant legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. As a result, we had to make a $5 billion accrual for potential fines and penalties. [SEP] Even if you were to set aside the $5 billion FTC accrual. [SEP] However, even if you were to set aside the $5 billion FTC accrual, our profits for the quarter still exceeded analyst expectations. We remain confident in the strength of our business and are optimistic about our future growth prospects.","1405":"Our sales team has been working hard to negotiate with our clients in terms of pricing. [SEP] And there\u2019s definitely some pricing action we were able to take [SEP] However, we are closely monitoring the market trends and will adjust our pricing strategies accordingly.","1406":"We've been monitoring our new product launch closely and have some early data to share with you all. [SEP] The early trends are good, but I think this is really going to be an area that is proportional to the amount of quality content that is in the system, and the business model is really going to be the thing that enables that. [SEP] We're confident that with our strong content strategy and business model, we'll continue to see positive growth in this area.","1407":"We are really pleased with our performance this quarter and are excited about the momentum we are seeing across the business. [SEP] I would just say that, our growth is coming from customers that span from start-ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us, and many of them have gone \u2013 a large number have gone all-in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result. [SEP] We remain focused on providing our customers with the most innovative and reliable cloud services in the market, and we will continue to invest in our platform to drive even more growth in the future.","1408":"Our new marketing strategy has really paid off, with a significant increase in website traffic and sales. [SEP] And that was a big moment for us, I think, in the auto vertical. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and expand our offerings, we believe we can maintain this momentum in the auto industry.","1409":"In response to our commitment to supporting micro and small businesses in India, we have recently made a major announcement. [SEP] We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India. [SEP] We believe that these investments will be essential to supporting the long-term digitization of India's economy and helping to build a more sustainable future for all.","1410":"We have identified three key areas that we will focus on in the next quarter. [SEP] The third one is operational efficiency. [SEP] By improving our operational efficiency, we believe we can significantly reduce our costs and increase our profitability.","1411":"During this quarter, we have seen significant growth in our digital advertising business. We have been investing in our technology to enhance our advertising capabilities and have seen positive results. [SEP] So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and chip with Amazon programs. [SEP] Additionally, we plan to expand our advertising offerings to new markets and geographies. We are confident that our investments in our advertising technology will help us capture greater market share and drive long-term growth for our business.","1412":"Our Q3 results have been impressive and we are proud of our team's hard work. [SEP] So I think what you're seeing in terms of year over year and what does it mean for next year, this next quarter, it will be a sequential increase, but again, it is a bit lumpy. [SEP] However, we anticipate some challenges in Q4 due to the uncertainty in the market.","1413":"Can you provide an update on the progress of your expansion plans? [SEP] So I remain optimistic that we'll be able to do work there, but we're just working across a lot of different fronts here because this is a huge space. [SEP] We appreciate your efforts to navigate this complex market and look forward to hearing more in the coming months.","1414":"I'd like to now discuss our expenses for the quarter. [SEP] In addition, growth in infrastructure spend is our large increase in CapEx over the last several years, flows through the income statement as another driver of our expense growth as well. [SEP] However, we believe that this investment in our infrastructure will position us for even greater success in the future.\" \n\nIn addition, growth in infrastructure spend is our large increase in CapEx over the last several years, flows through the income statement as another driver of our expense growth as well. We have been strategically increasing our investments in infrastructure to support our growing business and to improve our overall customer experience. This has included investments in areas such as data centers, network capacity, and cybersecurity measures. As a result, we have seen significant improvements in our operational efficiency and a reduction in customer service issues. We are confident that our continued investment in infrastructure will enable us to remain competitive and meet the evolving needs of our customers in the years to come.","1415":"We're seeing good progress in our research and development efforts. [SEP] And if you want to accelerate development, obviously, we need to get our products in the market at a good pace. [SEP] That being said, we need to ensure quality control and regulatory compliance are met before launching our products.","1416":"We need to address both revenue growth and cost reduction in order to achieve our financial goals for the year. These goals are critical for us to maintain our competitiveness in the market. [SEP] They're inextricably linked. [SEP] We believe that by investing in R&D and streamlining our operations, we can achieve both of these objectives simultaneously. This will require a significant amount of effort on our part, but we are confident in our ability to meet the challenge.","1417":"Our international expansion has been a key focus for us over the past year. We have been working diligently to make our offerings accessible to customers all over the world. And we are happy to report that our efforts are paying off. [SEP] We like the adoption of Prime internationally. [SEP] We have seen significant growth in our international Prime membership program, which includes free shipping and exclusive content. In fact, Prime adoption has more than doubled in some regions. This is a strong indication that customers appreciate the convenience, speed, and additional benefits of being a Prime member. As we continue to expand our reach and invest in new technologies, we believe we can further increase our global Prime membership base.","1418":"Our current focus on the domestic market has served us well and has helped us achieve strong financial results. However, as we look to the future, we recognize the need to expand our reach. [SEP] We see that being more balanced over time and being more global as we move forward. [SEP] To this end, we have already started exploring opportunities in international markets and are actively working on establishing partnerships and collaborations. We believe that this shift towards a more global approach will not only increase our revenue streams but also help us diversify our portfolio and mitigate risks.","1419":"We are seeing strong growth in our Watch product, which has become an important part of our overall strategy. In the last quarter, we added several new features to Watch, including the ability to save and share videos. [SEP] And the big thing that unlocked a lot of growth in Watch is we basically were able to move a bunch of the video-watching behavior to a different tab, where people intentionally go to the tab [SEP] sentences: We are continuing to invest in Watch and believe there is significant potential for growth in the coming years.

[SEP] And we've got some iPhones that are really great for that market. [SEP] Our sales team has been working hard to expand our distribution channels in those regions.","1422":"We've received feedback from our users and advertisers that the content on our platform is not always relevant or high quality. This has led to lower engagement and less successful advertising campaigns. [SEP] And our response has been that we're going to focus on improving the quality and relevance and that's both going to perform better for the people using our services and businesses who are buying ads. [SEP] We're investing resources into better algorithms and content moderation to ensure that only the most informative and valuable content is displayed on our platform.

[SEP] The sort of the economic question which I know there's a bit lot of attention on, frankly, if I were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look how many customers are coming in our stores regardless to whether they're buying, how many people are coming online, and in addition looking at our sales trend, I wouldn't know if there was any economic issue at all in China.

The future is bright and we are excited to continue learning and growing as a company.","1429":"One of the challenges we faced this quarter was driving customer engagement through mobile platforms.

[SEP] However, we have identified some cost-effective strategies to increase our mobile app downloads and engagement, such as partnering with social media influencers.","1430":"Now let's take a look at our e-commerce performance for the year. [SEP] Our Amazon Fulfilled units, the amount going through our fulfillment centers and which essentially includes our first-party retail and our FBA sales and it grew nearly 40% over 2016.

[SEP] And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might. [SEP] However, these shareholders have been steadfast and supportive of our company for years, and we value their continued investment in our success. Nonetheless, we are actively exploring ways to diversify our shareholder base and attract new investors who share our vision for the future of this company.","1434":"Now I want to highlight a specific international market that has shown significant growth in the past quarter.

[SEP] I think it's a good experience inside Facebook, but we also have had examples over time, like Messenger for example, where we started it in Facebook and decided that in order to fulfill their potential, it needed to be its own experience over time. [SEP] So, while we are always looking for ways to enhance the user experience within Facebook, we also recognize that some products may need to stand on their own in order to truly thrive.","1437":"We're constantly evaluating new technologies to see how we can incorporate them into our business. [SEP] Same thing with AI, not an old workload.

We're excited to share some of the upcoming projects we've been working on.

[SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize the well-being and safety of our employees while also focusing on driving growth and innovation within our industry.","1446":"One of the challenges we faced this quarter was dealing with a legal dispute. [SEP] I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. [SEP] However, we were able to come to a settlement through mediation rather than going to trial.","1447":"We have been investing heavily in research and development to stay ahead of the curve. [SEP] In fact if you look at our innovation, we're perhaps unique in the large screen innovation that we're doing with Surface Hub, Hollow Lands as well as some of the two-in-one form factors.

Additionally, we are committed to expanding our product lineup to meet the evolving needs of our customers and the market as a whole.","1448":"We've identified the UK as a key market for our company's expansion efforts.

[SEP] First of all on the -- there were two items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1.

[SEP] And we\u2019re doing all we can to make it very easy to adopt the format. [SEP] We've already received positive feedback from beta testers who have found the new format much more user-friendly.","1454":"We've been seeing a lot of growth in both WhatsApp and Messenger. People continue to rely on these messaging services to stay connected with their friends and family, especially during these times of social distancing. [SEP] And then there are differences in the feature sets where WhatsApp is extremely utilitarian and focused on texting and now voice calling, whereas Messenger is very focused on expression and the whole set of things that fit into the tools around the Messenger platform that we rolled out at F8, communicating with businesses now, richer tools to communicate in different ways.

[SEP] Our team has been working hard to integrate these technologies into our products and services to better meet the needs of our customers.","1464":"We are seeing a significant shift in the market towards cloud-based solutions. [SEP] But at the same time, we still will focus on those deals moving to the cloud over time. [SEP] Our strategy is to continue investing in cloud technology and services to meet this demand.","1465":"Our revenue for the quarter exceeded expectations, showing a growth of 12% year over year. This was due to strong demand for our cloud-based services and a continued shift towards subscriptions. [SEP] because if you think about the $1 billion plus beat we had for the unearned, it was due to the fact that we had very good mix shift Office 365 in terms of billings in the quarter, almost very little of that gets recognized in quarter. [SEP] We are confident that the momentum will continue into the next quarter. We expect even stronger growth in our cloud offerings and continued adoption of our Office 365 subscription service.

[SEP] Also the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1, and what we saw was a pre-buy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter, and based on our history with the last time the consumption tax went up many years ago, we\u2019ve expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to navigate this challenge and continue delivering value to our customers in Japan.","1468":"Thank you for joining us today for our earnings conference call. We are excited to report strong growth in our services division and continued momentum across all of our lines of business. As we navigate the current market environment, we remain focused on delivering value to our customers while driving innovation and growth. [SEP] And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but that\u2019s why I tend to not focus at that layer it\u2019s like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time you\u2019d expect a higher mix of premium versus core. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to sustain this momentum and capture new opportunities in the market. We are actively investing in our digital capabilities, expanding our product offerings, and deepening our relationships with key partners and stakeholders. With our strong balance sheet, diverse revenue streams, and talented team, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Thank you again for your time and support.","1469":"We've been getting a lot of questions about our decision to introduce new reaction buttons on the platform. I just want to take a moment to explain our thinking behind this. [SEP] But the philosophy behind it is that when you only have a like button, if you share a sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it. [SEP] That's why we decided to introduce a range of emotions people can use to react to posts. You'll now be able to express a wider range of emotions, allowing for more meaningful interactions on the platform. We're really excited to see how people use these new features and what impact they'll have on the community.","1470":"We recognize that this transition to the cloud is a significant undertaking, but we are fully committed to it.

[SEP] With this success, we will continue to invest in new product categories and take risks that will set us apart from our competitors.","1475":"We have noticed a significant increase in our overall ad spend in the past quarter. [SEP] The video ad spend is not all incremental of course [SEP] However, we have determined that a portion of the increase in video ad spend is cannibalizing our display ad revenue.","1476":"Our advertising revenue has been slightly down this quarter. [SEP] We're competing with other forms of media. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our ability to capture a larger audience share in the coming year.","1477":"Now, let me turn to our social media strategy. [SEP] And Stories on Facebook, clearly, Stories is a big success on Instagram. [SEP] And we're seeing the growth continue as we roll out Stories to Facebook and other platforms.","1478":"Our ecommerce business has seen tremendous growth in the past year. [SEP] We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and One-Day options. [SEP] As a result, we've seen a significant increase in customer satisfaction and loyalty.","1479":"Moving on to our iPhone sales performance, we are pleased to report that the demand remained strong despite the ongoing pandemic. [SEP] This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year and that is true in total and it's true for Greater China as well. [SEP] As we continue to focus on managing our channel inventory efficiently, we expect to see the benefits of our efforts reflected in our financial performance in the upcoming quarters.","1480":"We have invested heavily in improving our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. This has allowed us to enhance the user experience and provide more relevant content to our users. [SEP] So for example, that means being able to read and understand news articles or posts that people make or messages that a person might send to a business so we can help that business auto-reply to them and get information back to the person really quickly, or understand the content so we can better understand what might be interesting to a person and show it in News Feed.

I'm pleased to report that our company has made significant progress in achieving our financial goals this quarter. We've also been hard at work improving our customer engagement strategies.

Our strategy is centered on innovation and creating technologies that make a difference in people's lives.

As you can see from the numbers, we have experienced a steady increase in revenue over the past year. Our team has worked hard to develop and implement new strategies to drive growth and we are pleased with the results we are seeing. [SEP] And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. [SEP] Looking ahead to the next quarter, we expect to see continued growth and anticipate reaching revenues of 175 million. We are also excited to announce a new partnership that will expand our market reach and provide new opportunities for growth in the future.","1489":"Our international sales have been consistently strong, and we are continuously looking for opportunities to expand our global market share. [SEP] And if you look at China, they\u2019re almost 70%. [SEP] This is a trend we expect to continue and we are working diligently to deepen our presence in China and other key international markets. We believe that by focusing on international growth, we will be able to drive sustained revenue gains and increase shareholder value over the long-term.","1490":"Now, let's turn our attention to our social media platforms.

[SEP] It also takes into account the ongoing investments we're making in the longer-term innovation work, which I don't think will necessarily have any meaningful revenue relative to the size of the business in those time frames. [SEP] However, we believe that the investments we're making in innovation are critical for the long-term growth of our company and will position us well for future success.","1493":"Now let's turn our focus to our advertising platform.

Our efforts have resulted in a strong pipeline of devices that we are confident will address the evolving needs of our customers.

We are optimistic about the upcoming quarter and expect to see robust sales growth driven by our exciting product lineup.","1495":"We are pleased to report strong earnings for this quarter.

[SEP] But we now have management data protection and identity systems that cross all devices in the enterprise, including the Internet of Things, and that makes it pretty exciting. [SEP] This has not only improved our ability to protect our own data, but also gives us a competitive advantage when it comes to offering secure solutions to our clients.","1498":"Our company's focus is on providing specialized software solutions to various industry verticals. We believe that creating applications that cater to specific job roles will lead to more productivity and efficiency for our clients. [SEP] In order to do that, you obviously need apps that are written to specific jobs, not just apps that are general productivity apps like work processors and spreadsheets and presentation tools et cetera. [SEP] Therefore, we are investing heavily in our research and development to create industry-specific apps for our clients. We have already launched a product for the healthcare industry, and we plan to expand our offerings to other sectors such as finance, retail, and manufacturing. Our goal is to become the go-to provider of tailor-made software solutions for businesses worldwide.","1499":"We've seen a decline in our revenue over the past few quarters due to the economic downturn. [SEP] But on a sequential basis, we're probably at the trough of that, which is nice. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to implement cost-saving measures and explore new revenue streams to bring us back to growth.","1500":"We have had a lot of success with our new line of supplements. [SEP] It's worth noting this isn't a feed product, so there are some more unknowns here. [SEP] However, we have confidence in the research behind this product and believe it has strong potential in the market.","1501":"We recognize that the market has become increasingly competitive in recent years, with new players entering at a rapid pace. [SEP] And that's where, if you will, our fair share will come from by competing hard where we have to but also mostly thinking about differentiation. [SEP] We are confident that our focus on differentiation will allow us to maintain our market position and continue to grow our business over the long-term.","1502":"We have seen tremendous growth in our cloud computing segment over the past quarter. [SEP] So there actually is some Azure Benefit revenue ultimately that shows \"is on-prem. [SEP] However, we also understand that some customers prefer to keep their data and applications on-premises for security or compliance reasons.","1503":"Our latest product launch has been well-received in the market. [SEP] There were people that were upgrading from X to Y. [SEP] Additionally, we saw a significant increase in sales in the second quarter.","1504":"We've recently launched a new product in that market. [SEP] It's really early, but nice pick up and nice buzz there. [SEP] We're hopeful that the momentum will continue as we invest more in advertising and promotions.","1505":"Our company was able to withstand the pressure brought on by the local competition. [SEP] The local competition was obviously there this quarter and has been there for many quarters before. [SEP] Despite this challenge, we are confident in our ability to continue to outperform and provide value to our customers.","1506":"We're really excited about the new product release and we think it's going to be a game changer in the industry. The development team has been working hard on this for months and we're very proud of what they've accomplished. [SEP] That's actually a pretty \u2013 a very cool set of features that allow both regulators and businesses to have, for example, audit ability and control over their movement in the cloud. [SEP] We've already had a lot of interest from potential customers and we expect sales to be strong in the coming months. This is just one of many innovative products that we have in the pipeline, so stay tuned for more exciting developments from our company.","1507":"We've been asked a lot recently about when we'll start lapping the tougher growth comps on AWS, so I want to address that question head-on. As you know, AWS has been growing rapidly for many years, and as we discussed the past several quarters, our year-over-year growth rates have been impacted by the extraordinary impact of COVID-19 on our business last year. [SEP] On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside, so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. [SEP] Looking at the first quarter, AWS revenue grew 32% year-over-year to $13.5 billion, driven by strong customer usage growth and usage per customer, including increased use of our services for video streaming, remote learning, and collaboration. We continue to see a lot of demand for our services, particularly for machine learning, analytics, and containers, and we're excited about the opportunity ahead.","1508":"As we look at the growth of our teams, it's important to note that they are not just focused on one area. We are expanding our reach into multiple categories, which presents a unique opportunity for us to create a more interconnected platform. [SEP] Teams really expand multiple categories, so I wouldn't think of adjusted productivity or even just collab or meetings but as an interface. [SEP] By developing an interface that allows for seamless collaboration and communication across various categories, we can increase productivity and drive better business outcomes. This approach is already paying off, with strong adoption rates among our existing customer base and promising growth potential in new markets.","1509":"Now, I'd like to turn our attention to our international segment. [SEP] The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth. [SEP] Overall, we're excited about the growth opportunities in both our domestic and international segments, particularly through our FBA program and Amazon fulfillment network.","1510":"We have had tremendous growth in the past quarter, with revenue increasing by 25%. Our market share has also increased significantly, and we are pleased with the direction the company is headed in. [SEP] And so it's huge, and we felt it was important to spell that out. [SEP] As we continue to expand our product line and enter new markets, we believe our growth will only continue. Our team is dedicated to meeting the demands of our customers and providing innovative solutions. We are confident that the future looks bright for our company.","1511":"During the quarter, there were several notable events that occurred in the media. [SEP] Last week there was this case where someone was using Facebook Live to broadcast \u2013 or was thinking about suicide. [SEP] As a company, we take our responsibility to promote safety and well-being on our platform very seriously, and we are constantly working to improve our tools and resources to help prevent such incidents from happening.","1512":"Thank you for joining our earnings conference call today, where we will review our financial results for the most recent quarter. We are pleased to report another strong performance, with revenue growth of 10% year over year. [SEP] So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter. [SEP] As we look ahead, we remain focused on driving sustainable growth through innovation and strategic investments. We expect to continue to invest in our people, our products, and our infrastructure, which we believe will position us for long-term success. Thank you again for your interest and support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.","1513":"As we move into the next quarter, I'd like to take a moment to address our strategic initiatives and the investments we're making to continue to grow our platform. We're focused on investing in areas that will allow us to scale our business and offer more value to our users. [SEP] And those three factors are the ones that I outlined in my commentary: number one, the substantial investment that Mark highlighted that we're making to just improve the security on our platform; two, the video content investments we're making for Watch tab; and then three, additional investments we're making in the long term initiatives like AR\/VR, AI, and connectivity. [SEP] While these investments may impact our short-term profitability, we believe they are critical to our long-term success and will ultimately lead to better outcomes for our shareholders. We're already seeing positive results from some of these initiatives, including increased engagement on the Watch tab and improved user trust in our platform. We remain committed to investing in our future and delivering on our mission to connect the world.","1514":"We often get questions about our ability to weather economic downturns. [SEP] There are some elements that we understand quite well and we tend to manage well over the course of the cycle. [SEP] However, we acknowledge that there are also factors outside of our control that can impact our performance.","1515":"I'd like to provide an update on our company's financial performance. As many of you know, we've been experiencing steady growth over the past few quarters due to our ongoing initiatives to expand our customer base and diversify our revenue streams. Our team has been working tirelessly to deliver exceptional products and services that meet the evolving needs of our customers, and these efforts are starting to pay off. [SEP] Now over a $20 billion run rate [SEP] Looking ahead, we're excited to continue building on this momentum and exploring new growth opportunities. We're investing heavily in research and development to create innovative solutions that will differentiate us from our competitors and position us for long-term success. We're also focused on operational efficiency and cost optimization to drive profitability and maximize shareholder value. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.","1516":"Our cloud-based products continue to see strong growth and adoption among our customer base. [SEP] There is still a need for those on-premise products. [SEP] However, we recognize that some customers have specific requirements or regulations that require them to use on-premise solutions, and we remain committed to providing those options.","1517":"Our strategy for growth has three key elements. [SEP] First, building a consumer use case; then, second, making it so that people can organically interact with businesses; and then third, on top of that, once there's a large volume of people interacting with businesses. [SEP] We believe that this approach will lead to sustainable growth for our company.","1518":"Can you give us an update on the company's expansion plans in India? [SEP] So India is a unique country where there are 1.25 billion people, more than 1 billion of them are not on the Internet. [SEP] What is the company doing to reach these potential customers and bring them online?\" \"Do you see this as a significant growth opportunity for the company?","1519":"Our revenue growth this quarter was driven by a strong performance across all segments. We are seeing continued momentum across our business lines. [SEP] That's direct response, brands, SMBs, and developers. [SEP] We are particularly excited about the opportunities in the SMB market and have invested in enhancing our products for this segment. Our developer community remains a key focus for us as we look to drive innovation and expand our ecosystem. Overall, we are optimistic about our growth prospects and remain committed to delivering value for our customers and shareholders.","1520":"One of the things that's been really pleasing in the last couple of years is the acceleration of our enterprise migrations to the cloud. We're seeing customers now move their most important workloads to AWS. [SEP] Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins. [SEP] And as we continue to innovate and expand our offerings, we believe this trend will only continue. Overall, we're very encouraged by the growth we're seeing in AWS and the opportunities ahead.","1521":"Now let's turn to our growth trajectory for the coming year. [SEP] because, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our installed base of customers and devices is growing, and is growing very significantly [SEP] This expansion has enabled us to capture a larger share of the market and generate more recurring revenue from our existing customers.","1522":"During the quarter, our marketing team ran a successful campaign using Facebook Messenger ads to promote our latest LEGO sets. [SEP] They reached people over 25 years old in the U.S., UK, France and Germany, and targeted people who are interested in LEGO toys and shopping, and they found a 3.4 times higher return on ad spend for click-to-Messenger ads versus those that just linked to the LEGO website. [SEP] We plan to continue leveraging Messenger ads in our upcoming marketing campaigns, as we have seen positive results and higher engagement rates with this platform.","1523":"Our team has been working hard on developing new ad formats and we're excited to announce our latest addition. [SEP] And I think the way people largely think about this is this is another way of using the Facebook ad system, including our targeting and measurement capabilities, to create ads that are great creative that can reach people. [SEP] We've already seen great success with this new ad format, with a 30% increase in click-through rates compared to traditional ads.","1524":"Our e-commerce business has seen significant growth over the past quarter. [SEP] That shows up in our online stores classification. [SEP] We are also seeing strong engagement with our online customers through our social media channels.","1525":"We understand the importance of managing content in an efficient and effective manner, particularly given recent concerns about the spread of misinformation and inappropriate content on our platform. [SEP] I think that we have some confidence in that timeframe, which takes us through the end of about 2019, to get our systems to the level that we generally think that they should be at, where we're building AI systems that can flag content that might be problematic to a much larger security and review team that can manage the larger volume of stuff that our tools are flagging to them. [SEP] In addition to our AI and security efforts, we are also investing in improving our review processes and training our team members to be more adept at identifying and addressing potentially problematic content.","1526":"As we review our results for the quarter, we are proud to report that we have achieved record-breaking revenue and earnings per share. Our team has been working tirelessly to deliver innovative products and services that meet the evolving needs of our customers. [SEP] And of course a key part of that was iPhone. [SEP] Our iPhone sales were particularly strong in the Asia-Pacific region, where we saw a 20% increase in units sold compared to the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming launch of our new iPhone models and believe they will continue to drive growth for the company. We remain committed to delivering exceptional value to our shareholders and customers alike.","1527":"We've been looking at ways to optimize our portfolio and make sure that each product we have is delivering the maximum value to our users. [SEP] Some of them get clear value by being separate, like Messenger, for example, where we can make sure that everyone has their push notifications turned on, which is extremely important for a messaging app. [SEP] On the other hand, we've found that integrating certain services can create a more seamless user experience and ultimately drive engagement and growth across our platform.","1528":"Now let's turn our attention to the revenue numbers for this quarter. As you can see from the report, we experienced a 10% sequential decline. This is not entirely unexpected given the challenging business environment we are operating in. [SEP] So when you take those factors into account, I think that explains the sequential decline that we see this year. [SEP] However, I would like to highlight that our year-over-year revenue growth is still strong at 20%. We have also taken steps to mitigate the impact of the factors mentioned earlier. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to navigate through these challenges and deliver value to our shareholders.","1529":"Our priority is to improve our customers' experience by providing fast and reliable shipping options. [SEP] We've in the past months significantly expanded our one-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for one-day shipping. [SEP] As a result, we've seen a substantial increase in customer satisfaction scores and a significant boost in sales.","1530":"During the past quarter, we have seen a significant increase in engagement on our core platform. [SEP] People consume News Feed stories. [SEP] Our goal is to continue providing high-quality content that keeps users coming back to our platform.","1531":"One analyst on the call asked about the expected impact on EPS from an acquisition that had recently been announced. [SEP] The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS dilution on \u2013 excluding the impact of purchase accounting, being minimally dilutive, 1% plus or minus, stands, including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses. [SEP] The CEO added that the company is confident in its ability to integrate the acquisition smoothly and deliver on the synergies that had been identified. They also reiterated their commitment to shareholder value and said that they were excited about the potential for growth in the coming quarters.","1532":"We\u2019re very pleased to report strong growth in our third quarter earnings. [SEP] They\u2019ve had great success on our site, the -- more than half of our units sold are from third party sellers. [SEP] Third party sellers have become an increasingly important part of our business model and we expect this trend to continue in the future.","1533":"As we move forward with our sustainability goals, it's important to consider all aspects of our supply chain. [SEP] When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece [SEP] We have been working with our suppliers to implement more sustainable practices, and measuring the impact of these changes will be key in achieving our goals.","1534":"Now, moving on to our product categories. [SEP] There is a wide variety of products included in that category: smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. [SEP] But despite the wide variety of products, we have seen a significant increase in sales in this category over the past quarter.","1535":"Can you speak to how your products are able to serve different industries and market segments? [SEP] For the most part, when we build products, we build them to work for all verticals, and you see us do that. [SEP] However, have you considered creating products tailored specifically to certain verticals in order to capture more market share in those areas?","1536":"During the quarter, we continued to focus on growing our small business user base. [SEP] We announced last year that we have over 50 million small business pages active on a monthly basis. [SEP] This growth in small business pages has resulted in a significant increase in advertising revenue for the company.","1537":"Our software has been performing exceptionally well this quarter, and we are pleased with the strong growth we have seen so far. [SEP] They're consistent, the dynamic mix in terms of emerging markets and developed as well as enterprise sizing is not an ASP problem in Pro. [SEP] Additionally, our customer retention rates remain high, which is a testament to the value our software brings to businesses of all sizes.","1538":"We've been closely monitoring the growth and development of augmented reality technology in various industries. [SEP] There's a lot of interest out there and the number of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping, to I was in China a few weeks ago and saw AR in an art sense, in an art exhibit. [SEP] Our team is exploring potential partnerships and investment opportunities in this space to stay ahead of the competition and provide value to our customers.","1539":"One area of potential growth we have been closely monitoring is our Stories feature. [SEP] We do think there's opportunities to improve the value of the Stories format that will translate into better price for Stories. [SEP] Our team is currently researching ways to enhance the user experience of Stories and provide advertisers with more targeted and effective advertising options.","1540":"Our messaging platform has been on the rise in terms of usage and engagement, particularly among younger demographics who prioritize convenience and privacy. [SEP] In terms of transactions, one of the big things that we see happening in messaging long term is that it's a great channel for people to interact with a business one on one and either do transactions in a private space or get support, or for businesses to reach out with very personally tailored messages and have an ongoing engagement with a person. [SEP] We're investing heavily in our messaging capabilities and exploring new ways to enhance the user experience, such as integrating shopping and payment features. We believe this will drive increased user adoption and ultimately lead to higher revenue growth for the company.","1541":"Our supply chain had to reconfigure itself significantly due to the pandemic. \n- We've been monitoring customer demand, and we see a very positive trend for the upcoming fiscal quarter. [SEP] And we purchase that glass and essentially export it to the world with iPhones and iPads. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with our performance this quarter, especially considering the challenges we faced. \n- Our team is already working on initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce costs further.","1542":"We are very pleased with how our recent digital ad campaign performed. [SEP] What's nice is that the same targeting, the same measurement systems really work. [SEP] We believe this consistency can help us optimize our marketing efforts and drive stronger results in the future.","1543":"Our sales have increased significantly quarter over quarter. [SEP] We think that the performance will continue to improve. [SEP] We have implemented new marketing strategies that we believe will further drive growth.","1544":"We are now going to discuss the current market trends and how they are affecting our business. [SEP] And in this context I think we see a mix. [SEP] Some of our products are seeing increased demand, while others are experiencing a decline.","1545":"Thank you for your question about our current royalty payments. [SEP] In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. [SEP] We are actively working to resolve the disagreement and reach a fair agreement that works for all parties involved.","1546":"Can you explain how the Dynamic Product Ads (DPA) process works in terms of bidding for ad placement? [SEP] So it doesn't necessarily mean you're paying a premium for a given product and so if we've got a good DPA ad that might win in the auction for a given user. [SEP] This allows us to maximize our return on investment while still providing relevant ads to our users.","1547":"We will now open up the call for questions. [SEP] Your first question on international, yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. [SEP] In our next fiscal year, we plan to expand our international presence even further.","1548":"Our e-commerce business is continuing to thrive and has seen significant growth in the past quarter. [SEP] I think we launched a couple more Prime Now cities just today, so that brings us up to about 17 across the globe. [SEP] We are also seeing strong demand for our grocery delivery services, which has exceeded our initial projections.","1549":"As we move into the next quarter, let's take a closer look at our financials. [SEP] If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we got an expense to revenue ratio of 9%. [SEP] This represents a slight increase from our previous quarter, but we are confident in our ability to manage expenses while continuing to drive revenue growth.","1550":"We will now turn to the financial results for the last quarter. [SEP] There is no obvious impact from the last quarter in the Greater China numbers [SEP] However, we did see a significant increase in sales in our European markets.","1551":"Our next question comes from John from JP Morgan. John, over to you. [SEP] And frankly over time and watching, I think both the creativity and the pace of innovation we\u2019ve seen coming out of our engineering teams particularly in Azure and Office 365 and our CRM team online, I actually even have more confidence in our ability to attach and grow that gross profit over time. [SEP] Thank you. Our last question comes from Jane from Goldman Sachs. Jane, over to you.\n\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. CEO for any additional or closing remarks. \n\nCEO: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased with our strong Q2 results and remain optimistic about our future growth prospects. Our teams continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions to our customers and driving value for our shareholders. We appreciate the support of our investors and look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. Thank you.","1552":"Our international expansion efforts have continued to be successful. [SEP] We launched Echo and Alexa in France. [SEP] We are seeing strong demand for Echo and Alexa in the French market.","1553":"We've seen a lot of growth in our advertising platform this quarter and we're pleased with the results. Our focus has been on improving the platform's targeting capabilities. [SEP] In terms of ROI on the platform, the ROI is really determined by the ability of advertisers to put the right ad in front of the right person in the right format. [SEP] To that end, we're continuing to invest in our data analytics and machine learning capabilities. We believe that this will enable us to deliver even better results for our advertisers in the future. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that every ad on our platform delivers real value for both advertisers and users.","1554":"We're now seeing strong growth in our consumer segment, with the number of users increasing steadily over the past few quarters. [SEP] Once we've built this installed base up to 18 million users on the consumer side, that recurring rate does in fact offset the deferral from new, and so it is an important inflection point for us this quarter. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're confident that we can continue to build our installed base and drive strong recurring revenue growth, which is a key priority for us moving forward.","1555":"Our revenue growth has not been as strong as we anticipated. [SEP] but we have significant actions going on to really deepen that. [SEP] We are confident that these efforts will improve our financial performance in the long run.","1556":"Thank you for your question, we believe that the future of our company lies in the continued success of our cloud-based services. [SEP] And that will be a constant battle between, again, growth, geographic expansion in AWS and also efficiencies to limit how much we actually need. [SEP] Additionally, we are always exploring new technologies and innovations to help us achieve both growth and efficiency in our operations.","1557":"We have seen some fluctuations in our revenue over the past few quarters. [SEP] I think it tends to not be as big a factor, sequentially quarter-over-quarter is the gradual growth in it. [SEP] However, we anticipate that our latest product launch will significantly increase our revenue in the next quarter. Our team is also working on improving our marketing strategies to drive more sales in the upcoming months.","1558":"Now I would like to touch on some of the changes we've made at Facebook over the past few months. [SEP] One is that we just started getting a lot of feedback from people in the community that they wanted Facebook to be more about connecting with people, which is really the core of what it's always been, less so about viral videos or news content and just passive consumption. [SEP] In response to this feedback, we have made a number of changes to the news feed algorithm to prioritize posts from friends, family, and groups over public content.","1559":"During the quarter, our advertising campaigns did not perform as well as we had anticipated. We experienced lower than expected click-through rates and lower conversion rates. [SEP] They are only about 65% accurate in demographic targeting, they don't work on mobile because they are cookie based, they don't work on multiple devices, they don't go off-line to on-line and they overemphasize the last click and reach. [SEP] These challenges are not unique to our company, as advertisers across the industry are facing similar issues. We are exploring alternative advertising methods, such as influencer marketing and native advertising. Additionally, we are investing in improving our targeting and attribution capabilities to drive better results for our advertising partners.","1560":"As we review our progress in the gaming segment, we are thrilled to see promising results from our Mixer platform. [SEP] And we feel very, very good about the engagement increases in a pretty unique value proposition we have in Mixer. [SEP] Our team is continuously working on improving the platform and adding more features to make it an even better experience for our users. We are excited to see what the future holds for Mixer as we continue to strive for growth and success in the gaming market.","1561":"We've continued to see strong adoption of our business solutions among our customers. This quarter, we saw a 20% increase in usage and a 15% increase in new customer acquisition. [SEP] And clearly that's increasing engagement as well and that obviously then translates into revenue growth of those business solutions we mentioned. [SEP] We believe that this momentum will continue as our customers increasingly realize the value that our solutions can bring to their businesses. In the coming quarters, we will continue to invest in innovation and expanding our product offerings to meet their evolving needs.","1562":"One analyst asked about the company's strategy for acquiring new businesses to its network. [SEP] So instead of focusing on ads first, what we did was we built pages, and we made that free, that way as many businesses as possible could get into the network. [SEP] This approach has proven successful, and we now have over 50 million businesses using our pages to connect with customers. As a result, we've been able to leverage this network for advertising and generate significant revenue.","1563":"Our team has been focused on expanding and innovating in our core business, and we've seen a lot of success there. [SEP] And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there is a lot of headroom there in our mind, and so we are working very hard to realize that opportunity. [SEP] We've also been exploring some new markets and opportunities, which we believe have the potential to drive even more growth. As always, we're committed to investing in our people and infrastructure to ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders.","1564":"We've been investing heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities in recent years. [SEP] But the combination of building AI and hiring what is going to be tens of thousands of people to work on these problems, I think will see us make very meaningful progress going forward. [SEP] Our ultimate goal is to use these technologies to improve the lives of people all around the world, whether it's through more efficient healthcare, better transportation systems, or more effective disaster response.","1565":"We've noticed that there's been some concern around the volatility in our quarterly results, and we wanted to take the time to address that today. [SEP] And so the inherent volatility that you are talking about really is about changes in-quarter that we see and the impact of that. [SEP] That being said, we're confident in our ability to manage this volatility and remain focused on our long-term goals for the company.","1566":"We've been closely monitoring our financials over the past few quarters. [SEP] So that was pretty much in line with what we were anticipating [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made and remain optimistic about our future growth potential.","1567":"Our profits have been lower than expected for the past quarter. [SEP] However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. [SEP] That being said, we have made significant investments in infrastructure and anticipate seeing the benefits of that in the coming months.","1568":"Our international expansion strategy has been a major focus for us. [SEP] We rolled out Prime last summer if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there. [SEP] We've seen a significant increase in Prime memberships and engagement in that market since launching these services.","1569":"During the last quarter, our team has been working hard to bring our customers the latest in cutting-edge technology. [SEP] We\u2019ve now developed two new iPhones over the year. [SEP] The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and we look forward to continuing to innovate in the years to come.","1570":"Our marketing team has been working tirelessly to increase brand awareness and drive demand for our products. [SEP] We can move people down that marketing funnel from demand generation to demand fulfillment. [SEP] By providing excellent customer service and support, we can also turn those fulfilled demands into loyal customers who will continue to use our products in the future.","1571":"We have seen tremendous growth in our company over the past year. [SEP] So, to me staying with that and staying focused on our unique contribution is perhaps are both on opportunity and our challenge and we will obviously index on the opportunity side. [SEP] By continuing to focus on our unique contribution, we believe we can continue this upward trend in the future.","1572":"Now let's discuss our performance in the first quarter of the fiscal year. [SEP] This quarter in Q1 we were up 60 basis points year-over-year in total at the upper end of that forecast implied would be up 80 basis points, so again, that\u2019s the range and we think its appropriate range for Q2. [SEP] We are confident that our strategic initiatives will continue to drive growth and provide value for our shareholders.","1573":"Now turning to our company's growth strategy. [SEP] The analogy that I always use is the first smartphones came out in 2003, right, the BlackBerry and Palm Treo, and it took 10 years to get to 1 billion units. [SEP] And I believe that we are on a similar path with our product.","1574":"We're often asked about our approach to advertising and how we've been able to maintain a strong revenue stream while keeping our users engaged. I think it comes down to a fundamentally different approach that we took early on in the company's history. [SEP] where if you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the experience, and what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and monetization would perform better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses. [SEP] I'm happy to report that our strategy has proven successful. Our revenue growth has been consistent year over year, and we've been able to maintain a high level of user engagement. We believe this is because we've prioritized building a platform that connects users with businesses in a natural, authentic way.","1575":"Our quarterly earnings report shows strong growth across all our product lines and geographies.

[SEP] So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that. [SEP] Of course, we're always looking for ways to improve and adapt to changes in consumer behavior. One area where we see potential for growth is in influencer partnerships, and we plan to explore that avenue more in the coming months. But overall, we're confident that our strong digital marketing capabilities will continue to drive our business forward.","1578":"Our cloud platform continues to gain traction in the market, and we are thrilled to report another quarter of strong growth. As more customers shift towards cloud-based solutions, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.

Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the future and are committed to delivering innovative products and services to our customers.","1579":"We've seen really strong growth this quarter and we're excited to share some of the details with you now.

Through our continued efforts, we are confident we can achieve these goals and continue to exceed expectations.","1581":"We had a strong quarter and are very pleased with our financial results.

[SEP] We expect those two factors to be offset by positive leverage, because you've seen the revenue guidance that we provided and the mix to services that you've actually mentioned during your question. [SEP] Overall, we remain optimistic about our ability to achieve our financial targets and continue to grow our business in the current market environment.","1584":"We have received feedback from some of our customers regarding certain product defects.

[SEP] We take customer satisfaction very seriously and will continue to monitor and address any concerns that arise.","1585":"During the first quarter, we continued to see strong demand for our cloud services, and we are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum going forward. Our revenue from cloud services grew by 20% year-over-year, driven by a combination of increased usage and new customer acquisitions. [SEP] And so we have a lot of value that is across the board cloud services, whether it's Xbox Live, Windows Update, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and of course all of the Azure services.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, with overall revenue up 8% year over year. Today, we'll be focusing on our AWS segment, which continues to be a key driver of our growth. [SEP] So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services.

[SEP] We have seen great success with this approach, as engagement and watch time on the platform have both increased significantly.","1593":"Now, let's take a look at our performance in emerging markets. [SEP] Emerging markets ex-China were up 18% year on year. [SEP] This growth was largely driven by strong sales in Southeast Asia and Latin America.","1594":"Now, moving on to our financial performance for the year. [SEP] But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out. [SEP] First, our procurement team has done an excellent job negotiating favorable contracts with our suppliers, resulting in significant savings on raw material costs. Additionally, our IT team has successfully implemented streamlined processes and automation tools, leading to lower labor costs in our operations. Finally, our sales and marketing team has executed targeted campaigns that have generated strong returns on investment while keeping costs in check. Overall, our focus on cost management has been a major contributor to our strong financial performance this year.","1595":"We've seen continued growth on Instagram, but it's important to keep in mind that it's still a relatively new platform for us. [SEP] Instagram remains small relative to Facebook and it's going to really take time to have significant impact on our growth. [SEP] That being said, we're investing in new features and expanding our advertising options on Instagram, which we believe will help drive growth in the long term.","1596":"Our expansion into the European market has been a major focus over the past year. [SEP] We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers.

We believe that this approach will help us create sustainable value for our customers and shareholders over the long term.","1598":"We have been investing heavily in the development of our VR platform, Oculus, and we're excited about the progress that we've made so far. Our goal has been to create a complete ecosystem that enables users to experience immersive, interactive content in a way that has never been possible before. [SEP] But as we do arrangements to get the ecosystem going, some of that could get picked up in sales and marketing, and then we have content as well that's getting picked up in R&D for the efforts we're making with Oculus. [SEP] We believe that the potential for VR is enormous, and we're committed to investing in this technology for the long term. We're already seeing strong interest from consumers and content creators alike, and we're working hard to build out a robust ecosystem that will support the growth of this market. We're confident that our efforts will pay off in the coming years as VR becomes more mainstream and more widely adopted.","1599":"We've seen incredible growth in our user base over the past year, with more and more people turning to our platform for their daily dose of news and entertainment. [SEP] And you can imagine that as the tools for any of this content get better, people taking photos, newspapers, writing news articles, advertisers, putting out ads for content that they want to sell, the better that content gets, the more people are excited to see it and then that informs the ranking in what the community qualitatively tells us that they want to see from us over time as well.

[SEP] Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. [SEP] This was largely due to strong sales in our international markets and the successful launch of our new product line. We believe this momentum will continue into the next quarter and the rest of the fiscal year.","1603":"Let's talk about our projections for the second quarter of this fiscal year. [SEP] But sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to monitor market conditions and make adjustments as needed, but we don't anticipate any major surprises.","1604":"We've been focusing heavily on incorporating artificial intelligence into our platform.

We believe that by staying focused on delivering value to our customers, we can continue to grow and achieve sustainable success. Thank you for your support and trust in our company.","1606":"We have been investing heavily in user engagement and retention on our platform.

[SEP] We have seen an increase in user engagement over the past quarter and we plan to continue to offer compelling content to keep users on our platform.","1607":"Now let's move on to discuss our performance in international markets. [SEP] Switching outside of China was up year-on-year, and so we're happy with that. [SEP] However, we still see significant potential for growth in China and will continue to invest in expanding our presence there.","1608":"We've seen significant growth in our technology division over the past year, driven by strategic investments in emerging technologies. I'm pleased to say that we've achieved some very promising results as a result of these investments. [SEP] The things that I would point to are things like AI as well as our investments in AR and VR.

As we look to the future, we remain committed to exploring new ways to leverage these technologies to enhance our business and deliver even greater value to our customers.","1609":"Our focus on improving the user experience and introducing new features has strengthened engagement on the platform.

[SEP] This has become especially important as we've seen an increase in fake news and misinformation being spread online.","1611":"We've been working hard to improve our targeting capabilities over the past quarter, and I'm thrilled to report that our efforts have paid off. [SEP] That's actually pretty specific targeting that lets them hit exactly the right audience and amplify what they were doing on TV, and I think that's the kind of thing that only we can do at scale, and it shows how important targeting is. [SEP] As we continue to refine our targeting algorithms and expand our reach, I believe we'll be able to unlock even more value for our clients and shareholders alike.","1612":"We are pleased to report strong Q3 earnings results across all our operating regions. Our sales growth has continued to outpace the industry average, driven by robust demand for our new product offerings and expanded distribution network. [SEP] So that\u2019s promising, but we continue to see Europe growing just a bit slower than the rest of the regions. [SEP] Despite some headwinds in certain markets, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for our business. We are actively investing in R&D and marketing initiatives to drive innovation and expand our customer base, which we believe will help us sustain our momentum in the coming quarters.","1613":"We have spent a considerable amount of time examining the market trends and analyzing our performance.

This is why we show a different News Feed to each of our over 2 billion users worldwide. [SEP] And basically what \u2013 the way to think about this is that, even if a lot of your friends come from the same kind of background or have the same political or religious beliefs, if you know a couple of hundred people, there's a good chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have different viewpoints, which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed.

[SEP] However, we are implementing pricing strategies to address this issue and expect to see improvement in the next quarter.","1734":"Thank you for your question. [SEP] The second thing, as you pointed out in your question, is we have a business model advantage. [SEP] Our business model advantage has allowed us to be more competitive in the market and capture a larger share of customers.","1735":"Our newest product line has been performing exceptionally well in the market, and we are thrilled to share our latest earnings report with all of you today. [SEP] because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1. [SEP] We expect to stabilize demand for the product over the next few quarters, as the initial hype begins to die down. Nevertheless, we are confident that this line will continue to be a top performer for us, and we look forward to seeing unparalleled growth across all our product categories in the upcoming year.","1736":"Moving on to our international operations, I'd like to highlight some of our recent product launches. [SEP] We've also launched video benefits most recently in Japan, but we have them in the U.K. and Germany. [SEP] We've seen a tremendous response from our users in these markets and plan to continue expanding our video benefits offerings globally.","1737":"We have received some questions from investors about our approach to privacy and artificial intelligence. [SEP] In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, but at a high level, I think it's a false trade-off that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. [SEP] However, we believe that it is possible to achieve both privacy and AI capabilities without compromising either.","1738":"We faced some challenges in our international markets last quarter. [SEP] But you can see that China rebounded. [SEP] We are optimistic about the growth potential in China for the remainder of the year.","1739":"One of our priorities this year has been to focus on growth. [SEP] This year \u2013 we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. [SEP] We feel confident that our strategy is working and are excited to see what the future holds.","1740":"Our company has seen tremendous growth in the e-commerce space. [SEP] Prime Now is a huge benefit that didn't even exist two years ago. [SEP] We attribute much of our success to the investments we've made in technology and infrastructure, such as Prime Now.","1741":"We're committed to driving growth and profitability across our business segments. Our priorities are to expand our customer base, increase engagement, and drive higher yields. We're making strategic investments to accelerate our momentum. [SEP] We're still focused on continuing to have that sequential improvement, and especially as some of the things Satya talked about, which is the addition of premium services, the pace of innovation especially on the premium end. [SEP] Our strategy to offer high-value, differentiated services and products is resonating with customers. We're seeing strong adoption of our premium offerings, which are driving incremental revenue and margin expansion. We're also investing heavily in research and development to ensure that we continue to innovate and lead the market in cutting-edge technology solutions.","1742":"When we analyze our cloud business, there are a couple of important points that I want to highlight. [SEP] And second is we don't think of Azure in isolation. [SEP] We view it as part of a broader set of services that we offer to our customers.","1743":"When looking at our latest market analysis, we are seeing some positive trends that are worth noting. [SEP] And so I think the demographics are great. [SEP] Additionally, we've made some strategic partnerships that we believe will help us reach a wider audience. \nFull statement: When looking at our latest market analysis, we are seeing some positive trends that are worth noting. And so I think the demographics are great. Additionally, we've made some strategic partnerships that we believe will help us reach a wider audience.","1744":"We are pleased to announce that we have made a significant investment in a promising startup company that is poised for growth in the near future. [SEP] So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base. [SEP] We believe that this strategic investment will provide long-term benefits for both our customers and shareholders.","1745":"Can you speak to the metrics that the management team is paying closest attention to this quarter? [SEP] We are much more focused on free cash flow dollars and operating profit dollars. [SEP] We believe that these two metrics are the most important in driving long-term shareholder value.","1746":"Our product development team has been closely monitoring the replacement cycle trends in the industry. [SEP] In terms of replacement cycles, as I'd mentioned I think on a previous call, some replacement cycles are lengthening. [SEP] However, we are seeing that certain segments of our customer base are still maintaining their traditional replacement cycles.","1747":"We've invested heavily in our technology and infrastructure over the past year, and we're seeing some exciting results. Our latest platform is a true game-changer for our business, and we're confident that it will boost our performance in the coming quarters. [SEP] It's much more modular, it's modern, it's extensible with this power platform that gives us the ability to do things for customers and serve them in ways that is very differentiated. [SEP] Our teams have already started exploring the many possibilities of this platform, and we're already seeing some amazing innovations. From personalized experiences to new products and services, we're confident that this platform will help us stay ahead of the competition and deliver real value to our customers. We're excited to see what the future holds and look forward to sharing more updates with you in the near future.","1748":"We are seeing significant growth potential in the digital and e-commerce space. [SEP] And so there is a lot of investment and a lot of efforts going on that front. [SEP] We believe that this investment will pay off in the long run as we continue to adapt to changing consumer preferences and behavior.","1749":"We have received a lot of questions about whether we will be expanding into new markets. [SEP] We don't think that that's what we're uniquely here to do. [SEP] Our focus continues to be on providing the best possible service to our current customer base and expanding our offerings within the markets that we are already established in.","1750":"Moving on to our next question. [SEP] I think the entire Senior Leadership Team views it as an opportunity to think about where we can best innovate and drive the highest value of every dollar that we invest and I think we've made great progress as a team and I think you're seeing that both in the long-term guidance and in frankly our day-to-day execution through the quarter. [SEP] Thank you for your question.","1751":"Our investment in autonomous systems has yielded exciting results. [SEP] And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways and a vehicle is only one. [SEP] We're already exploring partnerships with logistics companies to integrate our autonomous technology into their operations.","1752":"I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO to discuss our recent financial results and business operations. [SEP] We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain committed to expanding our presence in the Indian market and driving growth for our business in this region.","1753":"During the last quarter, we have been working tirelessly to meet the increasing demand for our products. [SEP] We are selling them as fast as we can make them, the demand has been strong and the content is starting to pick up both on the AAA, really high quality side and some of the stuff that I think is quite good. [SEP] In addition, we have been investing heavily in our research and development department to come up with even better and more innovative products to meet the needs of our valued customers. We are confident that our efforts will continue to drive growth and profitability for the company well into the future.","1754":"Can you talk more about how your sales strategy has evolved over the past year? [SEP] Because it tends to be project-based as well and many of the investments we've made in sales capacity, and the reason we did some of the sales transformation, was to invest a lot more in that project-led motion, which is a bit disconnected actually from the EA renewal cycle, and you've really seen that. [SEP] So you expect to see continued growth in the project-led sales numbers in the next quarter?","1755":"We have ambitious plans for growth and expansion in the coming years. [SEP] But 2015 is a big investment year for us across the board. [SEP] We anticipate that these investments will position us well for long-term success and profitability.","1756":"We're very pleased with the results this quarter. [SEP] And so there's actually several vectors there that are working well for us. [SEP] One of the main drivers of our success has been our ability to increase sales in new markets.","1757":"Now let's take a look at our employee growth. [SEP] So it increased 51% year-over-year in Q2 versus a head count increase of 42%. [SEP] We believe that our strong growth in head count contributed greatly to our success in Q2.","1758":"We are excited to announce a new product launch. [SEP] It's still in early days. [SEP] However, we anticipate great success in the coming quarters. \n\n\"It's still in early days. We are excited to announce a new product launch. However, we anticipate great success in the coming quarters.","1759":"One of the questions we've been getting a lot lately relates to content and our efforts to monetize that content. [SEP] So you're definitely right that there's a certain class of content which is only going to come on to Facebook if there's a good way to compensate the content owners for that. [SEP] That's something that we're actively working on, and we hope to have some updates soon about ways we can better support content creators on our platform.","1760":"As we move forward with our plans for expansion and innovation, we have some very exciting news to share today. [SEP] We're very excited about GitHub closing. [SEP] This acquisition is a game-changer for our company and will open up a world of possibilities for collaboration and growth. We're confident that the integration of GitHub into our platform will be seamless and transformational.","1761":"Now I'd like to shift the conversation to our international operations. [SEP] We're investing in India obviously, and have seen good traction there. [SEP] Our team in India has been exceptional and we're eager to continue building our presence in the region.","1762":"We've seen some good progress in our advertising efforts, with a significant uptick in engagement and clicks. [SEP] And there, we're relying on continuing to improve targeting. [SEP] We're also exploring new channels for reaching our target audience, including social media and influencer partnerships.","1763":"Our iPhone 7 Plus was in high demand this past year, with many customers eager to get their hands on the new model. We had to ramp up production quickly to keep up with the demand. [SEP] And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter. [SEP] Now that we've brought iPhone 7 Plus into balance, we're focusing on meeting demand for our other products, such as the Apple Watch and the MacBook Pro. We're also looking ahead to the launch of the next iPhone model and are prepared to meet the high demand that we anticipate for that product as well.","1764":"We're now going to take a question from the line. [SEP] I think seat growth will come more from material increases internationally as well as with some of the regulated segments of the market finally moving to the cloud. [SEP] Thank you for your question. Yes, we are optimistic about our seat growth potential in the coming quarters.","1765":"Our cloud computing segment has continued to see impressive growth over the past quarter. [SEP] We now have 42 availability zones in 16 geographic regions and we will continue to grow that business globally. [SEP] This strategic expansion allows us to better serve our customers by providing them with a wider range of cloud infrastructure solutions.","1766":"Thank you for joining our earnings call today. [SEP] The core of our business is really connecting people with what they care about. [SEP] And we're seeing that come to life more than ever, as we continue to innovate and evolve our platform to better serve our users.","1767":"One of our key focus areas has been expanding our international presence. [SEP] And I think it'll be interesting to see how that plays out over the next horizon. [SEP] We are optimistic about our growth potential and remain committed to executing our strategic initiatives.","1768":"We have been closely monitoring our financial performance over the last several months and wanted to share our projections for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] On one side, we expect -- on the positive side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. [SEP] However, on the negative side, we do anticipate increased operating expenses related to new product development. Additionally, we may see an impact on our margins from the current supply chain disruptions in the market. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets for the year.","1769":"We've been working hard to expand our advertising capabilities [SEP] So the long run view should be that you can give us maybe simple pictures, maybe simple videos, maybe an ad you\u2019ve produced, and we can do the placement for you [SEP] and we believe this new service will provide even greater value to our clients.","1770":"Thank you for joining us today on our earnings conference call. I'm here with our CFO, Lisa, and our CTO, John. We're excited to share with you our Q2 results. [SEP] What used to be large accounts for us, for example, are not by PC count anymore, and that's a pretty fundamental change. [SEP] As we've seen a shift towards mobility and cloud-based solutions, our sales strategy has had to adapt. Instead of selling to a few big clients with a lot of computers, we're now working with a larger number of small to medium-sized businesses with fewer devices. This has not only changed our revenue model, but also the way we deliver customer service and support. We're confident that our continued focus on innovation and flexibility will keep us ahead of the curve in this ever-changing market.","1771":"Our sales have been steadily increasing over the past few quarters. [SEP] And so we are optimistic over time. [SEP] However, we do anticipate some challenges in the upcoming quarter due to market conditions.","1772":"Our company has been investing heavily in improving the developer experience and building out our platform's capabilities. [SEP] I couldn't be happier with the rate and face of the developer community, how faster developing these things. [SEP] We've seen a significant increase in the number of third-party integrations and extensions being developed, which is a testament to the quality of our APIs.","1773":"Thank you for joining us on this earnings conference call. We are pleased to announce strong financial results for the quarter, with revenue increasing by 12% and net income up by 15%. As we move forward, we expect continued growth in all of our business segments. [SEP] So, again, that will have a modest impact on growth. [SEP] However, we are also facing some challenges in the current market environment. The pandemic has disrupted supply chains and caused fluctuations in consumer demand, which has led to some volatility in our sales figures. Additionally, we are keeping a close eye on regulatory changes that could impact our operations. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic about our prospects for the rest of the year, and we are confident that our strong fundamentals and strategic initiatives will drive long-term success.","1774":"Regarding the acquisition of XYZ Company, we are currently in the final stages of due diligence and negotiations. [SEP] We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. [SEP] Once the deal is finalized, we will share more information with our investors and stakeholders.","1775":"One of the key reasons why we're seeing strong growth in our cloud business is our focus on offering a truly open and flexible platform. [SEP] We participated only in a portion of it, whereas with Azure, we can participate as the total open platform. [SEP] This has enabled us to attract a wide range of customers, from startups and SMBs to large enterprises, who value the ability to customize and integrate our cloud services with their existing systems.","1776":"Good news everyone, I am pleased to announce that our business in India has seen a remarkable recovery in the last quarter.\n2. Despite the challenging economic conditions, our team in India has been working tirelessly to overcome the hurdles and get us back on track.\n3. As we shared in our previous call, we were optimistic about the potential of the Indian market and it seems that our beliefs were well-founded. [SEP] India bounced back. [SEP] This is an incredible achievement and we are proud of the effort put in by our Indian teams.\n2. Our future plans will undoubtedly consider the resurgence of the Indian market and how we can capitalize on this momentum.\n3. We are committed to staying the course and continue working towards making this comeback sustainable in the long term.","1777":"Thank you for your question. Next question please. [SEP] We\u2019re just very excited about all the \u2013 everything in this area and it\u2019s one of the biggest areas that we\u2019re focused on for the next several years. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to develop new technologies and solutions to drive growth in this area. We believe that our investments in this space will pay off in the long term and position us for continued success in the industry.","1778":"One of our key advertising strategies last quarter was to increase our online presence through targeted advertising. [SEP] They used reach and frequency and Carousel and video ad targeting. [SEP] As a result of these efforts, we saw a significant increase in website traffic and brand recognition.","1779":"As we have seen in the past year, our industry can be quite volatile.\n- Considering the current economic climate, we are cautiously optimistic about our projections for the rest of the year. [SEP] I would encourage you just to move it into Q4 as you think about what to expect. [SEP] Additionally, we are closely monitoring the impact of any potential supply chain disruptions.\n- Thank you all for your time today, and we look forward to updating you in our next earnings call.","1780":"Looking back at our previous quarter, we saw exceptional results. [SEP] We believe it's the toughest compare [SEP] sentence: However, we must acknowledge that the upcoming quarter will not be easy to beat.\n\nFull statement: Looking back at our previous quarter, we saw exceptional results. However, we must acknowledge that the upcoming quarter will not be easy to beat. We believe it's the toughest compare yet due to external factors such as increased competition and a volatile market.","1781":"We have implemented a number of cost savings measures to help offset the economic challenges posed by the pandemic. One area where we think we can achieve significant savings is in our general and administrative (G&A) expenses. [SEP] And then you're going to also just have overall impact on G&A as well for things like policy-related expenses and the like. [SEP] We have identified a number of areas where we can reduce our G&A expenses without compromising our ability to deliver high-quality products and services to our customers. In addition to policy-related expenses, we will be looking closely at overhead costs, travel and entertainment expenses, and other discretionary spending. As we move forward, we will continue to evaluate our cost structure and make adjustments as needed to ensure that we remain competitive and financially strong.","1782":"We have been experiencing some challenges with our profit margins recently. [SEP] As I mentioned, I think to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products. [SEP] However, we are working on implementing cost-saving strategies to mitigate this issue moving forward.","1783":"Our company has been investing heavily in video technology over the past few years. [SEP] Video I think will be huge. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in engagement and revenue from our video content, and we believe this trend will only continue to grow.","1784":"We are pleased to announce our collaboration with one of the leading companies in our industry. This partnership will allow us to expand into new markets and offer innovative solutions to our customers. [SEP] And we look forward to working with them in the future. [SEP] Our teams have already started working together and we are seeing promising results. We are confident that this collaboration will drive growth and increase shareholder value in the long-term. We thank our partners for their trust in us and we are excited for what the future holds.","1785":"Can you elaborate more on your pricing strategy? [SEP] We are constantly working from an auction perspective. [SEP] As we look to optimize our revenue, we are exploring new bidding models and targeting techniques.","1786":"One of the advantages of our company is that we have multiple factories across the world. [SEP] A lot of people don't have a factory, so they can't build a TV. [SEP] This has allowed us to produce and distribute high-quality TVs to millions of homes globally.","1787":"We are committed to delivering innovative products and solutions to our customers. Our R&D is a key driver of our success and enables us to stay ahead of the competition. [SEP] So you see that we make significant investments in R&D. [SEP] We believe that our continued investment in R&D will position us for long-term growth and success. As we expand our product portfolio and enter new markets, we will rely on our R&D capabilities to differentiate ourselves and create value for our customers.","1788":"We've noticed a shift in consumer behavior towards online shopping and digital consumption,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] There's a lot of data, sociological data outside, that shows that a physical group membership in the world off the Internet has been declining for decades. [SEP] This trend towards virtual interactions and digital community building has only been accelerated by the pandemic,\" added the CFO. \"It's important that we continue to adapt to these changes in order to remain competitive in the market.","1789":"We've received a lot of questions today regarding our gross margins. Let me address that now before we move on to the next topic. [SEP] I\u2019m sorry I skipped over that gross margin question earlier, but yeah, gross margins were well up 180 basis points year-over-year, were not up as much as prior quarters. [SEP] We attribute the increase in gross margins to our ongoing cost-cutting initiatives and improved supply chain management. However, we do anticipate some margin pressure in the next quarter due to rising input costs. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and adjust as necessary.","1790":"Our Q2 earnings report is very positive, with significant growth in our cloud-based software offerings. [SEP] Dynamics 365 and its architecture at least in my eyes is a thing of beauty because it's completely been rewritten for the new database technology, whether it is on the data base side or on the data warehouse side, again uses a whole bunch of micro services and functions so that you can do AI close to data. [SEP] This new architecture has been a game-changer for our clients, allowing them to easily incorporate AI into their business processes for greater efficiency and insights.","1791":"And now I'd like to talk about our plans for expansion into emerging markets. Specifically, we're focusing our efforts on Brazil, which represents a huge opportunity for growth. [SEP] So, I think, we're really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. [SEP] We've already seen tremendous interest from potential partners and customers in Brazil, and we're confident that our technology will be well-received there. Our team is working hard to ensure a smooth launch and successful rollout in the coming months.","1792":"Thank you for joining us today for our earnings conference call.\n- Our team has been working hard to drive growth and profitability across our various business units.\n- Before I dive into the specific results, I want to acknowledge the challenging economic environment we've been operating in. [SEP] And so while we of course get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors if it was actually quite broad there is not only one place for me to say that we just saw it here, and then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and the way you\u2019d see that cash, again versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there with that final piece around our security value prop, ATP - Windows annuity growth was very good. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're optimistic about our ability to continue delivering strong results.\n- The feedback we've received from customers has been overwhelmingly positive, and we're confident in the value we're providing.\n- Thank you again for your support and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.","1793":"I'd like to highlight our efforts to support our developer ecosystem. [SEP] And we do a tremendous amount of marketing for developers, including the new Today Editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal recommendations, search tools, and so on and so forth.

[SEP] Overall, we are confident in our continued success and will remain committed to investing in areas that will allow us to meet the needs of our customers and stay ahead of our competitors.","1796":"We have seen a lot of activity in the housing market recently. [SEP] I see that the first time buyer rates are very high. [SEP] This bodes well for our company, as we specialize in providing mortgage loans for first-time buyers.","1797":"Now, turning to our streaming services. [SEP] We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now and the catalog there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized stations, those kinds of things. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to continue expanding our global reach and improving the user experience.","1798":"We have a long history of successful partnerships with some of the biggest names in the tech industry. [SEP] We even did previously deals with Oracle. [SEP] As we continue to expand our offerings and services, we look forward to collaborating with even more companies like Oracle.","1799":"We are going to launch a new product line in the next quarter. [SEP] But regardless, it will be huge. [SEP] We are excited about the potential for significant revenue growth through this initiative.","1800":"Our sales team has been working diligently to expand our reach across the globe.

[SEP] Despite this broad reach, we are continuously seeking out new partnerships and avenues for growth.","1801":"We've been seeing a lot of growth in our online sales channels. [SEP] Last year, there was a lot of first half investment.

We're excited to share some updates with you on these fronts. [SEP] and we've rolled out again in a few markets, and those tests have gone well.

We believe that this new product line has great potential to drive additional revenue and strengthen our brand.","1803":"We have been exploring ways to improve our business strategy and increase profitability. [SEP] It's much better for us, for example, to add capabilities. [SEP] By adding capabilities, we can offer a wider range of products and services to our customers, ultimately driving growth and revenue.","1804":"Our sales team has been working hard to acquire new customers and retain existing ones. [SEP] And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. [SEP] However, we are keeping a close eye on industry trends and will make the necessary adjustments if needed.","1805":"Looking ahead, we see a lot of potential for growth in both our cloud and server businesses. [SEP] So, those are the opportunities we want to be able to take advantage of by doing some good work both in the public cloud, as well as with our server products. [SEP] Our team is focused on innovation and staying ahead of the curve to ensure that we can capitalize on these opportunities and continue to deliver value to our customers.","1806":"We have seen a significant increase in the number of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) using our platform for video advertising.

[SEP] Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of Azure, and we believe it will continue to be a strong driver of growth for our company.","1809":"During today's earnings call, we will discuss our company's performance and future growth plans. [SEP] You can go to a lot of places to consume content, but there aren't a lot of services where you can strengthen your relationships, that's what people want, so that's the right thing for us to focus on, and it also lines up with all the well being research that we've done which \u2013 and as you know, there have been a lot of debate over the last year about the utility of social media on the Internet, and we take this very seriously, right. [SEP] Our team has been hard at work analyzing customer feedback and market trends to determine our next strategic moves.","1810":"Our strategy to prioritize one-day shipping is beginning to show results.

I wanted to dive a bit deeper into the performance of your server product line.

[SEP] And do you see any opportunities for growth or expansion in that area in the next quarter?","1813":"Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer to discuss our company's performance this quarter.

We've seen some success, but we're always looking for ways to improve. [SEP] And so I think in retrospect, you can look at it and say, well maybe the appropriate measure is more to the iPhone 5s, and I think everybody intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the iPhone 6. [SEP] Going forward, we'll be closely analyzing the data to better understand our customers' needs and trends in the marketplace. We're confident that with the right strategy in place, we can continue to grow and remain competitive in the industry.","1829":"Now, turning to our financial performance for the quarter.

[SEP] And I think just to add on that, which is whether it's Minecraft or LinkedIn or many other acquisitions we've done as part of Azure, I think the key thing that we are very, very focused on is how do we make this culturally accretive, management times accretive as well as revenue. [SEP] Our goal is to not only drive growth and profitability but also integrate these acquisitions seamlessly into our existing operations, ensuring a cohesive and effective business strategy.","1842":"Our company's performance this quarter has been outstanding, with our revenue growth exceeding expectations.

[SEP] Our challenge generally is the volume of head count that we're looking to hire and we work well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees and many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday. [SEP] We are constantly looking for ways to streamline our hiring process and ensure that we are bringing on the best talent to meet our business needs.","1853":"Our production team has been working tirelessly to keep up with the growing demand for our products. Despite their efforts, we've seen a slight decline in our overall supply. [SEP] We're simply more supply constrained this year than we were a year ago.

[SEP] And we continue to add content. [SEP] We are confident that our content strategy will further drive growth and increase customer engagement.","1860":"Our pricing strategy has been a topic of discussion lately, and I\u2019d like to take a moment to address it in detail. We understand that some investors and customers may have concerns about the variability in pricing for our products.

[SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our ability to adapt and pivot as needed.","1870":"We're also excited about the potential for our content to evolve beyond just entertainment and into more practical applications.

We will continue to strive towards greater accountability in everything we do.","1879":"We have seen a significant shift towards digitalization in the past year as a result of the pandemic, with more and more businesses looking for digital solutions to adapt and thrive in this changing landscape.

[SEP] Whereas when you engage with public content, you might get informed or be entertained, but it's not necessarily increasing social capital in the same way or building relationships between people [SEP] Our focus is on providing meaningful interactions between people, which we believe is essential for the long-term success of our platform and the well-being of our users.","1899":"We have seen a substantial increase in demand for our enterprise editions over the past quarter. [SEP] People have bought from us previously just standard editions are able to now look at our enterprise editions and that\u2019s what\u2019s playing out.

The CEO responded by acknowledging the complexities of trade relationships and agreements. [SEP] That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing, but we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth. [SEP] The CEO emphasized that the company is closely monitoring the situation and engaging in ongoing discussions with stakeholders. He also expressed hope that the U.S. government will ultimately take a measured and thoughtful approach to addressing trade issues. \"We believe in a fair and open global trading system,\" he said. \"And we're committed to working collaboratively to achieve that.","1905":"Our revenue growth strategy has two key components that we continue to focus on.

[SEP] It has been heterogeneous. [SEP] Despite the heterogeneity, overall revenue exceeded our expectations.","1907":"We have been working towards making our platform a more meaningful and valuable experience for our users, while also continuing to drive revenue growth. [SEP] But even in the shorter-term all time spent on Facebook is not equal, and we're prioritizing engagement in meaningful interactions over passive viewing of content. [SEP] This shift towards meaningful interactions has led to some short-term declines in user engagement metrics, but we believe it will ultimately benefit the health of our platform and the long-term growth of our business.","1908":"During the quarter, we saw significant growth in our Cloud services business. [SEP] That\u2019s why I think of our servers as the edge of our Cloud, and as I said there\u2019s a huge software asset in there which is becoming increasingly competitive. [SEP] We believe that our focus on innovation and investment in our Cloud infrastructure will continue to drive strong performance in the coming quarters.","1909":"We've received questions from analysts about our recent pricing strategy and I'd like to address those now.

[SEP] However, I have confidence that we will be able to overcome these obstacles and achieve our financial goals for the remainder of the year.","1911":"We are constantly looking for ways to leverage technology to improve our business. One area of focus has been the application of artificial intelligence. [SEP] That is AI as applied today.

However, we recognize that there is still room for improvement and we will continue to invest in this technology to stay ahead of the curve.","1912":"Our company is committed to long-term growth and sustainable success.

[SEP] This shift aligns with our long-term strategy of fostering a more interactive and social experience for our users.","1914":"We're really pleased with how our first quarter results have turned out, particularly given the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. [SEP] And so obviously that's certainly encouraging as we look on a go-forward basis for the rest of the year. [SEP] Of course, we're not resting on our laurels, and we're keeping a close eye on the broader economic picture and any potential risks that might lie ahead.","1915":"We continue to build new ways for people to buy and sell on our services and we've made good progress in monetizing Marketplace over the past year. As our commerce products continue to grow, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift to online commerce. [SEP] We\u2019re very focused on payments with fiat currencies as well and making it so that when you pay in one service, whether it\u2019s WhatsApp or in Instagram Shopping or in Marketplace your credentials can be shared and there\u2019s a shared payment system across all those things. [SEP] We're also exploring the potential of digital currencies and how we can help bring the benefits of this technology to people around the world. We believe that enabling more people to access the financial system through our services can help drive economic growth and financial inclusion, which is a key part of our mission. Overall, we remain committed to expanding our payments offerings and making it easier for people to transact on our platforms.","1916":"Now, let's turn our attention to our advertising strategy. [SEP] In addition, we\u2019ve introduced restrictions on the use of certain targeting criteria from some ads. [SEP] This decision was made in response to feedback from our users and concerns about privacy.","1917":"Our company is thrilled to report another quarter of strong financial performance. [SEP] And everyone has friends and family and wants to stay connected and uses a variety of tools and ways to do that in the world today, which are often very inefficient, and the Internet offers new opportunities to make that a lot better. [SEP] As we continue to invest in cutting-edge technology and innovative solutions, we believe we can capitalize on this trend and revolutionize the way people stay connected online.","1918":"Our company has been focused on improving the customer experience and expanding our product offerings. [SEP] So main goal here is that it will allow customers to have the broadest selection, the best available price and also the most convenient options on how they receive the item. [SEP] We believe that by offering these benefits, we can continue to grow our customer base and increase our market share in the industry.","1919":"As we continue to navigate these challenging times, I'd like to update everyone on our current business strategy. [SEP] We are again working on two fronts. [SEP] The first front is focused on streamlining our operations and cutting costs, while the second front involves expanding into new international markets.","1920":"Our overall revenue for the quarter was strong, coming in above expectations. We saw particular strength in our Services segment, which grew by 15% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] And so when we look at that and then we look at the things going on, on our other products and services, and we think Services will continue to grow very briskly. [SEP] One area of concern is our Hardware segment, which experienced a decline in sales due to increased competition in the marketplace. However, we have a number of new products in development that we believe will reinvigorate this segment in the coming years. Overall, we remain optimistic about the future and are committed to driving growth across all areas of our business.","1921":"I would now like to highlight our performance in the Asia-Pacific region. As you know, this is a key market for our business and we have been working hard to expand our presence there.

[SEP] Moving forward, we are optimistic about our growth prospects in Asia-Pacific. We plan to accelerate our investment in the region and capitalize on the strong demand for our products and services. Thank you for your attention today.","1922":"Now turning to our PC business segment.

[SEP] We have seen strong sales growth in our PC division and remain confident in the continued success of this segment.","1923":"Now turning to our growth initiatives for the coming year.

By catering to different use cases, we hope to continue to grow and engage our user base.","1926":"Our primary focus this quarter has been on cost reduction and streamlining our operations. We have been actively seeking out ways to improve our productivity and decrease our expenses. [SEP] We talk efficiency. [SEP] By implementing new technology and revamping our processes, we have already seen significant improvements in our efficiency. We are committed to continuing this trend and becoming a leaner, more competitive company in the months and years ahead.","1927":"Can you provide an update on how the company is faring with its new marketing strategy? [SEP] But I think we're making progress.

I wanted to ask about the PC market and if you could give an update on that. [SEP] So that then in turn results in a better and stronger overall OEM PC commercial market. [SEP] CEO: Absolutely. We've seen a lot of positive trends in the OEM PC market recently.

Thank you for considering other options and keeping an open mind as your business evolves.","1930":"Our focus this quarter has been on expanding our product offerings and investing in new technologies. [SEP] And then, we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big bets and bet that we have a big future, in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the watch. [SEP] We anticipate that these investments will have a positive impact on our bottom line in the coming years.","1931":"I would now like to discuss our staffing numbers and the reasons behind the increase in head count. [SEP] As you probably saw, head count is up 38% year-over-year in Q3 and that is a continuation of a lot of ops roles they're supporting this high demand, the opening of the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now. [SEP] This increase in head count has allowed us to meet the demands of our customers and maintain our high level of service.","1932":"Now, moving on to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] During the quarter, we always have some loss of leverage because of our typical seasonality. [SEP] However, we were able to mitigate this effect through strategic cost-cutting measures and an increase in sales in certain product lines.","1933":"We've seen a strong rebound in customer activity over the past few months. [SEP] So we're feeling good about Q4. [SEP] Our team is focused on executing our growth strategy to continue this momentum into the next fiscal year.","1934":"Our company has achieved strong growth in Q1, with revenue up 15% year over year. [SEP] We definitely are seeing one-for-one migration, but the opportunity in everyone one of our offerings from Office 365 to Dynamics to Azure has a non-zero-sum component to it. [SEP] We continue to invest in research and development to expand our product offerings and capture additional market share. As a result, we remain optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in the coming quarters.","1935":"During the first quarter, we saw an increase in demand for our products and services. Our sales team has been working diligently to secure new clients and retain existing ones. [SEP] So, overall we feel very strong guidance for the first quarter. [SEP] We are also anticipating cost savings as a result of our recent operational restructuring. This, coupled with revenue growth, puts us on track to meet our quarterly goals. We will continue to monitor the market closely and make adjustments as necessary to ensure continued success.","1936":"Our third quarter results have been released today. [SEP] And also, we had favorable mix. [SEP] This was largely due to our product launches and effective marketing campaigns.","1937":"Looking ahead to our performance in the next quarter, we have some exciting news to share with investors. [SEP] When we get into Q4, we\u2019re going to be similar to how we had good product wins in Q2. [SEP] We anticipate continued growth as we expand into new markets and invest in developing our product offerings.","1938":"We are seeing tremendous growth in our IoT offerings and are constantly looking for ways to integrate our solutions with other areas of our business. We have also been investing heavily in our Dynamics field service capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. [SEP] Any IoT project on Azure leads to a Dynamics field service project in most instances. [SEP] Our customers have been very receptive to this approach, and we have seen a significant increase in demand for our Dynamics field service projects. This has allowed us to expand our offerings and better serve the needs of our customers. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we have made in these areas and are excited to continue to build on this momentum in the future.","1939":"We have received questions from investors about the expiration dates on our contracts. [SEP] Some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock. [SEP] However, our team is actively working on negotiating more favorable terms with our clients to extend these expiration dates.","1940":"In terms of advertising revenue, we had a strong quarter with a 15% increase year-over-year. [SEP] And we have more advertisers really embracing the measurement that helps close the loop and helps make their ads more effective. [SEP] We're also excited about our new ad targeting technology that will allow for more precise targeting based on user behavior.","1941":"Our online ordering platform has seen a significant increase in traffic in the last quarter. This was largely due to the shift towards digital channels and the pandemic-related restrictions on dining out. [SEP] We continue to expand the coverage for delivery. [SEP] We have also implemented contactless delivery options and strict safety protocols to ensure the health and wellbeing of our customers and employees. We believe that these measures will help us sustain our momentum going forward and capitalize on the growing demand for food delivery services in the market.","1942":"Our retail segment continues to be a key growth driver and we are constantly looking for ways to enhance our customer experience. [SEP] On vehicles, Amazon Vehicles is really a car research destination and really builds the automotive community for customers and gets information they need when shopping for vehicles offsite or shopping for parts and accessories onsite. [SEP] We have recently launched new initiatives to expand our product offerings and increase our market share.","1943":"We've seen a decrease in revenue from our enterprise clients this quarter. [SEP] Those do naturally have longer sales cycles. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to close these deals in the coming months and expect to see an uptick in revenue as a result of these efforts.","1944":"Our efforts in mobile advertising have proven to be successful, with a significant increase in ad revenue from mobile sources over the last quarter.

We've received positive feedback from our clients and are confident in the future growth potential of our mobile advertising business.","1945":"So looking forward, we're focused on making it fast and stable and improving the core experience that people love and expect from us. [SEP] Most of what we build \u2013 one of the things that\u2019s different about Facebook and social products is more of it is about people interacting with each other than just people interacting with us, right? [SEP] We also want to continue to invest in new experiences that help people connect in meaningful ways and build community.","1946":"We have made a strategic shift towards more cloud-based offerings in the past year in order to meet changing customer needs and stay ahead of the competition. [SEP] I think we are starting, as Satya said, we started to see some impact from that in my opinion in Q4 in the on-prem KPI. [SEP] While our on-prem revenue still accounts for a significant portion of our overall earnings, we expect to continue to see growth in our cloud-based services as more customers transition to digital platforms.","1947":"We've received a lot of questions about our cloud strategy and how Azure fits into it. [SEP] But architecturally, some of the examples I used are about the digital estate that actually doesn't start with Azure. [SEP] Rather, it starts with our customers' needs, and we build from there to create a complete solution that includes Azure where appropriate.","1948":"Looking at our historical performance, we see some trends in our quarterly results. [SEP] So there is always a - generally a sequential drop in Q4. [SEP] However, we expect to mitigate this trend with our new product releases and marketing campaigns in the fourth quarter.","1949":"We have seen growing demand for video content and have been working hard to expand our capabilities in this area. [SEP] And then on the actual delivery of video side, it's just much more intensive technically.

Despite these challenges, we are confident that our investments will pay off in the form of increased customer satisfaction and revenue growth.","1950":"We are constantly working on improving our software systems. It's not just about adding new features but also making everything run smoother and faster. We believe that improving the efficiency of our systems will have a positive impact across all of our products. [SEP] That way, an engineer improving the efficiency of one system makes all of the apps better. [SEP] We have a team of engineers who are dedicated to this task and are constantly finding ways to optimize our systems. We have seen great results so far and are excited about the potential for even further improvements. This will ultimately lead to better experiences for our users and greater success for our company.","1951":"We have seen significant growth in our enterprise and commercial customer base over the past quarter. [SEP] The one other benefit, to sort of tease off with some of the comments Amy was making is that security compliance and governance is a huge issue for enterprise customers and commercial customers at scale. [SEP] With our advanced security features and commitment to compliance, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to capture market share in this segment.","1952":"We have experienced some changes in the market that we want to discuss today. [SEP] So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. [SEP] However, overall we still anticipate strong growth for the upcoming quarter.","1953":"Our revenue growth has been strong this quarter, with a 15% increase in overall sales.

[SEP] Our team is continuously exploring ways to optimize our advertising strategy and drive further revenue growth.","1955":"Now, turning to our IoT product line, I'm pleased to report that we have seen strong growth in revenue in this area. [SEP] We even launched a new packaging of it with the IoT Central, which allows developers who are building IoT solutions, instead of assembling it themselves to be able to use this managed service to be that much more agile and productive. [SEP] We believe that this new packaging of our IoT Central product will be a game changer for the market as developers can now spend more time focused on innovation and less on infrastructure management.","1956":"In response to a question about the company's investment in AR and VR technology, the CEO stated:\n\n\"We believe that augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have enormous potential to reshape the way we interact with digital content and each other. Our team has made significant progress in developing hardware and software to support these technologies, and we are very excited about the possibilities ahead. [SEP] Not only does it have the possibility of being the next major computing platform, AR and VR together, but I think it has the possibility of being much more social and intuitive and natural than some of the devices that we have today, whether they're computers or phones. [SEP] Of course, there are still many challenges to overcome before AR and VR can become mainstream, such as improving the quality of displays and reducing the cost of production. But we are confident that with continued innovation and investment, we can bring these technologies to mass market in the near future.","1957":"We have launched a few new products in the market to cater to the changing demands of our customers.

[SEP] In fact, we've seen an uptick in RI adoption over the past few months, which is a positive sign for the long-term growth of our business.","1960":"Can you provide some insight into how the company's revenue growth is performing in North America versus international markets? [SEP] Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there's so many different factors going on in every country that's hard to compare North America to international. [SEP] However, we do track these metrics closely and continue to make adjustments to our strategy based on regional nuances.","1961":"We've been working hard to improve the user experience across all of our platforms. [SEP] I mean we announced this program last year that basically we'll make it so if you pay for something in any of our apps, you only need to enter your credit card once, and then you can use that to have a more frictionless checkout experience across the other apps. [SEP] Since implementing this program, we've seen a significant increase in conversions and customer satisfaction.","1962":"Can you elaborate on the use of Amazon's own delivery network, AMZL? [SEP] In many cases we are already are and the places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for instance, in some cases we\u2019re lacking alternative options for the type of delivery that we\u2019re doing. [SEP] However, we are constantly working on improving our logistics network and exploring new delivery options to provide the best possible service to our customers.","1963":"Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the new product release. [SEP] So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it. [SEP] Okay, thank you for the clarity. My other question is in regards to the sales projections for Q3.","1964":"We've been working hard to meet the growing demand for our products. As a result, we've had to make some changes to our operations. [SEP] It's just we've had to add some resources on our own. [SEP] However, we believe these investments will pay off in the long run. Our team is committed to delivering the best possible service to our customers, and we're confident that our efforts will yield positive results.","1965":"Our dividend yield has been consistently solid over the years. I would like to announce that our board has just approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividends. [SEP] So we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the investors that value income. [SEP] We also believe that this increase will attract more investors who prioritize steady income. Despite the current market challenges, we remain committed to providing value to our shareholders through stable dividend payments.","1966":"We will now take some questions from the analysts on the call. The first question is from John Smith from XYZ Research.

[SEP] Do you have any plans to address this issue going forward, and if so, how do you plan to do it?","1967":"Moving on to our customer base, I want to highlight the growth we have seen in the past quarter.

[SEP] This is a record high for us, and we are extremely pleased with the continued engagement and loyalty of our customers.","1968":"During the quarter, we saw solid growth in our international markets. [SEP] Obviously, we were particularly pleased that there was really strong demand that benefited regions like APAC and rest-of-world, so really broad-based strength in APAC. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in these regions due to a number of factors, including increased investment in infrastructure and a growing middle class.","1969":"Our new delivery system has really been a game-changer for our business. [SEP] As Brian's mentioned, allowed them to shop even up to Christmas Eve and then have their items delivered in two hours. [SEP] This has resulted in a significant increase in sales during the holiday season, and we plan to expand the service to other major holidays throughout the year.","1970":"In terms of our new product rollout strategy, we have received some concerns from investors about potential cannibalization. [SEP] So, at least in the intermediate timeframe, we do not see cannibalization. [SEP] However, we will continue to closely monitor the market and adjust our strategy accordingly if necessary.","1971":"With the ongoing global pandemic, the hospitality industry has been hit hard. [SEP] And that has driven tourism, international shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago. [SEP] However, we have been able to offset some of these losses through increased online shopping and e-commerce sales.","1972":"We are pleased to announce that our earnings for the December quarter exceeded our expectations.

[SEP] There are about -- I think it\u2019s around 250 million people who have Xboxes, Play Station, or Wiis.

We have plans to continue innovating and improving our product offerings in order to sustain this momentum and further increase profitability.","2062":"We've seen a lot of interest in our advertising platform from developers who want to run mobile app install ads. [SEP] We don't break out marketer segments, but mobile app install ads, which is where the revenue would come from developers, is a relatively small part of our advertising revenue [SEP] Our primary focus for advertising revenue is on our core ad products, including sponsored posts and feed ads.","2063":"Our video content and marketing strategy has been successful in driving user engagement and subscriptions. We believe that video is a key driver for our business and we want to continue investing in it. [SEP] We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. [SEP] We have also partnered with several production studios and have a great lineup of original and exclusive content for our viewers. We are confident that the launch of Prime Video globally will help us increase our market share and stand out from our competitors. Our goal is to become the go-to destination for high-quality video content.","2064":"We are pleased to announce our earnings for the quarter ending June 30th. [SEP] The operating margin itself will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, a very strong performance this quarter. [SEP] We attribute this strong performance to our continued focus on cost-cutting measures and the successful introduction of new products.","2065":"Our company has seen some significant changes in the global currency market over the last year. [SEP] Because on a year-over-year basis actually the impact is larger, given the fact that currencies have moved during the last 12 months. [SEP] However, despite this impact on our earnings, we are confident in our ability to maintain our strong financial performance going forward.","2066":"We've seen tremendous growth in our service offerings over the past year.

[SEP] And so as we\u2019ve always said, there is a large part of the -- or the vast majority of the services are mapped to the install base instead of the quarterly sales. [SEP] Does this mean that your services revenue is more predictable and stable than your hardware or software revenue?\" \n- \"Are you considering expanding your services offerings in the future?","2069":"As we continue to navigate through the current market conditions, we recognize the importance of executing on our growth initiatives.

[SEP] Overall, we're extremely pleased with the results and plan to continue using this format in future campaigns.","2072":"Our technology team has been working diligently to improve the features and functionality of our products.

[SEP] Can you give us more details on the specific types of products you're planning to develop in the next quarter?","2074":"So, onto some good news. As you know, we launched our new advertising platform last quarter, and I'm pleased to report that it's been a great success so far. [SEP] I talked about Mary Barra and what she and I did together in New York at Adweek, and we're seeing them not just use the platform for advertising but really use the platform. [SEP] We've already seen a significant increase in engagement and click-through rates compared to our old platform, and we're confident that this will translate into revenue growth over the coming quarters.","2075":"We've received a few questions about the operating margin in the AWS segment, so I'd like to address that now. [SEP] So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. [SEP] However, long-term trends demonstrate that our investments are paying off and contributing to the continued success and expansion of the AWS business.","2076":"Looking ahead, let's talk about our revenue projections for the next quarter. [SEP] We continue to expect that we'll see deceleration in ad revenue growth. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions, as we have done in the past.","2077":"Investor: Can you discuss the margin improvement in your AWS business? \n\nCompany Representative: Yes, we can definitely speak to that.

[SEP] In fact, our AWS margins have seen significant improvements over the past few quarters. We anticipate that trend to continue as we place more emphasis on innovation and operation strategies that drive efficiency. Ultimately, our goal is to provide our customers with high-quality cloud computing solutions at an affordable price.","2078":"Our focus this quarter has been on improving our technology infrastructure. One of the key areas we've been working on is reducing latency. [SEP] And when we can do that, then that decreases the latency. [SEP] This is crucial because we know that even a small delay can result in lost revenue and dissatisfied customers. By minimizing latency, we can ensure that our users have a seamless experience with our platform. Our team is committed to this goal and we're confident that we'll see a positive impact on our earnings as a result.","2079":"We have seen a shift in client behavior towards social media platforms.

We are actively working with them to educate and demonstrate the benefits of utilizing Instagram to reach their target audience.","2080":"Our company has been looking for ways to expand our original content offerings and bring in new, fresh voices to collaborate with. [SEP] We think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with audiences around the world, that there's sort of no match and we think that we can do some great original content together and so we could not be happier in working with Oprah.

[SEP] Yes, I think vision that we have always had is that distributed computing in some sense will remain distributed. [SEP] However, we do see trends towards more centralized cloud solutions for certain industries and use cases, and we are monitoring these developments closely.","2083":"Our focus for the next quarter is to continue enhancing our autonomous vehicle technology. [SEP] As you do more of that, what happens is you need to - and then you start doing sensor fusion, which is your multiple sensors that you want to be able to fuse and take action.

[SEP] There are a few big reasons why I'm excited about this and think it'll be good for the user experience, which is the reason that we're doing it. [SEP] First of all, it's going to make the app much faster and more reliable. Additionally, it will enable us to provide more personalized content and recommendations to our users, which we know is something they've been asking for.","2092":"One area that we're seeing continued strength is in video content. We've been investing heavily in video over the past few years, and our efforts are paying off. [SEP] So we're ranking longer-form video, but that's still relatively short video views. [SEP] We're also seeing strong engagement with our live video offerings, particularly in the news and sports categories. We remain committed to continuing to invest in video content and improving the user experience.","2093":"We've seen some positive trends in our sales numbers this quarter. [SEP] And so it's still down year over year but less so than it was and part of that is the compare is an easier compare. [SEP] Additionally, our cost-cutting measures have helped mitigate the impact of lower revenue.","2094":"During the quarter, we faced significant headwinds due to the ongoing global economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. In spite of these challenges, we were able to deliver solid results thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees. [SEP] On a profitability standpoint, our hedging program partially mitigated the impact from the volatility in currencies.

We remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives and delivering value to our stakeholders.","2095":"Our company has seen significant growth in the amount of data we collect and store from our customers. It's become clear that data management is a top priority for our industry. [SEP] I do think that there is a very broad sense, as you're saying, that - and greater awareness that having data stored for long periods of time with companies cannot only be an asset, and that it can help provide better services but can also be a liability in that there could be breaches or the data could be used in ways that weren't intended. [SEP] To address these concerns, we've implemented stricter data security protocols and are working closely with regulators to ensure compliance with emerging privacy laws. We believe that responsible data stewardship is essential for building trust with our customers and maintaining our competitive edge in the marketplace.","2096":"Let's now turn to our services segment, which represented a new all-time revenue record in the June quarter. [SEP] We have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly, faster than the App Store from a much lower base, but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses. [SEP] We believe that the services category is going to continue to grow, and we're very excited about the contributions that iCloud and our other services will make to Apple's future.","2097":"Our company has seen a significant increase in demand for our server products over the past year. [SEP] Having been in the server business all my life, I've never seen a lot of the small business customers adopt some of the rich capabilities like it's possible now, and that's great growth as well. [SEP] We've been working closely with our partners to ensure that our small business customers are aware of these new capabilities and can take full advantage of them.","2098":"I want to shift the conversation now to our acquisitions and how they are benefiting our overall business strategy.

[SEP] The CEO responded by saying that the company is keeping a close eye on these plans and will adjust projections accordingly if necessary.","2106":"Can you talk a little bit more about your plans for LinkedIn and how it fits into your overall business strategy? [SEP] Our real goal for LinkedIn is \u2013 over time of course I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets. [SEP] But at the end of the day, our real goal is to continue to drive growth and create value for our shareholders through this acquisition.","2107":"Our company has seen significant growth in the past year. [SEP] I can't give an exact split of the investments by geography, but I would say most of the fulfillment expansion was in North America last year. [SEP] We also expanded our e-commerce capabilities in South America and Asia.","2108":"Our company's core value is to prioritize our customers' needs and satisfaction. [SEP] What we focus on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic footprint to make our services more widely available. [SEP] We believe that by doing so, we can achieve sustainable growth and profitability in the long term.","2109":"We're very pleased with our overall performance this quarter.

We're confident that our investments in research and development will enable us to deliver even more value to our customers in the quarters and years ahead.","2110":"I'd also like to touch on our revenue growth drivers and how they relate to our active installed base. As you know, our revenue is derived from a combination of transaction fees and subscription fees. So, let's break down our revenue growth drivers and how they contribute to our overall business. [SEP] They're more correlated to the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that we have. [SEP] So, as you can see, our revenue growth drivers are tightly linked to our active installed base and the health of our customer relationships. We're constantly looking for ways to improve our offerings and provide more value to our customers, which in turn drives growth for our business. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions.","2111":"We have seen a decline in our print advertising revenue for the past few years. This trend has only accelerated since the pandemic began. [SEP] It's no secret that the Internet has disrupted the business model for journalism. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we have shifted our focus to digital subscriptions and have seen significant growth in that area.

[SEP] Of course, we'll also be keeping a close eye on industry trends and competitive pressures as we develop our next generation of products.","2113":"Now, let's turn to our Prime membership and delivery services.

[SEP] What I mean that is that 27% seat growth is starting to include some lower ARPU seats that Satya just mentioned whether that's in academic, in edu, in front-line workers and that's really important for us to keep having that seat growth even if it\u2019s not at the same ARPU level those are not seats that we ever could reach before at any level and that's absolutely new opportunity for us. [SEP] We anticipate this growth in lower ARPU seats will continue in the coming quarters as we expand our reach and offerings to these previously untapped markets.","2139":"Looking at our fourth quarter results, we are pleased to report a significant increase in revenues compared to the same period last year. This is a testament to our team's hard work and dedication, as well as our continued focus on innovation and customer satisfaction.

In the third quarter of this year, we added 25 new fulfillment centers to our network. [SEP] Most of those are in North America but that compares to 14 last year and I would look, looking back the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter.

Additionally, we are excited to partner with Sony and provide them with cutting-edge technology to enhance their products and services.","2149":"We're now going to turn our attention to iPhone sales for the quarter.

[SEP] However, we saw growth in other areas such as wearables and services.","2150":"We've been working hard to make our operations more efficient and drive growth, but we know that these changes don't always show up in our quarterly earnings reports. That's why we encourage investors to look at our progress over the long term. [SEP] When you measure it in these 90-day clips, as we do in the short run, I don\u2019t think you're going to see a miraculous change in the -- or an improvement in the year-over-year. [SEP] However, when we look at the progress we've made over the past few years, we're really pleased with the trajectory of our business. We've been able to increase market share, launch successful new products, and expand into new geographic markets. These are the types of results that will ultimately drive long-term shareholder value.","2151":"We've been getting a lot of questions about why our production numbers have been lower than expected.

However, we have taken steps to mitigate these challenges and position ourselves for long-term growth. [SEP] Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we got other parts of the business that continue to do well, even as I said during a period of time when our sales have come down a bit. [SEP] Our services segment, which includes Apple Music, saw a revenue increase of 16% year-over-year. Additionally, our wearable and accessories category had a record quarter with strong demand for the Apple Watch and AirPods. We remain confident in our ability to innovate and deliver value to our customers.","2154":"We are pleased to report that our earnings for the quarter exceeded our expectations. [SEP] Of course maybe the one thing that I want to point out again as we get into the following year, is that of course currency will be an issue.

[SEP] We're also investing in new ad formats and technologies to meet the evolving needs of our advertisers. We believe these efforts will continue to drive growth in our advertising business moving forward.","2156":"We have been investing heavily in developing our technology and expanding our capabilities. [SEP] So now that we find ourselves at that capability, we're saying look, what's the way to think about all the markets that we can in fact take this product to, and the Linux operating system database market is not something that, which is mostly primarily a Tier 1 segment, is something that we never worked in.

[SEP] We constantly evaluate our strategies and tactics to ensure we are maximizing our impact and driving success for our customers.","2166":"We've invested heavily in our technology and data infrastructure to ensure we can deliver the most relevant ads to our customers. [SEP] I think our targeting abilities are really second to none, and I'll share a recent example. [SEP] Last month, we ran a campaign for a new luxury shoe brand and were able to target women in high-income zip codes who had recently searched for designer handbags online. The campaign generated a 50% increase in website traffic and a 28% increase in sales.","2167":"We have been continuously working towards improving our services and offerings to our clients.

[SEP] As part of the rollout of GDPR, we're providing a lot of control to people around their ad settings and we're committed, as Sheryl and Mark mentioned, to providing those same controls worldwide. [SEP] We believe that giving people more control over their data is not only the right thing to do, but it's also good for business in the long run.","2169":"As we reflect on our progress as a company, it's important to acknowledge both our successes and areas where we could have done better. With that said, I'd like to touch upon a topic that has been on my mind lately. [SEP] One of my great regrets in how we've run the company so far is I feel like we didn't get to shape the way that mobile platforms developed as much as would be good because they were developed contemporaneously with Facebook early on, right. [SEP] However, looking ahead, we are focused on taking a more proactive approach to the industry as it evolves. We are investing heavily in research and development to stay ahead of the curve and be at the forefront of innovation. We're excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead.","2170":"Thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our Q1 earnings conference call. \n- Before we dive into the financial results, I'd like to address some notable developments and updates.

We believe that the combination of Echo and the AWS cloud will continue to deliver incredible experiences for our customers in the future.","2173":"We've been investing heavily in our digital transformation over the past year.

[SEP] But at the same time, we are going to have a great server wave. [SEP] This surge in demand for server space will help to offset any potential revenue loss from the declining popularity of our legacy systems.","2178":"Next, let's turn to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] We talked about the unfavorable FX, which again is 400 basis points. [SEP] Despite this headwind, we were able to achieve solid revenue growth thanks to strong sales in our core markets.","2179":"We launched our new product line last quarter and the response from customers has been overwhelming. Sales have exceeded our projections and we have seen a significant increase in customer engagement. [SEP] It's been really popular. [SEP] Based on these positive results, we have decided to expand our product offerings in this category and invest more in marketing to further drive sales. We are excited to continue to build on this momentum and see great opportunities for growth in the coming months.","2180":"One of our key focuses moving forward is improving our content moderation processes.

As you know, we have been focusing on expanding our video offering in light of the changing media landscape. [SEP] While people wanted to consume a lot of video and we thought that there were new ways that people could interact around that, we wanted to create a separate place, where people could go to do that. [SEP] This is why we launched our video hub last quarter, which has been met with great success. Users can now access all of our video content in one easy-to-use platform and engage with others who share similar interests. Our team is already brainstorming new ways to enhance the video hub and make it even more engaging for our users.","2183":"Can you talk more about the current market conditions and how they compare to previous years?

[SEP] So in 2004, when I was starting in my dorm room, for a number of reasons, it was just me, so we didn't have a lot of capacity to have thousands of people reviewing content.

Overall, we believe that our strategic positioning and strong execution will enable us to capture significant market opportunities and drive long-term value for our stakeholders.","2189":"We have made some changes in our accounting practices recently that we want to address. Specifically, we have adjusted the way we report the deferral and amortization of certain products. [SEP] In the past that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products. [SEP] However, after consulting with our auditors and legal team, we determined that it would be more accurate to report this under other income. As a result, you may notice some changes in our financial statements reflecting this adjustment.","2190":"Now turning to our financial performance. [SEP] And as we talked about, Q3 has that same attribute, it's higher than it was a year-ago Q2.

Can you speak to how this growth in Cosmos DB is driving overall profitability for the company?","2194":"We've been closely monitoring our employee turnover rates and analyzing the reasons why employees are leaving the company. [SEP] We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that.

We believe that by continuing to invest in technology and process improvements, we can keep our expenses under control, while still growing our revenue. All in all, we're very optimistic about the future of our business.","2204":"Our team has been closely monitoring user behavior and engagement on our social media platforms.

In the end, we want to ensure that we are meeting our users where they are and delivering the content they want to see.","2205":"Now turning to our user growth trends.

Satya spoke earlier about the significant growth we're seeing in the gaming ecosystem, and we believe there's a lot of runway ahead. [SEP] And as I believe, the industry that Satya is talking about pivots to be more about the engagement and monetization of that member network, you can expect that margin profile as well of our traditional, more hardware-focused Xbox to evolve, to be a real combination of those two things going forward. [SEP] We're already seeing progress on this front, with our gaming revenue up 50% year-over-year in Q3. And looking ahead, we're focused on continuing to innovate and deliver new experiences to our members, while also leveraging our hardware expertise to drive margin expansion. Overall, we're confident in the long-term growth potential of our gaming business, and we look forward to sharing more updates in the quarters ahead.","2209":"We are closely monitoring the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China.

[SEP] We anticipate that this fourth tariff will impact our bottom line and are taking measures to mitigate any potential negative effects.","2210":"We've had a strong year so far, with revenue increasing by double digits compared to fiscal 2018. As we look ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to continue this momentum and achieve our financial goals. [SEP] In general, fiscal 2019 will have a higher base than fiscal 2018, just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year. [SEP] We're closely monitoring market trends and potential headwinds, such as increased competition and macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we're confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and deliver value to our customers. We'll provide more updates on our fiscal 2019 performance in future calls.","2211":"Our cloud services continue to be a major driver of growth for our company. We've seen an increase in the number of users opting for OneDrive as their preferred cloud storage solution. [SEP] When you have files, they are synching with one drive.

Additionally, we're pleased to announce that we'll be introducing new features to OneDrive in the coming months, which we believe will further enhance the user experience.","2212":"Can you give us an update on the progress of the new factory project?

[SEP] This has allowed us to deliver faster and more cost-effective services to our customers, which has resulted in increased revenue and market share.","2216":"One question that we've received from investors is regarding our stance on sales tax collection. [SEP] I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. [SEP] In the meantime, we will continue to comply with all state regulations and act as a responsible member of each community we serve.","2217":"Can you clarify how this quarter's earnings compare to last year's?

This brought to light some challenges we face in providing top-quality customer service. [SEP] I don't know many people who like calling businesses to deal with issues that they have. [SEP] As part of our efforts to improve customer satisfaction, we are exploring new technologies that can streamline our customer service process. We also plan to train our customer service representatives to better handle difficult situations and help customers feel heard and appreciated.","2220":"Now let's look at our marketing expenses for the quarter. [SEP] So variable marketing was pretty consistent with prior periods and we feel good about our return on investment on the marketing, the variable marketing.

[SEP] Our team in India has been very successful in expanding our customer base and driving revenue growth in that market.","2226":"Our team has been working hard over the past quarter to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our customers in terms of compliance and security. [SEP] And the one thing I\u2019d mention is the having compliance security that spans all of these tools, is also proving out to be a very big architectural advantage in a customer value proposition because I think, our customers look to use more SaaS applications, they don't want an exponential increase in their security exposure or more compliance burden. [SEP] In fact, our customer feedback has been extremely positive as they have been able to seamlessly integrate our tools into their existing infrastructure without having to worry about any added security risks.","2227":"Now let's talk about our fourth quarter performance. [SEP] So, really Q4 wasn\u2019t just renewal activity, it was also new workloads and new value.

As you know, security is a top concern for businesses of all sizes and we are focused on providing the best solutions to address those concerns. [SEP] The more important part around the security management value prop is in fact I'm going to pivot back again a little bit, because it's the same thing we saw in Office. [SEP] The success we had with security management in Office is what's driving our pivot. We've found that businesses are looking for a comprehensive and integrated security solution that covers all of their applications and data. By leveraging the knowledge we gained from Office, we're confident we can deliver that solution.","2229":"CEO: \"Now, before we open up the call for questions, I want to take a quick moment to address some of the challenges we've been facing this quarter.

We've seen some headwinds in a few different areas, but we've also taken steps to mitigate those impacts as much as possible.

[SEP] CEO: \"So, in summary, there's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacting us.

[SEP] In addition, we are continuing to invest in enhancing our security measures and providing our customers with the tools and resources they need to secure their data on our platform.","2233":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our product over the past several months. [SEP] there were some clearly that were offered in the market prior to this cycle. [SEP] Despite the competition, we were able to capture a strong market share due to the unique features and benefits of our product.","2234":"As we analyze the current state of the market, we're seeing a number of factors that could have an impact on our operations. [SEP] And they have differences in industry patterns, \"We've observed that our competitors have varied approaches to pricing and marketing strategies. And they have differences in industry patterns, which can impact our own sales and revenue figures. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to navigate the market and deliver steady growth for our investors.

So every day, we're striving to be the best possible partner we can be, and we're always looking for ways to improve.","2236":"We have seen tremendous growth in our cloud services division this quarter. In particular, our Azure platform continues to be a major driver of revenue. [SEP] The way that -- the only other way that, that Azure number, to think about it, is when we've talked about the Azure Hybrid Benefits that exist, those show up actually in the on-prem number, right, even if they ultimately get used on the Azure side. [SEP] This is because these benefits are essentially discounts that are applied to our customers' existing on-premises software licenses when they transfer those licenses to Azure. Therefore, it makes sense for us to attribute these benefits to our on-prem numbers. However, it's important to note that they still account for significant revenue for our Azure business overall.","2237":"We are pleased to present our earnings report for the third quarter of the fiscal year.

[SEP] And then keep in mind that there were a couple of things that affect the compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago, we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year. [SEP] However, we did incur increased legal fees this year related to ongoing patent disputes that impacted our bottom line. Overall, we are pleased with our continued growth and profitability.","2262":"We had a strong finish to the year, with solid results across all segments. [SEP] So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in our international markets, as well as increased investment in research and development.","2263":"Our team has been working hard to offer innovative and flexible options to our customers.

[SEP] And so to the degree that sales are distributed in the countries with disproportionally with shorter supply chains, or the standard deviation demand is less, we would always choose to have less inventory in those countries. [SEP] However, we understand the importance of meeting customer demand and will continue to make adjustments to our inventory levels as needed based on market trends and consumer behavior.","2280":"As we navigate through these challenging times, our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees, customers, and partners. We are closely monitoring the situation and adapting our business operations accordingly. [SEP] And now I think the important thing is that we execute on all the things that we need to do to make sure that we keep people safe. [SEP] We have implemented strict safety protocols in all of our facilities and offices, including regular sanitization, social distancing, and mandatory mask-wearing. Additionally, we are constantly monitoring the latest guidance and recommendations from public health officials to ensure we are taking all necessary precautions.","2281":"Our company has been closely monitoring the advancements in education technology and we are excited to see the possibilities it brings. [SEP] And I see apps that makes me want to go back to K-12 again and repeat my schooling because I think it changes the game in the classroom a lot. [SEP] We are committed to integrating these new technologies into our products to provide the best educational experience for our customers.","2282":"We are constantly monitoring the user experience and trying to find ways to improve it. Our latest feature, which allows businesses to sell directly through our platform, is an example of how we are doing this. [SEP] For businesses I think that this is going to help complete the loop and help them to actually sell more things which ultimately is what they care about when they're using the platform. [SEP] We are already seeing positive results from this feature, with a 20% increase in sales for businesses that have implemented it. We will continue to explore ways to enhance our platform and provide value to our users.","2283":"We have seen strong growth in our sales to this specific demographic over the past quarter. [SEP] I think I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of focus on serving that customer set. [SEP] Our team is working diligently to tailor our products and services to better meet the unique needs of this customer segment.","2284":"As we continue to invest more in original video content production, we want to ensure that we are accounting for these expenses in the most accurate and beneficial way possible. [SEP] And under that new guidance, we capitalize production cost for original video content. [SEP] This change in how we capitalize production cost for original video content should provide greater clarity in our financial reporting and help us more effectively manage our investments in this area moving forward.","2285":"Let's now shift our focus to our cloud services division. [SEP] Both were very good this quarter and it wasn't while certainly long-term Azure contracts had a meaningful component of the new, they weren't alone and being the only component of the new. [SEP] We're also seeing strong growth in our other cloud offerings like Dynamics 365 and Office 365 subscriptions.","2286":"We've noticed a significant shift in consumer behavior over the past few years. People are increasingly looking for convenience and customization, especially in the digital space. Our company has been adapting to these changes, but it's important to keep a long-term perspective. [SEP] Either one of those things, I think if we started viewing it quarter to quarter or year to year, we'll completely miss the trend. [SEP] Of course, we still monitor our financial performance on a regular basis. However, we try to look beyond the immediate numbers and focus on the underlying drivers of our success. This approach has served us well over the years and we believe it will continue to do so in the future.","2287":"We're now going to open the call up to questions from our investors and analysts. Who would like to go first? [SEP] And so the other things that you named, whether it be Apple Music or Apple Pay, both of these are very important to us. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're excited to continue expanding our product offerings and improving customer experiences. Thank you for your continued support and investment in Apple.","2288":"During the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our advertising revenue across all of our platforms. [SEP] So we do have Stories ads available across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and I think one of the most important things we learned as we were doing it transition to mobile is if we made it easy for our advertisers to place the ads, make sure they understood the measurement they were having and also make sure the ad format worked, businesses would move more quickly. [SEP] Our investments in ad measurement and targeting capabilities have allowed us to deliver more relevant and effective ads to our users, which has in turn driven higher engagement and revenue for our advertisers.","2289":"Now, turning to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] More I view, is the return healthy? [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with the results and believe our strategy is working well.","2290":"We've seen strong growth in our services business this quarter. [SEP] Our services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins. [SEP] In fact, our services business accounted for over a third of our total revenue for the quarter.","2291":"Now let's move on to our operational performance for the quarter. [SEP] So we had continued efficiency. [SEP] This was due to our ongoing investment in new technology and streamlined processes, which have allowed us to reduce costs and increase productivity across the board.","2292":"We continue to see strong adoption and usage of our family of apps, with over 2.7 billion monthly active users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. We're also investing heavily in new areas like VR and AR to build the future of computing. [SEP] So I mean across the whole family of apps, I mean all of this engagement is growing quickly and we're very happy with how we're enabling people to share. [SEP] In terms of monetization, we're seeing particularly strong growth in our ad business, driven by increasing demand from advertisers for our targeting and measurement capabilities. Overall, we remain focused on delivering value for our users and advertisers while investing for long-term growth.","2293":"CEO: \"Our expansion into international markets has been successful thus far. We've seen strong growth in our customer base in Europe and Asia. [SEP] So we're going to keep on doing more there. [SEP] CEO: \"In addition to international markets, we're looking at expanding our product line in the coming year. We see a lot of potential in the home goods and electronics markets.","2294":"We have some exciting updates to share with you all on our streaming services. [SEP] Obviously, we need to make some assumptions around the take rate of our customers on the -- on Apple TV+, right. [SEP] But based on our market research and early customer feedback, we feel confident in our projections for this platform.","2295":"During the conference call, a participant asked about the slow adoption rate of voice calling in certain regions. [SEP] So one of our theories in this is that it's one of the reasons why voice calling has been a little slower to catch on is because you need the large established network of people who you know will have access to be able to receive a voice call before it, before that behavior can really take on in a big global community. [SEP] However, we are seeing a shift in this trend as more and more people gain access to reliable networks and mobile devices.","2296":"During the last quarter, our subscriber base grew by 10% year-over-year, reaching over 300 million paid subscriptions. [SEP] There are, within the 300 million-plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third party video subscriptions and we see the growth that is going on there. [SEP] We expect the trend towards third-party video subscriptions to continue and plan to invest in this area to further enhance our offering to customers.","2297":"Our team has been working tirelessly to develop innovative solutions that cater to the evolving needs of our users. [SEP] We have a good operating system release for the core desktop user, and second, I believe is that we also expand out into new usage patterns. [SEP] Our aim is to offer a comprehensive suite of products and services that cater to a wide range of user preferences, and we are confident that our latest offerings will appeal to both our existing user base and new customers.","2298":"We've recently invested in our data analysis team in our Singapore office. [SEP] And we're growing that capability there. [SEP] As a result, we've seen a significant improvement in our ability to anticipate market trends and respond quickly to changes.","2299":"Can you speak more to the adoption of Stories by advertisers? [SEP] First, we need to convince marketers that people are using Stories, and I think having seen the mobile shift, their process \u2013 they\u2019re getting that I think more quickly. [SEP] Additionally, we are seeing strong engagement metrics from our users on Stories, which should reassure marketers about the potential impact of this format on their campaigns.","2300":"Now, I'd like to turn our attention to our cloud services division. [SEP] And Cosmos DB I think is very unique in its capability. [SEP] We've seen significant growth in Cosmos DB adoption among enterprise customers, and we expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","2301":"Now let's turn to our sales strategy for the upcoming year. [SEP] In fact there is always, and I think we also talked about how we get licenses sold and then, or subscriptions sold and then there's deployment. [SEP] Our focus this year will be to improve our deployment process to ensure a seamless experience for our customers.","2302":"Now moving on to our advertising business. [SEP] On the demand side, all of the things we do to get more advertisers active in our system, means we'll have more ads to choose from, to make those ads more relevant, to measure the ROI of those ads so that people can then iterate and, again, make those more relevant. [SEP] Overall, we are seeing strong growth in our advertising revenue as we continue to improve our system and attract new advertisers.","2303":"We're excited to announce our new advertising strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] We're going to all know a lot more after we roll out, but the thing that won't change is that advertisers are going to look at the highest ROI opportunity. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to ensure that our new campaign will achieve the highest level of return on investment for our clients.","2304":"We are pleased to announce that our earnings for the past quarter have exceeded our expectations. One of the contributing factors to our success is the performance of our data centers. [SEP] Obviously, part of that was in the capital leases being flat year-over-year, and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher efficiency. [SEP] In addition, we have been exploring new technologies and partnerships to further optimize our operations and reduce our energy consumption. We believe that by continuing to innovate, we can maintain our competitive edge and deliver value to our customers and shareholders alike.","2305":"When we compare the growth rates of our international and domestic segments for the quarter, we can see that the international segment had a growth rate of 20%, while the domestic segment had a growth rate of 15%. [SEP] So, by default, the International growth rate was higher. [SEP] Our team is focused on expanding our international presence even further by targeting key markets in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.","2306":"So, we've been working really hard on this new product launch. [SEP] And the execution is hard, right? [SEP] But we're confident that with the right team in place, we can overcome any challenges that come our way.","2307":"Our overall revenue for the quarter exceeded our expectations. [SEP] We had a, as I think Dave mentioned, the Echo Dot was the highest selling unit globally, so devices had very strong sales in the quarter. [SEP] Additionally, we saw growth in our services segment, particularly with the expansion of our streaming platform.","2308":"We are now going to address questions from analysts. [SEP] As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. [SEP] We have also seen great demand for the new Apple Watch Series 2 and AirPods. Our retail stores have been bustling with customers eager to get their hands on these products. Overall, we are very pleased with the reception of our latest releases and look forward to continued success in the future.","2309":"I would like to address a question we received from one of our investors regarding our decision to invest in Marketplace. [SEP] So I think your basic point is right, that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab around that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things. [SEP] As a result, we saw an opportunity to create a dedicated platform within Facebook to support buying and selling activities. Since launching Marketplace, we have seen significant growth and engagement within our community.","2310":"We've received a lot of feedback from our clients about our platform. [SEP] And all they need is just a very robust field service module that's cost-effective and efficient. [SEP] With that in mind, our team is currently focused on developing and launching a state-of-the-art field service module that meets all of our clients' needs.","2311":"Now let's turn to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] Sequentially, we increased 170 basis points. [SEP] This growth in margin was driven by a combination of cost-cutting measures and improved pricing strategies.","2312":"Our Q3 financial results are in and we're excited to share with you our progress. [SEP] And so we could not be more pleased with how we're doing.

[SEP] For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. [SEP] This unit growth was driven by a number of factors, including new product launches, targeted marketing campaigns, and improved customer retention.\n- We are particularly encouraged by the growth we have seen in emerging markets, where we are investing heavily to build brand awareness and expand our footprint.\n- Looking ahead, we remain committed to delivering strong results for our shareholders and creating value for all our stakeholders.","2314":"During the Q&A session, a participant asked about the progress Facebook has made in improving its content moderation policies. [SEP] But if you look at areas like hate speech, which are just much more nuanced linguistically, it really depends on the local language, that's an area where I think it's going to take more years to be able to do something reasonably. [SEP] However, we have made significant progress in detecting and removing terrorist propaganda and graphic violence. We are constantly improving our AI technology and working with experts to help us better understand the cultural nuances of different countries and languages.","2315":"Looking at the revenue figures for this quarter, I'm pleased to see that we have exceeded our targets. [SEP] What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing and it is encouraging that the plan that we put in place, that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on. [SEP] As we continue to grow and expand our customer base, I believe we will see even more positive results in the months and years to come.","2316":"Our sales strategy has been successful thus far, with our revenue increasing by 15% from last year. [SEP] We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. [SEP] We anticipate even more positive reviews with the release of the iPhone 8 next quarter.","2317":"Investor: \"Can you speak to any potential changes in expenses going forward? [SEP] So I don't feel like you'd expect any material change in those, Mark. [SEP] CEO: \"No, I don't think there will be any significant changes in our expenses in the near future.","2318":"Now turning to our long-term strategy. [SEP] So if you think back to how we've talked about the long term, the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over time, and we had lots of encouraging signs about that. [SEP] We're confident that this focus on lifetime value will continue to drive growth and success for the company.","2319":"Thank you for joining us for this quarter's earnings call. [SEP] Our strategy is always to make the best products. [SEP] Our focus this quarter has been on expanding our market share in Asia. We believe that our commitment to creating high-quality products will help us achieve this goal.","2320":"Now, let's talk about our financial performance over the past year. [SEP] I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. [SEP] This impressive growth can be attributed to the implementation of our new marketing strategy and increased investment in technology.","2321":"As we review our financial performance for the year, I would like to highlight a few key trends that influenced our results. [SEP] We also have a more difficult memory pricing environment this year than a year ago. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain optimistic about our ability to navigate the market and deliver on our long-term growth strategy.","2322":"So, let's move on to the financial highlights of the quarter. [SEP] No real surprises there. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with our performance and remain optimistic about the future.","2323":"We are seeing tremendous growth in our user base over the past quarter [SEP] And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share so many different kinds of content, ranging from text to photo to video, just richer and richer and more immersive content. [SEP] As a result, we have been investing heavily in our infrastructure to ensure that we can continue to provide the seamless experience our users have come to expect.","2324":"During the past quarter, we have focused on expanding our market presence in emerging markets. [SEP] We see a lot of growth there. [SEP] As a result of our efforts, we expect to see a significant increase in revenue from these regions in the coming year.","2325":"We've analyzed our current sales figures and market trends extensively over the past quarter. [SEP] So that's why we're giving that indication of what we expect. [SEP] Of course, there are always external factors that could affect our projections, but we feel confident in our ability to meet these expectations.","2326":"Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our iPhone sales performance. [SEP] The iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we've measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6. [SEP] However, we anticipate strong demand for our upcoming iPhone 7 launch in the second half of this fiscal year.","2327":"Now turning to our strategic growth initiatives. The first area we will focus on is international expansion. [SEP] The other area is streaming. [SEP] We saw significant growth in our streaming services this past quarter, with a 25% increase in subscribers compared to the same quarter last year. We plan to continue investing in original content and expanding our partnerships with other media companies to further drive growth in this area.","2328":"We are committed to integrating our various services and channels to enhance our customers' experience and make Amazon the premier destination for grocery shopping. [SEP] As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. [SEP] This integration will allow us to offer our customers a wider range of options, greater convenience, and even faster delivery times. We know our customers value quality products and exceptional service, and we are excited to bring the best of Amazon and Whole Foods together to deliver that experience.","2329":"We are excited to report our latest marketing results. [SEP] They reached over 36 million people in a target demo within three days. [SEP] Our advertising team executed a successful social media campaign that generated high engagement rates.","2330":"I'd now like to turn to our community initiatives and highlight some recent successes. [SEP] And so I'll share just one example but one I really love, which is the Alameda County Fair, which is a local fairground in Pleasanton, California. [SEP] Through our partnership with the fair, we were able to provide free admission and transportation for over 1,000 underserved families in the area, allowing them to enjoy all the festivities without financial burden.","2331":"We've seen some fierce competition in the market, particularly from some of the newer entrants. Our sales team has been working around the clock to try and secure our position. [SEP] And so I think it's product first, and then prices sort of falls out of that, and we did decide to be more aggressive. [SEP] Of course, being more aggressive with prices is a risk. However, we believe that it's a calculated risk that we need to take if we're going to stay ahead of the competition. We'll be monitoring the situation closely, and we're prepared to adjust if necessary.","2332":"We have seen an increase in demand from our customers over the past few months. [SEP] Yes, order size can go up, but we ship a lot of toys and bigger items. [SEP] Our fulfillment centers have been able to handle the larger items with ease, but we are constantly monitoring our processes to ensure efficient shipping.","2333":"Can you comment on the potential impact of the current market volatility on your business? [SEP] And of course, as I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve never worried about that. [SEP] We believe in the resilience of our business model and remain confident in our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders.","2334":"We have made a conscious effort to diversify our product offerings and customer base over the past year.

We will continue to look for new opportunities to expand our reach and improve our offerings.","2335":"We have had a very successful quarter and are excited to announce our latest commercial deal. [SEP] I\u2019m not going to comment on any specific dollar terms, it is the largest commercial deal that we\u2019ve signed of the size and we see -- we\u2019ve line of sight to many more such deals. [SEP] We are confident that this deal will help us continue to grow and expand our business in the coming years.","2336":"We have seen a decrease in smartphone sales in the United States over the past quarter. This can largely be attributed to the recent changes in carrier subsidies for smartphones. [SEP] The subsidy, the lack of that \u2013 and this is more of a U.S. phenomenon than the rest of the world, some of that can be a shock for people that were used to paying $199 for their smartphone. [SEP] However, we have also seen an increase in sales of mid-range smartphones as consumers look for more affordable options. Moving forward, we will continue to monitor the market trends and adjust our strategy accordingly.","2337":"Our team has been hard at work developing new tools and technologies to enhance productivity and collaboration. [SEP] I think if we can really change the way people work, I think the opportunity is enormous. [SEP] As we look forward, our focus will be on expanding our reach and increasing adoption among businesses of all sizes.","2338":"When it comes to our financing program, we're finding that more and more customers are opting to trade in their old devices in order to lower the monthly cost of their new iPhone. [SEP] And the residual value for iPhone tends to be the highest in the industry and many people pick up $300, $350 or so for their iPhone and so that even reduces the monthly payment less. [SEP] We believe this is a testament to the high quality and durability of our products, and we will continue to prioritize the sustainability of our devices and their value for our customers.","2339":"Now moving on to our advertising strategies for the quarter. [SEP] So on that, I think what we're continuing to see with Stories monetization is, that is a product that's experiencing a lot of impression growth. [SEP] We have also seen an increase in ad revenue generated from Stories as more advertisers are recognizing its potential.","2340":"As we continue to integrate our latest acquisition with our existing technology, we are excited about the potential for further growth and innovation. Our team has been working diligently to identify the key synergies between these two products. [SEP] We think we're at the very beginning of what's possible when we combine these two. [SEP] In the coming months, we will be rolling out several new features that will further enhance the user experience and provide even greater value to our customers. We believe that our unique combination of capabilities has the potential to transform the industry and we are committed to staying at the forefront of this innovation.","2341":"Our company's financial performance has been impacted by various factors in the past few quarters. [SEP] And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4 and it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market. [SEP] We are confident that our product strategy, marketing initiatives, and investments in R&D will pay off in the long run. \n\n\"And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4 and it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market. We have already taken steps to address the issue and are closely monitoring the market conditions. Our goal is to ensure that our customers have access to high-quality products at competitive prices. We are committed to delivering value to our shareholders and are optimistic about the future prospects of our business.","2342":"Our company's focus this quarter has been on building a strong foundation for our platform.\"\n- \"As part of our strategy, we have invested heavily in fostering a thriving ecosystem. [SEP] We think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem. [SEP] We've seen tremendous growth and engagement from our partners and users as a result.\"\n- \"Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize the health of our ecosystem in our decision-making to ensure long-term success.","2343":"We have received quite a few questions from investors regarding our key performance indicators for bookings. [SEP] But I do think the more helpful KPI for us in terms of bookings is the commercial one. [SEP] Our commercial bookings include contracts with higher average order values and longer-term commitments, so it gives us a better understanding of the health of our business.","2344":"We've been talking a lot about our long-term goals and vision for the company, and I wanted to take a moment to dive a little deeper into our plans for ecosystem development. This is an area that we see as critical to our success in the coming years, and I'm excited about the progress we've already made. [SEP] So the work that we started talking about at F8 that we are releasing slowly over the course of the year is certainly one of the precursors for building out that ecosystem that I'm excited about. [SEP] Of course, there's a lot of work still to be done, and we know that building out a robust ecosystem takes time and effort. But I'm confident that we have the talent, resources, and vision needed to make it happen. As we continue to release new products and features throughout the year, we'll be keeping a close eye on user feedback and making adjustments as needed to ensure that we're delivering the best possible experience. Thank you all for your continued support and engagement.","2345":"Our sales for the quarter have exceeded our projections. [SEP] but we're pleased with the growth. [SEP] We believe this growth is a result of our strategic marketing efforts and product innovation.","2346":"We are proud to announce that our company has doubled its investment in outsourced labor from India. [SEP] And there's a lot of research that we've seen and reports that third parties have put out that show, that when you connect to place like India, it makes a very big difference socially and for the economy there. [SEP] As a company, we are committed to not only achieving financial success but also making a positive impact on the communities in which we operate. By increasing our partnership with Indian companies, we are contributing to the growth and development of the country's economy.","2347":"Our financial results for the quarter were quite positive overall. [SEP] It was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than was in our guidance. [SEP] We believe this was due to unexpected expenses that arose during the quarter, and we are taking steps to address them going forward.","2348":"We've had a lot of positive feedback from customers about our new product line. [SEP] So the pricing is really attractive. [SEP] As a result, we expect to see strong sales growth in the coming quarters.","2349":"We continue to innovate and experiment with our products across all our platforms. [SEP] You can see that a little bit in the announcement and launch of Instagram Stories and what we're doing with Messenger and some of the additional tests on Facebook and the camera work that we're doing in WhatsApp. [SEP] Our focus remains on developing engaging experiences for our users that drive growth for our business.","2350":"When we look at the global landscape, we see that the adoption of digital technologies has accelerated in a major way. [SEP] So it is the country in the world that benefits the most from connectivity. [SEP] And we believe that our company is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, especially given our investments in cutting-edge infrastructure and expert talent.","2351":"We've been reviewing our customer feedback and analyzing our operations to identify ways we can enhance the overall customer experience. Our goal is to make sure we're meeting and exceeding customer expectations in every aspect of our business. [SEP] Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. [SEP] In addition to improving selection and delivery, we're also investing in technology to streamline the ordering process and reduce wait times. We're confident that these efforts will result in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty going forward.","2352":"Our revenue from mobile advertising has been steadily increasing. [SEP] But now between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which are two very broad communication networks, we're pretty confident that because of the higher quality of calling that you can get through the services that we're providing that this is going to continue growing very quickly. [SEP] We're also exploring ways to improve the user experience and engagement on these platforms through new features and integrations.","2353":"I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, who will give an update on our recent performance and outlook for the future. [SEP] In terms of monetizing some of our newer attempts at products in News Feed such as Ad Break, those are really in early experimental stages, and for now, we're really focused primarily on our core business, our core ad products, of which video is one. [SEP] However, we recognize the potential in these new areas and will continue to invest in them. We believe that over time, they could provide additional sources of revenue for our business. We will keep you updated on any developments in these areas.","2354":"Our goal for the next year is to expand our product line and enter new markets. [SEP] As you've seen from our track record during the last five years, we will do it at a very fast pace but we also want to do it efficiently. [SEP] To achieve this, we will be investing in new technology and hiring additional staff to support our growth.","2355":"We have seen a decrease in our server maintenance costs this quarter. [SEP] It's rather a reflection of the work that we've done to make our server capacity last longer. [SEP] This not only benefits our company financially, but it also creates a better user experience for our customers.","2356":"As part of our expansion plans, we have been looking into ways to optimize our supply chain. [SEP] We thought it made sense to go ahead and buy some trailers, we're actually still contracting out for the truck part. [SEP] However, with the increased demand for our products, we have noticed that our current logistics process may not be sustainable in the long run.","2357":"Our Q2 results exceeded expectations and we are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum moving forward. [SEP] That starts in Q3, but there's a number of other factors that I also pointed to, including the desktop lapping some of the efforts we made on desktop in terms of unblocking or working against the ad blocking technologies. [SEP] Therefore, we expect to see continued revenue growth in the coming quarters, especially as our desktop advertising efforts gain traction and ad blocking becomes less of a hindrance.","2358":"I'm really pleased with the progress we've made over the last quarter. We've been focused on optimizing our operations and improving efficiency across the board. [SEP] It's a bunch of different places in which I think we made improvements.

[SEP] We're really proud of these results and remain confident in our ability to continue delivering growth for our shareholders.","2364":"We've seen some challenges in using third-party data to target our ads. Firstly, with the changes to third-party cookie tracking, it's becoming increasingly difficult to attribute meaningful results to our advertising efforts. [SEP] Secondly, mobile operating systems and browser providers such as Apple and Google have announced product changes and future plans that will limit our ability to use those signals. [SEP] As a result, we've been shifting our focus towards building our first-party data capabilities, which will allow us to better understand our customers and target them more effectively. We're also exploring new channels and methods for reaching our audience, such as influencer marketing and contextual advertising.","2365":"We have developed a new product that we are excited to release to the market. [SEP] It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth.

Thank you for your continued support.","2384":"Our advertising business continues to be a key driver of our revenue growth. [SEP] Because we are looking to show relevant ads to the right person at the right time, the systems we have that understand in a privacy-protected way what ads people are likely to be more interested in, those work, whether you're in Stories or Watch or Instagram Feed or News Feed. [SEP] In fact, we recently made updates to our algorithms to improve the relevance and personalization of ads for our users.","2385":"We've seen a significant increase in our user base in recent months due to the popularity of our free offerings. [SEP] And obviously in - finally in getting more people that are enjoying things for free to - let to pay for some of the premium services. [SEP] Our goal is to continue providing high-quality free content while also offering value-added features to those willing to pay for them.","2386":"We've received a lot of questions about why we've decided to prioritize mid-roll ads over pre-roll ads on Facebook. [SEP] In terms of why mid-roll is preferable to pre-roll, Facebook is well suited for shorter-form content where we're ranking things to be longer-form as well.

As more and more customers look for fast, convenient shopping options, we believe same-day delivery will be a key driver of growth for our business.","2389":"During the last quarter, we saw a significant increase in the number of businesses creating interactive messaging experiences through our Messenger platform. [SEP] If you're a business and you have a higher ROI for interacting with a person in your messaging thread than you do on the mobile web or trying to get them to install an app, then that creates this positive feedback loop, where you're going to point your ads towards the Messenger thread. [SEP] In addition to businesses seeing higher ROI, we've also seen a notable increase in user engagement with businesses through Messenger, which is a testament to the power of personalized and convenient messaging experiences.","2390":"We are very excited about the growth we are seeing in international markets, particularly China. Our iPad sales have been particularly strong in this market, and we believe there is still plenty of room for growth. [SEP] But if you look at iPad as just an example, in China, 68% of the people that purchased an iPad it was the first tablet they've owned and 40% of those have never owned any Apple product.

We are confident that we can continue to capture market share in this important region and build on the momentum we have established.","2391":"We've been focusing a lot on improving the user experience of our platform.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the holiday season and are working hard to continue this positive momentum.","2394":"I'd like to highlight our investments in our infrastructure to support our growing shipping volumes.

[SEP] We're constantly working to improve the user experience on the Audience Network, and we've recently implemented a new algorithm that's shown promising results in increasing engagement.","2398":"We've been running a variety of ad campaigns across multiple platforms over the last few months. [SEP] What matters the most is the A\/B test that these people saw ads on Facebook and Instagram, these people didn't, and here's the sales lift. [SEP] Based on our analysis, we believe that Facebook and Instagram achieved the most success in terms of driving sales for our business.","2399":"Our video sharing platform has seen significant growth over the past quarter. [SEP] That's because you can shoot it on your mobile device, you can upload it, you can do that for free or you can pay us for the ad.

[SEP] However, we expect these investments to drive long-term growth and profitability for the company.","2401":"Now, turning to our product updates and innovations over the past quarter. [SEP] And on Live video, the theme that I think is most important is just that there's so much that people want to express and share with the people around them that they don't have the tools to do today. [SEP] That's why we're investing heavily in improving our Live video capabilities and creating new features to make it easier for our users to connect and share their experiences.","2402":"Our e-commerce sales continue to rise, accounting for over 50% of our total sales this quarter. [SEP] So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that.

[SEP] Over the next several years as we develop an understanding of all of the content on Facebook that won\u2019t be a constraint anymore. [SEP] We are confident that by continuing to invest in our content moderation efforts while also providing advertisers with more transparent and effective tools, we will be able to maintain strong growth in our ad revenue.","2404":"We recognize that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company.

Additionally, we foresee increased competition in the marketplace, which could potentially impact sales.","2415":"During the past quarter, we conducted market research to better understand our customer base. We discovered that our customer base fell into two distinct groups. [SEP] And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick service restaurant purchasers. [SEP] To cater to these two groups, we will be launching two separate marketing campaigns. The first campaign will target our loyal customers, offering them exclusive deals and discounts.

We believe that these campaigns will help us expand our customer base and increase our revenue.","2416":"Can you talk a little bit about the growth of your company?

[SEP] Looking ahead, we continue to see a significant opportunity for Teams to drive even greater collaboration and productivity gains for our customers.","2424":"We have received some questions around our messaging platform and how we plan to monetize it. [SEP] I mean in terms of the focus on privacy, the one thing that I would \u2013 I would sort of cite there, if anything the priority for messaging is clear, the focus on privacy and interoperability, and that means that monetization for messaging is a lower, near-term priority so that has some \u2013 has some impact on the outlook. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to drive revenue growth through other areas of our business and believe that prioritizing privacy and interoperability in our messaging platform will ultimately lead to long-term success.

[SEP] Now, we\u2019re always looking for ways to optimize user experience and engagement, which is why we\u2019ve implemented new features such as personalized content recommendations.","2427":"We have had great success in expanding our product offering and reaching new customer segments. [SEP] So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course there are opportunities. [SEP] However, we need to ensure we have the resources and talent to execute on these opportunities, and we will be investing in those areas as needed.","2428":"Our Q2 results showed a deceleration in revenue growth compared to previous quarters. [SEP] So, just broadly, I think we expect the revenue deceleration trend that Q2 is not mark a reversal of that, but we expect to kind of return to constant currency revenue growth deceleration as you get into the remainder of 2019.

[SEP] Can you elaborate on the strategies the company has implemented to reach such a young demographic in China?","2854":"We have been investing heavily in our data centers to keep up with the massive growth in demand for our services. [SEP] But the majority of the investment today is continuing to build capacity inside existing incredibly large data centers. [SEP] This approach has allowed us to optimize our infrastructure and improve operational efficiency, while also providing us with the flexibility to scale up rapidly when needed.","2855":"Our company has always had a strong focus on innovation and providing value to our customers. We believe that automating certain activities can not only save time and resources, but also improve the overall effectiveness of our advertising platform.

[SEP] We believe that leveraging this inventory and our expertise in video will be key drivers of growth in the coming quarters.","2861":"We have received a lot of questions from analysts and investors regarding our approach to state sales tax collection and reporting. We would like to take this opportunity to clarify our strategy and outline our plans for the future. [SEP] So right now, as you mentioned 45 states that have state-imposed sales tax, first-party products we do our own collection on that. [SEP] However, when it comes to third-party products sold through our platform, the responsibility for sales tax collection falls on the individual sellers. We do provide guidance and resources to help them comply with state sales tax laws, but ultimately it is their responsibility to handle the collection and reporting. We believe this approach strikes a balance between fairness for our sellers and compliance with state regulations.","2862":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our holiday products and services in the last quarter.

[SEP] It's a third-party marketplace offering. [SEP] The platform has already seen significant growth in user engagement and sales.","2866":"Now, I'd like to turn our attention to our growth strategy. [SEP] We've been acquiring companies over the years. [SEP] These acquisitions have helped us expand our offerings and reach new markets.","2867":"We're really excited about the potential for our new video platform. As we mentioned before, we're putting a lot of resources towards developing high-quality video content. We believe this will be a key driver of growth moving forward. [SEP] And then even after we establish a flywheel here and get content being produced for ad revenue share, that's going have a different margin structure than core News Feed. [SEP] Of course, there are still many challenges ahead. We need to make sure we're attracting the right talent and building a loyal audience.

[SEP] We're also starting to see strong demand for the 6 Plus in Europe and the United States, which is encouraging. While we don't disclose exact sales figures, we can confidently say that the 6 Plus is a major driver of our revenue growth this quarter.","2870":"One of the questions that we often get asked is about our efforts to combat harmful content. [SEP] One of the things that we're proud of there is, there are now 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda content that we take down, our AI flags it, removes it before people see it. [SEP] Of course, we're committed to continuing to improve our technology to ensure that we catch even more harmful content before it has a chance to spread.","2871":"We were expecting to see a significant increase in revenue from our new product line in the first quarter.

[SEP] Have you considered expanding into other operating systems or software solutions?\"\n\nFull statement: \"Even EMS, when I think about our management, our management was just about Windows management. Can you speak more to the diversification of your product offerings? Have you considered expanding into other operating systems or software solutions?","2875":"We are excited to announce the release of our latest product, the Apple Watch. [SEP] And Apple Watch margins will be lower than company average. [SEP] However, we anticipate robust sales and believe the Apple Watch will be a significant contributor to our overall revenue.","2876":"In response to an analyst's question about whether the company has seen any changes in user behavior regarding video content on the platform. [SEP] So there, we've really had this dynamic over the last 12 to 18 months where we've limited the amount of video that we've shown in order to make sure - in News Feed, to make sure that it doesn't displace interactions, social interactions that people are having. [SEP] But now, we're starting to see some opportunities to balance that out a bit more and to potentially increase the amount of video that people are seeing in a way that doesn't negatively impact those social interactions.","2877":"We've seen exceptional growth in our advertising revenue this past quarter.

[SEP] Our team has been working hard to improve our advertising tools and make them more accessible to small businesses.","2880":"One question we frequently receive is how we plan to monetize our various applications and features. [SEP] We're figuring out the extent to which those should grow to be big, independent apps over time, or should be integrated into the core of the Instagram service or our other messaging apps. [SEP] It's important to note that determining the path forward for these features will take time and be carefully considered to ensure the best outcome for our users and our business.

This feature allows publishers to share their content directly on our platform, rather than linking to an external website. [SEP] The hypothesis when we rolled it out was that if we removed the latency, which is often 10 seconds to 15 seconds of opening up a web view from News Feed that more people would read news. [SEP] After analyzing the data, we found that the removal of latency did indeed lead to an increase in readership. In fact, articles published through Instant Articles were read 20% more frequently than those accessed through the traditional web view. As a result, we plan to expand this feature to more publishers in the coming months.","2885":"Our company has seen strong growth in recent quarters, driven by strong demand for our products both domestically and internationally. However, there are a few factors that we will need to navigate in the coming months that may impact our earnings. [SEP] As we look forward, and we look into particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 for two main reasons.

We will be closely monitoring the situation and adjusting our approach as needed to ensure that we continue to deliver strong results for our investors.","2886":"Our goal is to continue growing and improving the user experience on Facebook.

So, we are constantly analyzing and testing different promotions to find the right balance between customer value and profitability.","2895":"We've made significant changes to how we account for certain advertising services that we offer to our clients. These changes were made in order to comply with updated accounting standards and are aimed at providing greater transparency to our stakeholders.

[SEP] While the adoption of these changes did have an impact on our reported revenue figures, we believe that this is a positive step towards greater clarity and consistency in our financial reporting. Going forward, we will continue to review and refine our accounting practices to ensure that we are in compliance with all relevant regulations and that we are providing accurate, transparent financial information to our investors.","2896":"We were able to make a strategic acquisition last quarter that really paid off for us. It was a unique situation that aligned perfectly with our goals and allowed us to expand into a new market. [SEP] And so it's not part of a broader pattern, or although I wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time. [SEP] However, I want to emphasize that we are not actively seeking out M&A opportunities at this time. Our focus is on organic growth and continuing to improve our existing business operations. But we are always open to exploring strategic opportunities if they arise.","2897":"As we think about our product roadmap, we are constantly looking for ways to improve the user experience. [SEP] There is lots of ways we use data to make the product better. [SEP] One example of how we use data is by analyzing user behavior patterns to inform feature updates.","2898":"We've seen strong growth in our top line this quarter. [SEP] But you're right, there are always pressures in that. [SEP] However, we believe we can navigate those pressures and continue to deliver results for our shareholders.","2899":"So, as we look at our overall revenue streams, we continue to see growth in many areas of our business. [SEP] And that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with the strength and diversity of our revenue streams, and we will continue to focus on driving growth in key areas moving forward.","2900":"We have seen a significant increase in our customer base over the last quarter. [SEP] And also just on the growth point, I just think the team that's working on that is executing extremely well. [SEP] Our focus on innovation and strategic partnerships has helped us stay ahead of the competition and continue this growth trajectory.","2901":"As we review our financial performance for the quarter, there are a few key points that I want to highlight. [SEP] Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. [SEP] However, this was largely expected as we continue to integrate the Whole Foods brand into our operations. We remain confident in the long-term benefits this acquisition will bring.","2902":"Our international markets continue to face some challenges, particularly in Latin America. However, we're confident in our long-term growth strategies and are continuing to invest in our overseas operations. [SEP] I mean we saw the impact in places like Brazil, where you\u2019ve gotten in currency headwind of over 30%. [SEP] Despite these currency headwinds, we've still managed to see growth in our Brazilian market thanks to strong demand for our products. We're also exploring ways to mitigate currency risks and optimize our operations in these challenging markets.","2903":"We are excited to announce our new venture into the field of artificial intelligence.

As part of that effort, we've been experimenting with new ways to make our website more interactive and engaging. [SEP] And it can be a much more immersive experience and we've already found from the initial experiments that we've done that the engagement is positive and we're starting to roll that out more broadly. [SEP] We're also exploring other ways we can leverage technology to improve customer engagement, including machine learning and virtual reality. Our goal is to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for every customer who interacts with our brand online.","2906":"We have been working on measures to increase customer engagement and loyalty over the last quarter. [SEP] So there'll be an incremental differential in Q1 on those price cuts, but this is something that we again have quite frequently and I don't think it's a large factor in Q1. [SEP] Overall, we remain bullish on our growth prospects going into Q1 and throughout the rest of the year, and we look forward to delivering value to our shareholders and customers alike.","2907":"We are very pleased with the strong growth in our revenue this quarter. [SEP] and that's because I think we solve a really big problem for SMBs, which is how are they going to reach customers. [SEP] Our team has been continually innovating to provide effective solutions for our clients, and we believe this is reflected in our financial results.","2908":"Our quarterly earnings report has shown growth in many areas, but there are some challenges we've faced in the international market. [SEP] And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. [SEP] This appreciation has negatively impacted our profit margins and overall financial performance. We are evaluating strategies to mitigate this impact and remain competitive in our global market.","2909":"As we look to the future of our company, we see tremendous potential for growth. Our focus is on innovation and staying ahead of market trends. [SEP] The layer above that is the place which we are very excited about.

[SEP] This approach has been well received by our customers and has allowed us to remain competitive in the market.","2911":"Now let's take a look at our performance in China. This is a critical market for us given its size and growth potential. [SEP] In terms of China, the LTE penetration as of the end of last October, which is the last data I've got, was in the mid-20s.

We will continue to invest in expanding our network and improving our offerings to capture even more market share.","2912":"We've seen strong growth in our gaming and productivity segments, but we acknowledge that there is room for improvement in our devices segment. We believe that our upcoming Windows 10 release will be a key driver of growth in this area.

[SEP] I think that the far bigger thing is to look over a longer period of time. [SEP] As we've seen in the past, fluctuations in the market and our industry can have a significant impact on quarterly earnings.\n- Our growth strategy is designed to create sustainable, long-term value for shareholders, which requires a focus on steady progress rather than immediate gains.","2914":"Now, turning to our financial performance this quarter.

[SEP] The number of people who have opted out on using context from the apps and websites they visit for ad targeting has continued to increase since the adoption of GDPR, so we\u2019ve seen that come up both in Europe and around the world. [SEP] As a result, we\u2019ve been exploring alternative ways to personalize our advertising efforts, such as through partnerships with third-party data providers and other innovative approaches.","2917":"We are excited to announce the launch of our new product line. [SEP] That\u2019s the initial market. [SEP] However, we plan to expand our reach into other markets in the near future.","2918":"We've had a very strong quarter and I am pleased to report our earnings today. [SEP] And so you're seeing \u2013 of course, the auction drives pricing and there has been interplay between the supply growth and the pricing growth, and we're seeing the strong demand play through on the pricing side.

[SEP] And as you probably know, as I had reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid-June. [SEP] However, despite the challenges with inventory flow, we are proud to report that our overall sales revenue exceeded our expectations and we are optimistic about the future.","2926":"Our analysis shows that there is a significant growth opportunity in the Asian market. [SEP] and we're going to continue to invest there. [SEP] We believe that by increasing our presence in this region, we can capitalize on this opportunity and drive long-term profitability for the company.","2927":"We've made progress on addressing the issue, but there's still work to be done. [SEP] It's still definitely having some overhang. [SEP] We're confident that we can fully resolve it in the coming quarters.","2928":"We've had a challenging year, but we remain confident in our ongoing transformation efforts. [SEP] And we do expect material improvement in FY 2017, both from the benefits of scale and the investments we've made, but importantly also in the revenue trajectory we're seeing and the makeup of that revenue. [SEP] Overall, we're optimistic about the direction of our business and the opportunities ahead.","2929":"Another analyst questioned our strategy for expanding into China.

[SEP] This approach has allowed us to better understand the cultural nuances of doing business in the region.","2930":"We have seen tremendous growth and success in our subscription services over the past quarter. [SEP] So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just \u2013 the units do not count in this unit calculation. [SEP] However, we remain committed to investing in and expanding our subscription offerings to drive continued growth and better serve the needs of our customers.","2931":"Thank you for your question. \n- I understand you're interested in our current performance drivers. [SEP] And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3. [SEP] However, we are also seeing some positive contributions from our expansion into emerging markets.\n- As we continue to focus on innovation and customer satisfaction, we expect to see even more growth in the coming quarters.","2932":"In the previous quarter, our AWS business demonstrated strong growth momentum, driven by an increase in usage and a broad expansion of its customer base. [SEP] On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this is primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. [SEP] Looking forward, we anticipate that AWS will continue to play a critical role in our overall growth strategy and remain a key focus area for investment and innovation.","2933":"Our advertising revenue for the quarter showed strong performance, driven largely by our continued investment in our platform.

Our marketing campaigns have been effective in driving both brand awareness and direct response. [SEP] We're growing quite nicely across brand and DR.

We plan to continue investing in marketing to sustain our growth.","2935":"We're really excited about the growth opportunities we see in our industry. As we've discussed, we plan to invest heavily in technology and marketing to maintain our competitive edge. [SEP] That clearly is going to have implications for margins along with the other big investments that we're making next year. [SEP] However, we believe these investments will pay off in the long run, as they will help us capture greater market share and drive stronger revenue growth.","2936":"Now turning to our retail operations, I am pleased to report that we have achieved strong growth in sales this quarter. [SEP] We\u2019ve taken our brand to more places and we continue to open new retail stores around the world.

[SEP] So, you will see significant synergies in terms of the architectural platform underneath gaming, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn all being the same.

[SEP] Our team is already exploring ways to take advantage of this new landscape and we think it could be a game-changer for our industry.","2943":"We continue to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure. Our investments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are transforming the way we do business. [SEP] You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. [SEP] We are also making progress on our delivery initiatives, including the expansion of our one-day and same-day delivery services. Furthermore, we are exploring new markets for our Amazon Web Services division and are excited about the potential for growth in this area.","2944":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in revenue from our mobile advertising platform.

[SEP] For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. [SEP] Our company has been putting a lot of resources into researching and developing edge computing technologies.\"\n\n\"For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. In fact, we believe that edge computing will be the next big thing in technology. This is because edge computing allows for faster processing of data and reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent back and forth to the cloud. As a result, this can lead to improved performance and reduced costs for businesses. Our company has been putting a lot of resources into researching and developing edge computing technologies. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this emerging trend in the industry and drive growth for our company.","2958":"We've seen strong momentum in our video advertising business, with more and more advertisers utilizing this format to reach their target audience. In fact, video ads now represent a significant portion of our overall ad revenue. [SEP] It's worth pointing out that, as Sheryl mentioned, video does displace other ads in News Feed.

We're continuing to invest in this area and exploring new ways to improve the delivery and measurement of video ads on our platform.","2959":"Can you give us some color on how you expect the company's performance to trend for the rest of the year?

We will continue to closely monitor the situation and make any necessary adjustments to our strategy to ensure we are well-positioned for any potential challenges.","2960":"We believe that the hybrid cloud is the future of enterprise computing. With the proliferation of data and the need for instant access to it, companies need the flexibility to store and process their data both on-premises and in the cloud. [SEP] Most people think about hybrid where they think about the cloud as the edge of their server. [SEP] However, we see the hybrid cloud as much more than just cloud-based storage. In fact, we believe that the cloud can be thought of as the new edge of your server, providing advanced analytics, machine learning, and other capabilities that were once only available on-premises. By leveraging the hybrid cloud, companies can take advantage of these capabilities while still maintaining control over their core data assets.","2961":"We've had a lot of questions around gross margin and how it may trend over time. [SEP] And I would say, the way to think about that and you see it in the gross margin percentages and the improvements we've continued to see is the Azure premium revenue growth exceeding the overall revenue growth that actually is a benefit to the gross margin rate. [SEP] So, we definitely believe the premium mix helps our gross margin because it does carry higher gross margin contribution, and we really see that playing out pretty strongly in Q3.","2962":"We've seen a significant uptick in our marketing spend over the past quarter as we continue to drive awareness and engagement with our brand. [SEP] In the short run, some of the spend is incremental and some isn't.

Our operating profit increased by 30% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also to a lesser extent the stock-based compensation, which certainly hits across all of our businesses. [SEP] We believe that these investments in sales and marketing personnel will continue to drive growth for AWS in the future. As for stock-based compensation, we understand that it can have an impact on our bottom line, but we also believe it is important to attract and retain top talent in our industry.","2964":"Now moving on to our financial performance. [SEP] And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're \u2013 we are accelerating.

It will allow us to scale more efficiently, reduce downtime, and lay the groundwork for future features and capabilities.","2966":"We are pleased to report a strong quarter for our APAC business. Our team has been working hard to expand our presence and deepen our relationships with customers in the region.

[SEP] It set a unit record, so that I can share. [SEP] Our team put in a lot of hard work to achieve this milestone.","2969":"Our company's focus on innovation and product development has been instrumental in the success of our latest product launches.

[SEP] So, we\u2019re going to have a tougher compare on that basis. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to maintain steady growth throughout the rest of the year and continue to exceed market expectations.","2971":"Now let's take a look at our gross margin for the quarter. [SEP] So, without it, our gross margin would have been 39.7%.

[SEP] We\u2019ve opened a period of, however, long it takes to address regulators and different experts and constituents questions about this and then figure out what the best way to move forward is and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re planning to do with Libra. [SEP] We understand the importance of working closely with regulators and stakeholders to ensure that Libra is compliant, secure, and meets their expectations.","2973":"We've made some changes to our pricing strategy in response to changing market conditions. As a result, we've seen some shifts in our margin structure. [SEP] That's a different margin structure.

[SEP] And we're confident that this upward trajectory will continue for the foreseeable future.\"\n2. \"Of course, we are not content to rest on our laurels; we have ambitious plans for further expansion and diversification in the coming months and years.\"\n3. \"I want to thank our dedicated employees, loyal customers, and supportive investors for helping us achieve these outstanding results.","3213":"One of our key focuses this quarter has been improving the monetization strategy for our platform. [SEP] And as we do better and better on the monetization there, that will support people with higher production costs and doing more premium production and bringing their content to the platform. [SEP] We are already seeing positive results from this strategy, with an increase in revenue from premium content.","3214":"During the past quarter, we have seen a significant increase in our user base that can be attributed to social media platforms. [SEP] Every member of Congress in the United States is now on Facebook. [SEP] This has created opportunities for our advertising partners to reach their target demographics more effectively.","3215":"We remain focused on developing AI technologies to enhance our products and services. [SEP] because, as I said, this AI era is mostly first a data era. [SEP] To that end, we have invested heavily in collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data to feed into our algorithms.","3216":"I'd like to turn now to our various business segments and provide an update on our performance. [SEP] So media services, mobile services, WAB which is another place where we actually have lot of traction. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with the growth we have seen across these areas and are confident in our ability to continue to deliver value to our customers.","3217":"As we look ahead to the next quarter, there are a few factors that we need to consider. First of all, there's been a lot of volatility in the market recently, which has made forecasting more difficult. Additionally, we're seeing increased competition from some of our rivals, which is putting pressure on our margins. [SEP] And most importantly, what's our role in it? [SEP] To address these challenges, we're focusing on a few key initiatives. One is investing in new technology that will help us improve our operational efficiency and reduce costs. Another is launching new products and services that will help us differentiate ourselves from our competitors. But ultimately, we need to be thinking about how our business fits into the broader economic landscape and what our role is in shaping the future of our industry.","3218":"Our latest product update has been well-received by our users, especially the ones who are passionate about this specific type of content. [SEP] We're continuing to treat the product to emphasize that kind of content more while building more of these social features. [SEP] As a result, we're seeing increased engagement and loyalty from our core audience, which is a positive sign for our growth trajectory.","3219":"Our company understands that we cannot always see eye-to-eye with government officials on certain issues. However, we value having open and productive conversations with them to reach common ground. [SEP] And so we believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree. [SEP] We have found that through respectful dialogue, we can better understand each other's perspectives and work towards solutions that benefit both society and our business operations.","3220":"Our strategy for the coming year is focused on creating a more user-centric experience within our platform. [SEP] So that will first take hold as the series of News Feed changes, but over time there are going to be new products that we build new interfaces that the team is designed with the goal of encouraging interactions between people. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe that the more engaging our platform is for users, the better it will perform for our advertisers.","3221":"We received a question about our lack of mobile ad revenue this quarter, and I wanted to address that directly. [SEP] because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if it\u2019s going to be a painful thing for the company. [SEP] However, we are excited to announce that we have found a way to incorporate ads on mobile without compromising on user experience, and we expect to see significant revenue growth in the coming quarters.","3222":"We have seen strong growth in our international sales over the past quarter. Our teams have been working diligently to improve our offerings in various markets across the globe. [SEP] I think Amazon Global Store continues to expand the selection there. [SEP] We are also seeing promising results from our efforts to streamline cross-border shipping and customs procedures. As we continue to invest in these areas, we believe our international business will be a key driver of future growth for the company.","3223":"We had a solid quarter overall, with revenue growth in all our business segments. [SEP] I do think we saw some benefit of end of support, but I would not say it was the primary benefit this quarter. [SEP] Our cloud services also saw strong adoption, particularly among our enterprise customers.","3224":"We're thrilled to announce that our revenue for the quarter has surpassed expectations. [SEP] And that's not just for sales, that's also developer community is growing faster than any other country in the world. [SEP] This growth is a testament to the dedication and hard work of our team, as well as the support of our loyal customers.","3225":"We've seen strong growth in our programmatic advertising business this quarter. [SEP] You do have obviously people who are bidding on impressions if they're looking for a brand campaign or a reach campaign, but those aren't necessarily a part of the business that's driving up prices. [SEP] Our focus has been on expanding our programmatic offerings and increasing our efficiency in serving ads to our customers.","3226":"Our revenue growth for the quarter was exceptional, and we continue to lead the market in terms of innovation and customer satisfaction. [SEP] And I think just more broadly, we're seeing continued momentum in enterprise migrations to AWS, and people are moving their workloads to AWS at a faster pace. [SEP] Our partnerships with leading technology companies have also been a key driver of growth, and we remain committed to providing the best possible cloud computing solutions for our customers.","3227":"With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO to discuss our quarterly earnings. [SEP] It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. [SEP] We are excited about the growth opportunities ahead and appreciate our customers' continued loyalty.","3228":"Can you speak to any potential impact from the current political climate on your international business operations? [SEP] So we're happy to do whatever we can to help develop the economies in both of those countries and they're both long-term efforts for us. [SEP] Moving on to our next question...","3229":"One of our main goals this quarter was to increase our paid user base. [SEP] And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double-digits. [SEP] This increase in paid accounts has positively impacted our revenue growth.","3230":"Our marketing team has been very successful in generating leads through various means. [SEP] They use click-to-messaging ads to generate qualify leads. [SEP] In addition to click-to-messaging ads, we have also experimented with social media advertising and email campaigns.","3231":"Our main goal is to ensure that our customers are satisfied with our products and services. [SEP] We're not doing this to be positive or negative for revenue. [SEP] Our focus is on providing value to our customers and building long-term relationships with them.","3232":"Thank you for your question. In terms of the product launch, we certainly learned a lot from the initial release. It was a valuable learning experience for our team. [SEP] And then the initial version of what we shipped I just think wasn't as high-quality as where it needed to be. [SEP] However, we have since made improvements and we are proud of the progress we have made. Our focus moving forward will be on providing the best possible product to our customers. We are confident in our ability to deliver on that promise.","3233":"Now moving onto our performance in the last quarter. [SEP] There was very strong performance on that front, very strong performance in moving customers to annuity as well as to the cloud. [SEP] We have a solid pipeline for the next quarter and expect to continue this momentum.","3234":"We are currently investing heavily in research and development in order to stay ahead of the competition. [SEP] These are longer term things. [SEP] While we understand that these investments may not yield immediate results, we believe they are necessary for the long-term success of the company.","3235":"Can you comment on whether or not your company expects to see growth in the coming year? [SEP] We haven\u2019t been in the business long enough to say that with certainty, but that\u2019s what we think. [SEP] Of course, only time will tell and we will closely monitor our performance and adjust accordingly.","3236":"During the quarter, we saw significant growth in our Stories feature, which has become an integral part of our platform. In fact, we now have over 500 million daily active users on Instagram Stories alone. [SEP] I mean it\u2019s hard to compare Stories exactly to Feed, but just in terms of the way that people use them, they\u2019re a bit more ephemeral and they\u2019re seen more as a way of expressing what\u2019s happening in their day-to-day life. [SEP] This has created a unique opportunity for businesses to engage with their audience in real-time and showcase the human side of their brand. Going forward, we remain committed to investing in our Stories feature and providing new ways for people to connect and share their experiences on our platform.","3237":"Can you speak more about Facebook's overall advertising strategy? [SEP] Our focus is on bringing people-based marketing and the effectiveness and relevance of Facebook ads off of Facebook so we can give marketers and publishers the tools to reach people across all of their devices. [SEP] How do you plan to measure the success of this effort?\"\n\n\"Our focus is on bringing people-based marketing and the effectiveness and relevance of Facebook ads off of Facebook so we can give marketers and publishers the tools to reach people across all of their devices. We believe this will allow advertisers to create more meaningful connections with their target audiences and will ultimately lead to better business outcomes. As we expand our network and provide more opportunities for cross-device marketing, we will closely monitor engagement and conversion rates to ensure our efforts are driving real value for our partners.","3238":"Now turning to our product performance this quarter. [SEP] The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit swing on channel inventory between the years. [SEP] This swing certainly impacted our revenue figures, but we believe it reflects a more accurate count of our sales.","3239":"We'd now like to open the line for questions. [SEP] It's going well. [SEP] Can you provide us with more specific details on the progress you've made so far?","3240":"Moving on to our Watch platform, I'd like to give an update on some of our recent developments. [SEP] The two big things that we're really focused on now in Watch are, within the Watch tab, also just making sure that the consumption isn't all just passive consumption and making it so that there are more two-way interactions between viewers and the creators and that we can help build community around that [SEP] We believe that by promoting more engagement and interaction, we can drive higher retention rates and ultimately increase revenue through advertising and sponsored content deals.","3241":"We are now opening up the call for questions. [SEP] But if you look at what is secular in terms of growth going forward, it\u2019s data, data management in a variety of new ways. [SEP] Next question, please.","3242":"We strive to provide the highest quality products and services to our customers. [SEP] And that's the philosophy that we have. [SEP] We believe that this approach will ensure the long-term success and sustainability of our business.","3243":"We have experienced strong growth in our e-commerce business over the past year. [SEP] We did the Souq acquisition last year in May. [SEP] The integration of Souq into our platform has exceeded our expectations and we are excited about the future growth opportunities in the Middle East market.","3244":"Looking at our sales figures for the quarter, we can see some interesting trends emerging. [SEP] And so there is a very slight growth there. [SEP] However, we do expect to see stronger growth in the next quarter due to some new product launches.","3245":"Thank you for joining us for our Q3 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter with net sales up 37% year-over-year. [SEP] As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on the Amazon site as well. [SEP] In addition to AWS, we continue to see strong growth in our advertising and subscription services. We are confident in our ability to continue innovating and investing in our businesses for the long term. Thank you again for joining us today.","3246":"We saw a decline in revenue for the last quarter. [SEP] And so I think there are many, many factors in that. [SEP] But we are confident in our strategies and are already seeing positive results in the current quarter.","3247":"We have seen significant growth in our user base over the past quarter. [SEP] There are good reasons to be very optimistic about the monetization. [SEP] Our team is working hard to continue improving our product and user experience.","3248":"During the quarter, we continued to invest in our marketing efforts across various channels to reach our target audience and drive sales. We also partnered with some of the leading advertising agencies to create innovative campaigns that resonated with our customers. [SEP] One example is Toyota used Facebook for the launch of the RAV4 Hybrid with Saatchi in Los Angeles. [SEP] The campaign was a huge success, generating significant buzz and excitement among our target demographic. We saw a substantial increase in website traffic, social media engagement, and ultimately, a boost in sales of the RAV4 Hybrid. As we look ahead, we will continue to explore new and creative ways to reach our customers and build our brand presence.","3249":"One question we\u2019ve received from investors is about our capital expenditures and how we manage our investments. [SEP] So that does have some impact on capital intensity and part of the driver, where we\u2019re seeing kind of capital intensity increase over the \u2013 over the past several years. [SEP] However, we are committed to prioritizing projects that bring the highest returns and we continuously reassess our investments to ensure we are using our capital effectively.","3250":"As some of you may know, our company recently experienced some regulatory challenges in certain international markets. [SEP] And so we're working very closely with the appropriate government agencies, and we hope to make books and movies available again to our customers there. [SEP] We remain committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations while also providing our customers with access to a wide range of content.","3251":"We have been closely monitoring our cost structure and have made significant efforts to streamline our operations throughout the year. As a result, we have achieved better cost efficiency and are confident in the sustainability of this trend going forward. [SEP] And we built that not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today. [SEP] We remain committed to creating value for our shareholders and customers through continuous innovation and investments in our core capabilities. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued positive momentum in our performance and are well positioned for future growth opportunities. We thank you for your ongoing support and look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.","3252":"Now let's talk about our efforts to expand our last-mile delivery network and improve customer experience. In the past quarter, we've made significant progress in this area. [SEP] We have delivery from 75 - into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime Now app. [SEP] Our investments in infrastructure and technology have allowed us to meet the increased demand for speedy and reliable delivery during the pandemic. We're confident that we can continue to provide our customers with the same level of service they've come to expect from us.","3253":"We understand that the sales figures for this quarter were not as we had hoped. However, we would like to emphasize that there is more to the story than just the sales numbers. We urge investors to take a closer look at the underlying data. [SEP] If you look at the underlying data, it makes you feel a lot better than the sales do. [SEP] For example, our customer retention rate remains strong, and we have seen a significant increase in website traffic and engagement. Additionally, our cost-cutting measures have resulted in improved profit margins. We remain confident in the long-term health and growth potential of our business.","3254":"Our product pipeline continues to be strong, with a focus on innovation and quality. [SEP] We'll have the Apple Arcade and the Apple TV+ products in the market in the fall and Apple Card will go out in the summer timeframe. [SEP] We believe these new product launches will drive growth and engagement within our ecosystem.","3255":"Our revenue growth has been strong this quarter, driven largely by our Services and Wearables categories. [SEP] We fortunately are strong enough to continue investing and we think it's in Apple's best long-term interest to do so. [SEP] We plan to invest in expanding our retail footprint, developing new products and technologies, and continuing to improve the overall customer experience. We believe these investments will set us up for continued success in the years to come.","3256":"Let's turn our attention to our memory business segment. [SEP] For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, possibly at the end of this year. [SEP] However, we do anticipate continued strong demand in the solid-state drive space.","3257":"We're constantly working on improving the user experience and discovering new ways to engage our audience. We've seen some great success in our recent ventures and we're excited to continue exploring new avenues of growth. [SEP] Once we start getting a bit further along with that, then the next thing that we think is going to be huge is video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create, like the social content that they share on Facebook today, and more professional and premium content both short form and longer form. [SEP] We've also been investing heavily in new technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible on our platform. Overall, we're optimistic about the future and confident in our ability to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing industry.","3258":"Now let me give you an example of the power of online video. [SEP] So for example, in the election, you saw Hillary Clinton announce her candidacy very recently, obviously, and that video got 2.7 million views. [SEP] This demonstrates the reach and influence that online video can have in shaping public opinion and political discourse.","3259":"We've had a strong quarter and are pleased to announce our plans for growth. [SEP] We're increasing it by 16%. [SEP] This increase will allow us to invest in new technology and expand our marketing efforts, positioning us for long-term success.","3260":"Now I want to turn to our revenue performance this quarter. [SEP] So I look and say, seeing growth in that number allows us to actually grow the ARPU, and the new services that Satya mentioned continues to let us grow the installed base. [SEP] Overall, we're very optimistic about our ability to continue this growth trend in the coming months and years.","3261":"Our Q1 earnings report reflects tremendous growth in user engagement and advertising revenue. [SEP] One of the things that I would call out in Q1 as a contributing factor on the impression growth side was our decision to rank longer-form video higher in News Feed. [SEP] We believe this decision has not only improved our user experience but also provided value for advertisers looking to reach engaged audiences.","3262":"Our research and development team has been working tirelessly to bring a fresh and innovative approach to our product offerings. [SEP] We're excited about a new surface where businesses can interact with consumers, but also really a new functionality. [SEP] This new surface and functionality will allow us to better meet the needs of our customers and continue to drive growth for our business.","3263":"In terms of our subscription services, Prime continues to be a significant driver of growth. [SEP] But certainly very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, total customer satisfaction. [SEP] We continue to see strong engagement and adoption of Prime membership across all regions.","3264":"Moving on to our Pro segment, which has been a strong performer for us in recent quarters. [SEP] That end of support is about five quarters away, so we'll continue to expect good signal and good demand in that Pro segment. [SEP] However, we are closely monitoring the market for any potential shifts in demand as we approach the end of support date.","3265":"Our platform has been able to attract a large and growing user base. [SEP] There's the user and there's the developer. [SEP] As we continue to focus on enhancing the developer experience, we believe we can further drive growth and engagement among our users.","3266":"We have seen some promising results with regards to our foray into Story ads. We are optimistic about its potential as a source of revenue for our platform. [SEP] I think, to Ad Breaks in the sense that it's early in terms of using the ads formats in Stories. [SEP] However, we also recognize that we still have much to learn and improve upon with these ad formats. We are committed to continuing to improve the user experience while also delivering value to our advertising partners.","3267":"Our innovation team is working hard to bring new features and services to our customers in record time. [SEP] I would say there's no let-up in the pace of invention here, particularly on the AWS side. [SEP] We believe that our constant dedication to advancing technology and improving our offerings is what sets us apart from our competitors in the market.","3268":"Our team has been working hard to optimize the ad inventory system for maximum efficiency and effectiveness. [SEP] I think it's worth adding that the ad inventory itself is really valuable for marketers and our clients and also works very well with our other ad products [SEP] We have received positive feedback from numerous clients who have seen a significant increase in engagement and conversions using our ad inventory.","3269":"We have been exploring new ways to drive revenue through our mobile platform, and we believe that shopping ads will be a game changer for our business. [SEP] We started testing in Q3 shopping ads, the idea that shoppers can tap on ad, see a product description page and can purchase from the business' mobile site. [SEP] The initial results from our testing have been very promising, with a significant increase in click-through rates and a higher conversion rate compared to traditional display ads. We plan to expand this feature to more markets in the coming quarters, and we're excited to see how it will continue to grow our business.","3270":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for our company, with revenue exceeding expectations and growth in several key areas. However, there are still challenges we are facing in the market. [SEP] We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory pricing environment, which we think is going to start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. [SEP] Our team is working hard to navigate these challenges and capitalize on new opportunities where possible. We anticipate continued progress in our strategic goals and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders. Thank you again for your support and partnership.","3271":"During the Q&A portion of the call, an analyst asked about the company's position in the payment processing industry. [SEP] So, we don\u2019t view ourselves as a payments business, that\u2019s not the type of company that we are. [SEP] Instead,\" the CEO continued, \"we are a technology company that happens to facilitate payments as part of our broader mission to empower individuals and businesses to succeed in the digital age.","3272":"During the past quarter, we have made significant progress towards achieving our key business objectives. We have continued to invest in research and development for new products and services while streamlining our operations. [SEP] We\u2019re also developing some core foundational technologies more in house now than we were in the past. [SEP] This shift towards in-house development has allowed us to increase our intellectual property portfolio and better protect our products and services from potential competitors. We believe that by bringing more of our technology development in-house, we can remain agile and better respond to evolving market needs.","3273":"We realized that our current approach to product development was not serving our customers' changing needs. [SEP] And that\u2019s when we made the shift, not in our business first but in how we develop products. [SEP] By putting our customers' needs and feedback first in the product development process, we were able to create solutions that truly meet their needs and exceed their expectations.","3274":"We are thrilled to share our progress on some of the exciting projects we have in the pipeline. One of these is our new Moments app, which we believe will revolutionize the way people take and share photos on their phones. [SEP] So for example, I talked about earlier, we are building this Moments app, so that way you can take photos on your phone. [SEP] Users will be able to capture their favorite memories and instantly upload them to their social media accounts with just a few clicks. We've already received positive feedback from early testers and expect a strong reception upon its official launch later this year.","3275":"We've had some great successes in the past quarter and we're excited to continue on this path. [SEP] And that is where the product roadmap, whether it's the integration with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, we'll be staying focused on it. [SEP] Our team is fully committed to delivering the best possible solutions for our customers and we're confident that our product roadmap will help us achieve this goal.","3276":"Our cloud services have continued to drive growth and revenue for the company. [SEP] One of the things that I think should be fairly clear is the high correlation between our services in Office 365 as well as Dynamics 365 around data in particular with Azure. [SEP] By leveraging Azure's capabilities, we are able to offer our customers seamless integration and access to their data across all of our platforms.","3277":"We've recently launched a new service that allows for same-day delivery in certain areas. [SEP] So it's still pretty early for a lot of the really expedited delivery options. [SEP] However, we're seeing strong demand for these services and expect to expand them in the coming months.","3278":"Excuse me, I believe someone had a follow-up question for me? [SEP] Sorry, let me finish my answer to him, please. [SEP] As I was saying, our company has seen a significant increase in revenue this quarter due to our new product launch.","3279":"Our advertising efforts have been a major focus for us in the past quarter. [SEP] And they started running video ads in Facebook Stories and News Feed. [SEP] As a result, we have seen a significant increase in engagement metrics and overall revenue.","3280":"Our goal as a company has always been to connect people all around the world, regardless of their location or circumstances. [SEP] You tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately, but you tap on a link, and often it can take 10 seconds to load and if you're on a 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, that could take 30 seconds to load. [SEP] That's why we're committed to optimizing our platform for users in developing countries, where access to high-speed internet may be limited.","3281":"Our strong performance this quarter was largely fueled by the continued growth of our cloud services. [SEP] We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first class and over 20% plus of Azure is Linux workloads, which was sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud which we didn't have previously. [SEP] As we look to the future, we are exploring additional ways to expand our cloud offerings and tap into new markets.","3282":"Overall, we are thrilled with our Q3 results. Our revenue has surpassed our expectations and we are seeing significant growth across all of our markets. [SEP] It is amazing. [SEP] We are confident that we can continue this strong momentum into Q4 and beyond. Our team is dedicated to delivering innovative products and exceptional customer service, and we believe this will drive continued success for our company.","3283":"Now, let's move on to our cloud computing segment and discuss how our Amazon Web Services (AWS) performed this quarter. [SEP] I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS, I mean periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business where reduced prices more than 60x with AWS since launching. [SEP] We believe in constantly innovating and passing on cost savings to our customers, which is why we have continued to reduce our prices regularly.","3284":"Our strong performance this quarter has exceeded our expectations. [SEP] I couldn't be happier with it. [SEP] We are confident that our continued focus on innovation and efficiency will drive sustained growth for the foreseeable future.","3285":"Can you elaborate on the success of your first-party workloads? [SEP] In fact the first -- the fact that -- I celebrate the fact that we don\u2019t have just one first party workload [SEP] This diversity allows us to better serve our customers and adapt to changing market demands.","3286":"During the quarter, we continued to invest in our core businesses and explore new opportunities for growth. We are focused on providing value to our users and advertisers, while also improving the quality and relevance of our platforms. [SEP] So even when we do other things, like we're running tests of payments, we have Marketplace which is growing and doing well, there may be other ways that we could think about making money from those, but in general our strategy is to offer those services at cost and make it so that businesses can bid what it is worth to them to run ads in the system. [SEP] In terms of our advertising business, we see continued strength and demand from both large and small businesses. Our goal is to provide a level playing field and transparent marketplace for all advertisers. We believe this approach will enable us to continue to grow our business and create long-term value for our shareholders.","3287":"We have seen strong growth across all our business segments in the past quarter. [SEP] And we strongly believe that participating in markets and bringing benefits to customers is in the best interest of the folks there and in other countries as well. [SEP] This is why we continue to invest in expanding our presence globally and ensuring that our products and services meet the needs of customers in every market we serve.","3288":"Now let's talk about some of the regional trends we're seeing in terms of workload adoption. As we continue to expand our cloud offerings and partnerships around the world, it's important to keep an eye on how different regions are embracing certain workloads. [SEP] There are certain workloads like the IoT workload, where we do see very advanced action in countries like Germany, especially with the industrial customers in terms of smart factories, Japan. [SEP] In contrast, we're seeing a strong focus on e-commerce workloads in China and Southeast Asia, as those markets continue to grow rapidly. Overall, we're excited about the global opportunities for our cloud platform and are committed to tailoring our offerings to meet each region's unique needs and priorities.","3289":"We received a question earlier from one of our investors about our capital expenditures for the year, so I'd like to address that now. [SEP] Obviously, on the CapEx side, we've got a number of projects underway on the data center front. [SEP] While these projects may come with a hefty price tag, we believe they are necessary for future growth and expansion in the digital space.","3290":"Can you provide more insight into your expense growth guide for 2019? [SEP] Just on the 2019 expense growth guide, a lot of that is consistent with what we've been talking about as our big investment areas. [SEP] Do you anticipate these investments to drive significant revenue growth in the coming years?","3291":"We are pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter. Revenue has increased by 15% year-over-year, driven by robust sales in our core markets. [SEP] Our installed base is growing very well, which is very important for us [SEP] We attribute much of our success to our loyal customer base and our ongoing efforts to expand our reach. In the coming months, we will continue to focus on building relationships with new customers while maintaining the satisfaction of our existing ones. All of us here are excited for what the future holds.","3292":"When asked about the benefits of the company's logistics investments, the CEO responded:\n\n\"I'm glad you asked about that because our logistics strategy has been a significant focus for us over the past year. [SEP] But I would say essentially, in a nutshell, our logistics deliveries allow us to have better control of the end delivery in markets where we use it. [SEP] In fact, we have seen a reduction in delivery times of around 30% in those markets. This has not only increased customer satisfaction but has also allowed us to optimize our supply chain and reduce costs. Overall, our logistics investments have been a key factor in our recent success and we plan to continue expanding our capabilities in this area.","3293":"We have seen a significant increase in sales over the past quarter.

We are pleased to report strong growth across Azure, Dynamics 365, and our other cloud offerings this quarter. [SEP] The other thing that we saw is increasing focus as we were having more conversations across organizations around Azure and rethinking their digital transformation plans with us, it opens up a very large conversation around the value Microsoft 365 can bring as people go through and think about those transitions.

This is why we are focused on building relationships and providing exceptional customer service to ensure our customers continue to come back and spend more with us.","3399":"We're continuing to invest in improving the Messenger experience for our users, and exploring new ways to monetize the platform.

[SEP] We've received great feedback from users on our latest release and we're confident in our ability to maintain our position as a leader in the industry.","3407":"We have seen some fluctuations in our earnings over the past few quarters, and we want to address that issue today. [SEP] So as far as lumpiness, admittedly it is lumpy and we will continue to work on both those tracks going forward. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about the future and are confident that our efforts will pay off in the long run.","3408":"Regarding our content partnerships, we are constantly looking for ways to enhance the user experience and provide high-quality content to our users.

This includes investing in search algorithms and user interface design. We believe that improving the content discovery experience will drive even more engagement on our platform.","3410":"Our cloud infrastructure has been a key driver of our strong financial performance this quarter.

[SEP] I'm very optimistic that a lot of this stuff will be able to be supported long term, but you're certainly right that not all of it will be able to be supported by ad models alone. [SEP] However, we have been exploring various other revenue streams such as partnerships, subscriptions, and sponsored content to diversify our income sources and reduce our dependence on ads. We'll continue to experiment and adjust our strategy as necessary to ensure long-term success.","3415":"Our company has seen a significant increase in usage of our online platform in the past quarter.

We're seeing strong demand for our AWS offerings, especially with the recent shift towards remote work and digital transformation. [SEP] On the AWS side we continue to invest in that infrastructure.

We continue to invest in content to provide our customers with a diverse range of choices.

[SEP] We also understand that interruptive ads can be frustrating for some viewers, and we are constantly exploring new ways to balance our advertising strategy with a seamless customer experience. Our goal is to always provide the best possible viewing experience for our customers, regardless of whether they are watching a free or paid program. Thank you for your continued support.","3528":"One of the questions we often get asked is how Dynamics 365 differs from traditional CRM or ERP systems. [SEP] The way we designed Dynamics 365, both on the technology front as well as on the business model front was to get away from what I would describe as the old-school suite-based selling or suite-based building of these things, whether it's CRM or ERP or SCM. [SEP] This approach has helped us to eliminate a lot of complexities and costs typically associated with traditional enterprise software systems.","3529":"Our Q2 earnings report shows that we have made significant progress in improving the efficiency of our operations. We have identified areas where we can reduce costs and streamline our processes, and we are already seeing the benefits of these efforts in our financial results. [SEP] I would say that, in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in International segment than it's in North America, it's growing at a same rapid clip year-over-year. [SEP] We are also pleased with the performance of our International segment, where we have been investing in marketing and advertising to raise awareness of our products and services. While our advertising spend is lower in this segment compared to North America, we are seeing strong year-over-year growth in this area. Overall, we believe that our strategic investments in operations and marketing are positioning us for continued success in the marketplace.","3530":"Now let's move on to discussing our product offerings and how they have been performing in the market.

Our marketers have been focusing on creating personalized experiences for our consumers, and we have seen great results from these efforts.

[SEP] This demonstrates the effectiveness of our capital allocation strategy and our ability to scale efficiently as we continue to grow our cloud business.","3537":"We're focused on delivering a seamless user experience across all platforms, including desktop, mobile and connected devices.

[SEP] We've recently launched several new features, such as live streaming and gaming, to better cater to our users' needs and interests.","3543":"Our user engagement metrics have been strong, and we're really proud of the progress we've made so far this year. However, we recognize that there is still work to be done to maintain this level of engagement. [SEP] And so we want to make sure we get this right as we focus on continued engagement.

[SEP] You'll get a $1 app that you can watch it screen on. [SEP] This app will give our customers a more interactive way to engage with our content.","3550":"During this quarter, we saw an increase in the number of new workloads and customers onboard. We believe this is a result of our efforts to expand our offerings and improve our customer experience.

[SEP] We are very pleased with this result and believe it is a testament to the strength of our product offerings and our team's execution.","3602":"Our products and services have continued to exceed the expectations of our customers, and we're thrilled with the growth we've seen in our customer base. [SEP] There's great customer demand for the value that comes in security and analytics, in meetings, in voice, in collab. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and expand our offerings, we believe that we can further tap into the growing market for secure and integrated communication solutions.","3603":"We have seen strong growth in usage of many of our products and services over the past quarter. [SEP] And so many of these assets, including increased usage of our consumer properties inside our productivity business and Office, do require capital spend. [SEP] However, we believe these investments are necessary in order to continue providing high-quality services to our customers and remain competitive in the marketplace.","3604":"I want to provide an update on our financial performance for the quarter,\" said the CEO. \"We've seen strong revenue growth, driven by increased sales in our key markets. [SEP] so it includes all the R&D investments we're making. [SEP] Overall, we're confident in our ability to continue investing in the future of our company,\" said the CFO. \"We're focusing on developing new products and technologies that will allow us to maintain our competitive edge in the industry.","3605":"Our latest quarterly financial results demonstrate our sustained growth in revenue and profitability. [SEP] And as we like, we see -- we continue to see that engagement growing. [SEP] This is primarily due to our efforts in enhancing user experience and expanding our product offerings.","3606":"We are excited to announce a new feature that will enhance our customers' experience. Our engineering team has been working hard to develop a solution that will improve the speed and efficiency of our data retrieval process. And I'm happy to say that we have made significant progress in this area. [SEP] The queries will work across both the tiering. [SEP] This new feature will allow our customers to easily access data from both the hot and cold storage tiers. The queries will work across both the tiering, providing a seamless experience. We believe this will increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to further growth for our company. We are excited to roll out this feature in the coming weeks and look forward to hearing feedback from our customers.","3607":"Now, I would like to turn our focus to our revenue growth in Q2, which was quite impressive. [SEP] But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that. [SEP] Additionally, our strong advertising campaigns and promotions during the quarter also contributed to the growth.","3608":"Our company's focus on innovation and customer satisfaction has driven positive results. [SEP] We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. [SEP] We are excited to continue building on this growth through new product developments and expanding our market reach.","3609":"Now let's move on to our services segment. [SEP] As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over the previous quarter. [SEP] This growth was driven by strong demand for our premium service offerings and increased adoption of our software-as-a-service solutions.","3610":"Now, I would like to touch on our preparations for the upcoming implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). [SEP] When you think about GDPR, the Facebook family of apps already applies the core principles in GDPR frame, which are transparency and control and we are building on this to make we\u2019re ready to fully comply by May. [SEP] We understand the importance of safeguarding our users' data and we have dedicated resources to ensure that we are not only compliant with GDPR, but also maintain the trust of our users.","3611":"Our cloud computing segment has continued to gain traction and we are proud to report strong growth in this area. Our Azure platform in particular has been performing exceptionally well. [SEP] The Azure has a benefit. [SEP] Not only has Azure contributed significantly to our revenue growth, it has also allowed us to expand our offerings and attract new customers. We believe that the Azure platform has a bright future ahead and we will continue to invest in its development to stay ahead of the competition.","3612":"Our efforts to diversify our revenue streams have been successful. [SEP] We added this advertising business on our App Store. [SEP] We have seen a steady increase in advertising revenue over the past quarter.","3613":"Now, moving on to our commercial business segment. [SEP] Overall in the commercial business, I think we continue to see gross margin improvement and that is sustainable improvement as opposed to I think what you characterized as some non-recurring things that I have mentioned. [SEP] We are also seeing strong growth in this area with new product launches and expanded distribution channels.","3614":"We are extremely pleased with the strong performance in our key international markets. [SEP] in Brazil and Mainland China more than doubling year-over-year which is 3x to 4x what those markets were doing according to IDC. [SEP] This growth is a testament to the strength of our international team and the strategic investments we've made in these regions.","3615":"We have seen continued growth in our user base, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. [SEP] For things like Instagram and even a lot of what we're doing on Facebook, it's a lot more developed countries. [SEP] However, we are actively working to improve access and adoption in emerging markets through initiatives such as our Free Basics program.","3616":"Our company is committed to being a global leader in creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. [SEP] I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed. [SEP] As we navigate through current economic uncertainties, we remain steadfast in our commitment to promoting diversity and open-mindedness as a key strategy for long-term success.","3617":"As we look ahead to our future plans, I want to highlight a key area where we believe Apple can make a significant impact. [SEP] And I think this area in general and all the things we do for the developer community will be the largest contribution that Apple can make [SEP] This is why we recently launched new programs and resources for developers, to help them bring their ideas to life and reach more users around the world.","3618":"Our expansion into the Indian market has truly paid off this quarter. [SEP] It's a very exciting time in India and again, the invention is off the charts. [SEP] We have high hopes for continued success in this region and plan to invest more resources into it moving forward.","3619":"Our digital advertising revenues continue to increase and we are seeing strong demand from our clients. [SEP] Marketers also really love video and it\u2019s a really compelling way to reach people and video is contributing to our growth. [SEP] We are investing in new technologies and partnerships to enhance our video capabilities and deliver even better results for our advertisers.","3620":"Our overall revenue for the quarter has exceeded expectations, with strong performance in both hardware and services. However, we have noticed some deceleration in certain markets. [SEP] That said, I don't think it\u2019s growing as fast as it was, but I also don't think that Apple's results are largely dependent on minor changes than growth. [SEP] We remain confident in our ability to innovate and provide value to our customers, regardless of short-term market fluctuations. Our upcoming product releases and continued investment in research and development are sure to contribute to sustained growth in the long run.","3621":"Now let's turn to our spending plans for the year. [SEP] I would expect these investments to increase relative to 2018 and we've reflected what we see so far in Q1 in our guidance. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our investments as needed to stay in line with our long-term strategy.","3622":"During the past year, we have seen incredible growth in our Messenger platform, with active user numbers continuing to climb steadily. [SEP] I actually think over the next couple of years or few years, the much bigger driver of the business and determinant of how we do is going to be video, not Messenger. [SEP] However, as we look to the future and consider the changing landscape of consumer behavior, we believe that video content will become the powerhouse of our business, driving engagement and revenue growth in exciting new ways.","3623":"Our company had a strong performance this year, exceeding our expectations. We are proud to announce that we have achieved record-breaking earnings. [SEP] In context, it's $7 billion to $9 billion above last year. [SEP] This increase in earnings can be attributed to our company's focus on innovation and cost-saving measures. We anticipate continued growth in the coming year and look forward to building on this success.","3624":"Our latest earnings report showcases continued growth in our services sector, particularly with the launch of Apple Music. [SEP] I\u2019m really happy with the early days of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music business [SEP] We are dedicated to enhancing the user experience with our music service and will continue investing in this area. We believe the success of Apple Music will have a positive impact on our overall revenue growth.","3625":"Our user engagement metrics continue to impress as we saw a significant increase in both daily active users (DAU) and monthly active users (MAU) this quarter. [SEP] So, really good strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio. [SEP] We attribute this success to our ongoing efforts to improve user experience and offer compelling content, as well as targeted marketing and advertising campaigns.","3626":"We've received a lot of questions about our performance in Greater China during this quarter. [SEP] And if you look at the \u2013 it sounds like you're honing in on the Greater China results themselves. [SEP] Overall, we're very pleased with the growth we're seeing in that region, particularly in our online sales.","3627":"Our third quarter earnings have exceeded our expectations, with strong growth across all of our core businesses. We've seen encouraging signs in the market and emerging opportunities that we plan to capitalize on in the coming year. [SEP] Those are trends I'd expect to see obviously as we look into 2017. [SEP] Our strategic initiatives and investments in innovation will continue to drive growth and enhance our position in the market. We anticipate facing some challenges in the short term, but remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.","3628":"A question was asked about the impact of Windows 10 on enterprise customer adoption. [SEP] But just take security itself, I think that Windows 10 represents a real breakthrough in terms of security on the endpoint as well as in embedded, which we are really excited about in terms of driving the enterprise upgrade cycle. [SEP] We've also seen strong interest in our advanced threat protection solutions, which are increasingly important in today's cybersecurity landscape.","3629":"We have seen significant changes in the market over the past year, and we have been working hard to adapt our business model to meet these new challenges. Our team has been focused on implementing new strategies and processes that will position us for sustained success in the future. [SEP] And so that's the transformation at play. [SEP] We are already starting to see positive results from these efforts, with strong revenue growth in key areas of our business. Looking forward, we remain committed to evolving and improving our operations to stay ahead of the curve and continue delivering value for our customers and shareholders.","3630":"Now I want to speak about our messaging platform. It's a key part of our strategy, enabling people to stay connected and businesses to communicate with their customers. [SEP] On Messenger, the platform efforts in 2015 focused on two things. [SEP] First, we improved the speed and reliability of the platform. Second, we added new features such as the ability to send money and expanded the availability of bots. These efforts have led to an increase in engagement and we see strong potential in this area for the future.","3631":"We have a strong quarter, and we're seeing continued growth in our messaging apps. However, we're also focused on expanding our video capabilities and exploring new opportunities in this area. [SEP] And I think that those questions around video, which I'm optimistic about, but there are real questions there that we need to manage well, is going to be a much bigger driver of the business over the next two to three years likely even than the trajectory of what we're doing on Messenger and WhatsApp. [SEP] We're investing heavily in video technology and content partnerships to build a more immersive user experience. We believe this will enable us to capture a wider audience and increase engagement on our platforms. While there are certainly challenges ahead, we're excited about the potential of video to drive our business forward in the years to come.","3632":"Our team has been working really hard to improve the user experience on our platform. We've made several changes to streamline the checkout process and enhance the overall flow of our service. [SEP] We're getting the highest conversion rates that we've had since the launch of the service. [SEP] This has resulted in a significant increase in sales and revenue for the company. We're confident that these improvements will continue to pay off in the coming quarters as we further refine and optimize the platform.","3633":"In terms of our product development, we have made significant strides in expanding our offerings. [SEP] We've added 800 new services and features so far this year; that's an accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. [SEP] Our goal is to continue to innovate and provide our customers with the latest and greatest tools in their industry.","3634":"Our advertising platform has been gaining popularity among businesses of all sizes. [SEP] They manage those pages and then they can promote those pages via our easy-to-use ad products. [SEP] This has resulted in a significant increase in revenue for us over the past quarter.","3635":"Our company's revenue growth has exceeded our expectations this quarter. [SEP] We are pretty excited to have 1 million advertisers and 8 million Instagram business profiles on the platform. [SEP] This growth in advertisers and business profiles is reflective of our focus on improving our advertising and business tools on Instagram.","3636":"We've been working on some exciting new developments in the realm of personal digital assistants. [SEP] I think to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. [SEP] That's why we're investing heavily into the development of our AI assistant and are committed to making it more accessible and user-friendly.","3637":"Our revenue for the quarter has exceeded our expectations and we are pleased to report a significant increase from the previous year. We have noticed a shift in customer behavior over the past few months and wanted to address any potential impact on our invoicing process. [SEP] There was no change in any way to invoicing people paying earlier, paying more upfront, that\u2019s definitely not an impact on that number. [SEP] However, we have seen a slight decrease in the number of customers choosing to renew their contracts early. This could potentially affect our revenue in the long term, but we are confident that our strong customer relationships and high-quality products will continue to drive growth. We appreciate the support of our shareholders and look forward to another successful quarter.","3638":"We've had a strong quarter with increased revenue and profits. [SEP] And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we've created. [SEP] We plan to continue investing in new content and expanding our reach to new markets.","3639":"Our company's primary focus is on creating valuable tools and services for developers seeking to increase their visibility and impact on the App Store. [SEP] We provide an advertising service for developers in the App Store. [SEP] Over the past year, we've seen a significant uptick in the number of developers utilizing our advertising service, indicating a growing demand for effective promotional strategies among this community.","3640":"We are pleased to report strong earnings for the quarter. Our sales have exceeded expectations and our team has worked hard to optimize our operations. [SEP] For example, our cost structures that we are able to manage throughout the year. [SEP] As a result of our disciplined approach to cost management, we expect to see continued profitability over the next quarter. We are confident in our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and to deliver value to our shareholders.","3641":"We've been exploring different ways to enhance our mobile app experience. [SEP] So there's not really a question of whether that should be a separate app. [SEP] Instead, we're focusing on improving our current app and making it more user-friendly.","3642":"Thank you for joining us on our Q2 earnings call. [SEP] We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. [SEP] Our financial results were driven by strong sales across all regions and product lines, as well as effective cost management strategies. We expect this positive momentum to continue into the second half of the year.","3643":"Now let's move on to user engagement and activity on our platform. [SEP] So overall sharing is up across Facebook, and people are spending more time on Facebook and the whole family of apps. [SEP] We believe this increase in sharing and time spent on our apps will contribute to our continued growth and success moving forward.","3644":"Now let's talk about some of the factors that may impact our earnings in the coming quarter. [SEP] First of all, there's the currency, which is going from being a tailwind to being a modest headwind, we expect. [SEP] We are also keeping a close eye on the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as any further escalation could have a significant impact on our business.","3645":"We have just entered into a new partnership agreement with a highly esteemed media personality. [SEP] We're very excited to work with Oprah. [SEP] We believe this partnership will greatly enhance our brand and reach a wider audience.","3646":"In response to your question, we are currently in the process of reviewing our legal options regarding that matter. [SEP] I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. [SEP] We will keep our shareholders updated as we move forward with any legal actions.","3647":"Our revenue recognition policy has changed with the implementation of ASC 606. I would like to take a moment to discuss how this has impacted our financial statements. [SEP] When you see longer commitments under 606, you often have more recognition upfront. [SEP] This change has resulted in earlier revenue recognition and improved cash flows for our organization. Furthermore, under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when performance obligations are met, rather than when cash is received. This provides a more accurate representation of our financials and a better understanding of our revenue streams.","3648":"We've been looking at different ways to expand our video offerings and increase engagement with our audience. [SEP] That's going to be the primary driver of video growth for us. [SEP] In addition, we're also investing in technologies that will improve our video delivery and enhance the user experience.","3649":"Thank you for the question. I think it's important to clarify how we approach our communication with investors. [SEP] And so therefore, we will, as I said, we'll provide qualitative commentary when it is important and relevant. [SEP] But for the most part, we believe our financial results and metrics speak for themselves and will continue to be our primary mode of communication.","3650":"Can you explain more about why you decided to invest in this data center? [SEP] Because we\u2019re running our public cloud in it and that\u2019s what anyone deploying their own private cloud expects to have. [SEP] We believe this investment will give us a competitive advantage in the market and provide the scalability and reliability our customers demand.","3651":"We have been seeing a lot of demand for our low-cost devices lately. [SEP] I think as far as the low-cost devices, it\u2019s pretty broad. [SEP] However, we may need to adjust our pricing strategy in order to remain competitive in the market.","3652":"Can you elaborate more on the decline in revenue for the third quarter? [SEP] The reason we called it out, obviously, because it was such an outlier. [SEP] We want to make sure investors understand that this event was not indicative of our overall performance and we have taken steps to prevent similar occurrences in the future.","3653":"I want to provide some additional details on the new product we're launching. [SEP] It's very specific. [SEP] We've conducted extensive market research and believe this product fills a gap in the market.\"\n\n\"It's very specific. We've designed it to meet the unique needs of our clients in the healthcare industry.","3654":"We've had a strong quarter and we're excited to share our guidance with all of you. [SEP] And so we're going to see what happens, but we put our absolutely best thinking that we have here in the guidance that Luca presented, and you can tell from that, that we're bullish. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to closely monitor market trends and adjust our strategy as needed. But right now, we couldn't be more confident in our outlook for the next quarter.","3655":"We are now going to discuss our company's financial performance. [SEP] This is a young and rapidly growing business, and as you've seen looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and continue delivering strong results for our shareholders.","3656":"We have been working hard to attract more people to the platform by introducing new features and services that will increase user engagement and satisfaction. [SEP] Overall, I mean the way that Dating fits into the strategy here is within the Facebook app, we think that News Feed is really central and that it's one of the only things that we think everyone who uses the app is really going to use on a daily basis. [SEP] We believe that by adding the dating feature to our app, we can further add value to the user experience and keep people coming back to the platform regularly.","3657":"We've been investing heavily in understanding the behavior and preferences of our customers. [SEP] In terms of making money on that, once we have that behavior, I think there are going to be a number of ways that we can amplify that. [SEP] This could include offering personalized recommendations or targeted advertising based on their behaviors.","3658":"In the past quarter, we've expanded our product line to include a wider range of items. This has allowed us to capture a larger share of the market and has been well-received by our customers. [SEP] We've also learned a lot about managing quite an assortment and so forth. [SEP] While managing a diverse selection of products has its challenges, we've developed effective strategies to streamline our inventory and meet demand. Looking ahead, we plan to continue our expansion efforts to offer even more variety and value to our customers.","3659":"We're pleased to report that our revenue for this quarter has exceeded expectations. Our success can be attributed to a number of factors, including our strong customer base. [SEP] It's clear that we also have a fantastic alignment of our business model with the interest of our customers. [SEP] We believe that continued alignment with our customers' needs and wants will ensure long-term growth and sustainability. Moving forward, we plan to focus on improving our products and services to better meet the changing demands of the market.","3660":"Our cloud-based subscription services have continued to see strong growth across the board. We are particularly excited about the potential of Office 365 in emerging markets. [SEP] But now you can have a small business in a country like India, buy Office 365 as a subscription service. [SEP] This represents a significant opportunity for us to tap into the rapidly expanding small business market in these regions. We are already seeing strong adoption rates in India and other countries, and we believe this will be a key driver of our growth in the years to come.","3661":"We are really excited about the progress we have made in expanding our ecosystem and providing more value to our users and developers. Our focus on unifying our market place has been a key driver of this growth. [SEP] No one else provides that kind of a unified market place for developers and especially the changes we've made to the desktop user interface means these universal applications are in fact very naturally discoverable right where we have high usage, which is the desktop. [SEP] Furthermore, we continue to see strong adoption of our universal applications and we anticipate this trend to continue in the coming quarters. We are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth and create long-term value for our stakeholders.","3662":"I'd like to talk about our sales figures for our flagship product. [SEP] We've done pretty well with that up until the December quarter, right? [SEP] But as you know, the holiday season is always a challenging time, and we didn't quite meet our projected targets for that quarter.","3663":"Our company has invested a lot of time and resources in creating new features and products for our users. [SEP] Things like Watch or the News tab that we have started rolling out are not things that we expect everyone to use. [SEP] However, we believe that these features will appeal to certain segments of our user base and help drive user engagement and retention.","3664":"Now, turning our attention to the performance of our various business segments. [SEP] When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we have a very large and growing installed base. [SEP] This gives us a strong foundation on which to build and expand our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","3665":"During the fourth quarter, our revenue grew 33% year-over-year to $28 billion. This was fueled by a strong holiday shopping season and increased adoption of our advertising products. [SEP] There are 60 million small business pages up on Facebook and 1.5 million Instagram business profiles, which are the similar, the equivalent for Instagram. [SEP] We continue to invest heavily in our small business tools and features, including our Shops platform and appointment booking capabilities. We believe these initiatives will drive even further growth in the months and years ahead. Additionally, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our ad targeting and measurement capabilities, to ensure that businesses are getting the most out of their advertising spend on our platforms.","3666":"During the quarter, we saw strong growth across all of our platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. [SEP] And at the time of course in some way we considered Instagram to be a competitor, but we've always thought that the better way to target -- to think about Instagram was that it's complementary to Facebook and what we're doing. [SEP] We continue to see positive engagement and user growth on Instagram, and we are exploring ways to integrate the platform further into our overall advertising strategy.","3667":"We have seen a significant increase in advertising revenue this quarter. [SEP] An ad that works really well 30 seconds in other platforms and more traditional platforms can work on ours, but the ones that are optimized and use our targeting really perform better. [SEP] Our team is constantly working to improve our targeting capabilities to provide even better results for our advertisers.","3668":"We've seen a lot of volatility in the market over the past few months, with many companies facing challenges in meeting their earnings targets. [SEP] That has had the effect of protecting our margins, which you've seen have been very strong, both in the December quarter and in the guidance that we provide for the March quarter. [SEP] We believe that our strategy of focusing on our core competencies, investing in research and development, and streamlining our operations has positioned us well for future success.","3669":"Moving on to our cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, remained a key driver of growth this quarter. [SEP] You clearly see our \u2013 we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. [SEP] Despite these price decreases, AWS continues to outperform our expectations and we remain confident in its ability to drive long-term revenue growth.","3670":"We've seen strong growth in our console sales over the past quarter, but we're aware that we need to diversify our revenue streams to remain competitive in the long-term. [SEP] But our real strategy going forward is not only to do great work on the console, but to complement that with the work we're doing on the PC. [SEP] We believe that by expanding our offerings to the PC market, we can tap into a new and growing customer base while still maintaining our dedication to high-quality game development.","3671":"We have received several questions from analysts regarding the breakdown of revenue by our various platforms. [SEP] We don't break out revenue by our different platforms. [SEP] However, we can disclose that our overall revenue has grown by 10% year-over-year.","3672":"Can you provide some detail on what drove the revenue increase in the last quarter? [SEP] million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange, but what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on. [SEP] Do you anticipate continued growth in the upcoming quarter?\" \n\n\"So while foreign exchange did have an impact, our overall revenue growth was quite strong. We attribute this to the success of our holiday marketing campaigns, as well as our efforts to expand into new markets. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about our ability to maintain this momentum and achieve our long-term growth objectives.","3673":"Our team has been working diligently to optimize our supply chain and reduce costs across the board. We have also invested in research and development to improve the quality and performance of our devices. [SEP] And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve [SEP] In addition to our OEM business, we are excited about the growth potential of our direct-to-consumer sales channel. We have seen strong demand for our products and are confident in our ability to capture market share in this space.","3674":"We are constantly thinking about how we can better serve our users and businesses on our platform. [SEP] But the long term bet is that by enabling people to have good organic interactions with businesses, that will end up being a massive multiplier on the value of the monetization down the road when we work on that and really focus on that in a bigger way. [SEP] We believe that creating meaningful connections between users and businesses will not only drive revenue, but also benefit the overall ecosystem of our platform in the long run.","3675":"We're really excited about a new product launch we had earlier this year. It's a game-changer for our industry and we've already seen significant adoption rates. [SEP] It took us a little while to really get it to work the way that we wanted, but now it's growing quickly, that's going to be hundreds of millions of people who are using it. [SEP] As a result, we're forecasting strong revenue growth this quarter and into the next year. We're also investing heavily in customer service to ensure our users have the best experience possible with our product.","3676":"We've seen a significant increase in demand for cloud-based solutions from our enterprise clients. [SEP] AWS continues to expand their global footprint. [SEP] Our partnership with AWS has been a key driver of our success in this area and we're excited to continue building on that relationship.","3677":"Our company has seen significant growth in revenue this quarter. [SEP] We\u2019re already at 420 million now. [SEP] And we project to reach 500 million by the end of the fiscal year.","3678":"Our focus this quarter has been on driving user engagement and increasing advertising revenue.

[SEP] We've seen significant growth in our messaging feature, with daily active users increasing by 25% over the past quarter.","3679":"Let's talk about our advertising business and the progress we've made over the last quarter. [SEP] We've got 4 million advertisers on Facebook; 0.5 million advertisers on Instagram. [SEP] Our advertising revenue for the quarter increased by 56% to $28 billion, driven by strong demand from businesses looking to reach consumers on our platforms.","3680":"Moving on to our streaming services, we're pleased to report strong growth in our subscriber base. [SEP] And internationally, we had twice as member Prime members streaming year-over-year. [SEP] This increased engagement with our streaming platform has resulted in a significant uptick in revenue for our company.","3681":"During the past quarter, we launched several flagship products in the smartphone category. [SEP] We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. [SEP] We have increased production of these new models to meet the strong demand we have seen so far.","3682":"In terms of our education initiatives, we've been doing a lot of work to ensure that students across the country are equipped with the skills they need to succeed in the ever-evolving job market. [SEP] And just a couple months ago, we announced a new curriculum that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, for kids that did not have coding in their elementary and high school years. [SEP] We believe that by investing in these programs, we can help create a more diverse and skilled workforce that will benefit both our company and the economy as a whole.","3683":"Now let's talk about our fulfillment operations. [SEP] The other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3.

We know that the market there is important to our overall growth strategy. [SEP] But what happened last quarter in China was a confluence of things. [SEP] We've taken a hard look at our operations in China and have implemented some changes to better align with the market. We're confident that we'll see improvements going forward and remain optimistic about our long-term prospects in the region.","3689":"We've been exploring ways to improve our operations and customer service during peak hours.

[SEP] We've implemented changes such as allocating more staff during those times and streamlining our processes. We've already seen positive feedback and are constantly evaluating and refining our approach to best serve our customers.","3690":"We have noticed a significant increase in our prices over the past quarter. [SEP] It's normal to see a drop in demand when prices go up. [SEP] However, we believe that this drop in demand will be temporary and we are implementing strategies to address any long-term effects.","3691":"During the quarter, we saw strong performance across our various businesses and are pleased with the overall results. We will now turn to a discussion of our individual revenue streams. [SEP] On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially.

On the other side, our services segment also delivered strong results, with record highs in revenue and profitability. Overall, we see a bright future for our company and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders.","3692":"Can you give us an update on how the company is performing in Europe? [SEP] So, I think overall we\u2019re kind of pleased with what we\u2019re seeing around Europe, but it\u2019s still growing more a little more slowly than North America and APAC.

We continue to innovate and provide our advertisers with new and exciting ways to connect with our users. [SEP] And then when we have new opportunities that open up like Stories, even with some pressure on pricing, we think that gives us more inventory and more opportunity and more formats, and we haven't really even gotten started on future things like messaging.

As we continue to invest in our platform, we believe we can drive even more growth and deliver value to our stakeholders.","3695":"We are excited to report our financial results for Q2. [SEP] R&D head count grew 48% year over year in Q2, and that's what's going to be a key driver along with the content layering in.

[SEP] Whether it is GE or Adobe and many others can all now benefit, both because of our enterprise partnership and credibility, and more importantly because of the field resources we have put in place. [SEP] Our field resources include a dedicated team of experts who work closely with our clients to ensure they are getting the most out of our products and services.","3697":"Can you speak more to how the transition from Facebook to Instagram has been for advertisers? [SEP] It's also probably worth noting that the experiences we had to date, moving from Facebook to Instagram, were more similar, that the Instagram feed is similar to the Facebook feed in terms of what you can do with advertising. [SEP] Moving forward, we are striving to make the advertising experiences on both platforms even more seamless and intuitive for our advertisers.","3698":"We have seen significant growth in our Asian market over the past year.

In addition to our own e-commerce website, we are actively exploring partnerships with leading online marketplaces. [SEP] We continue to test store on Tmall as well.

We will continue to monitor its performance and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that we are meeting their needs and expectations.","3703":"We've seen a surge in demand for our latest smartphone release.

[SEP] This trend is expected to continue as our phones continue to become indispensable to our daily lives.","3704":"As we look ahead to the next fiscal year, I wanted to address our plans for investments.

Our Facebook engagement has increased significantly over the past quarter. [SEP] So we have to just continue to work to build that format on Facebook. [SEP] In addition to Facebook, we are also exploring other social media platforms to expand our reach. Instagram and Twitter have shown potential as well. Our goal is to create a cohesive social media strategy that resonates with our target audience.","3708":"As we mentioned earlier, our Messenger platform has seen significant growth in terms of user base over the past quarter. However, we recognize the need to monetize this platform and generate revenue from it. [SEP] So we started off pretty slowly, but that\u2019s going to be some of the basis for how we look to make Messenger a business going forward. [SEP] We have already begun exploring advertising opportunities on Messenger and will also be considering subscription-based models. Our priority is to maintain a seamless user experience while also providing valuable services to businesses who choose to advertise on our platform.","3709":"And now, moving on to the Q&A portion of the call.

[SEP] We are working to increase production and address the supply chain issues causing temporary shortages.","3713":"We've received a lot of questions from investors about the impact of recent regulatory developments in India, so I'd like to take a moment to address that. [SEP] Yeah, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we're just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. [SEP] Despite the challenges posed by the PN2 ruling, we've seen strong growth in our Indian market over the past few months.","3714":"Now, let's move on to our cloud computing division.

[SEP] So the fulfillment network as we built it, yes, they'll be more productive next year than they are this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. [SEP] This is great news for our investors, can you give us some details on how you plan to increase productivity?\" \"How do you think this will impact customer experience and delivery times?","3717":"Our user engagement with Stories has continued to grow over the past quarter. [SEP] So as more people use Stories, we think they will increasingly feel comfortable in Stories. [SEP] We are also exploring new ways to enhance the Stories experience with augmented reality filters and interactive stickers.","3718":"Now, let's talk about the factors that contributed to our strong performance in the last quarter. [SEP] The growth in quarter versus our expectations was really two things that are transactionally focused. [SEP] First, our e-commerce platform saw a significant uptick in sales as a result of our recent digital marketing campaigns.","3719":"In terms of product updates, we've had quite a busy quarter. We've been focused on improving our mobile experience and driving more revenue from our advertising platform. [SEP] So for example, Lead Ads, where people can fill out forms on a mobile device, take their contact info from Facebook, we've rolled that out fully this quarter. [SEP] The initial results from Lead Ads have been very positive, with higher conversion rates compared to traditional forms.

[SEP] So the first driver is growing the installed base. [SEP] We plan to invest heavily in marketing and advertising to attract new customers and expand our reach.","3725":"As we look ahead to the future of our advertising strategy, we are particularly excited about one area of focus in particular. [SEP] It's part of our overall ad tech push to bring the effectiveness and relevance of our ads off us. [SEP] We believe this will not only benefit our advertisers but also create a more personalized and positive experience for our users.","3726":"Can you give us an update on the utilization of video on your platform among small and medium-sized businesses? [SEP] million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other platform, but with us it's cheap, it's very easy to use and that gives us a way to continue to work with SMBs and increasingly grow our business with them. [SEP] We see a huge opportunity here to educate and help SMBs understand the benefits of video, and we are confident that this will drive further growth in our user base and revenue.","3727":"We understand that the current economic environment is challenging for many industries, including ours. [SEP] And so we're taking a long-term approach and doing what we normally do, which is really focus on continuing to drive greater and greater efficiency. [SEP] We are confident that our efforts to improve efficiency will lead to stronger financial performance in the long run.","3728":"Can you give us an overview of how our products performed in the last quarter? [SEP] We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad, but if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category which the watch did extremely well, and so there are lots of good things happening there. [SEP] However, there have been some concerns about our ability to sustain this growth in the current economic climate. What measures are we taking to address these challenges and continue our success?","3729":"Now let's talk about our commercial cloud gross margins. [SEP] If you think about the portion of our commercial cloud gross margins that come from depreciation, it's best to think of it as roughly half. [SEP] The other half of the gross margins comes from services and other revenue streams.","3730":"As we look ahead to our next quarter, we are continuing our focus on innovation and finding new ways to engage with our customers. [SEP] So, one example of some of the things that we're excited about, again, are the click-to-Messenger ads.

[SEP] If you compare to the iPhone 5s, what we're seeing is the upgrade rate today is slightly higher or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a similar time period in terms of rate than the iPhone 5s. [SEP] This is a promising trend that we hope to maintain with future product releases.","3735":"We have made significant investments in our logistics network over the past year,\" said the company CEO during the earnings conference call. \"In particular, we have opened 26 new warehouses across the country. [SEP] Most of those 26 warehouses we talked about. [SEP] These new facilities have allowed us to decrease delivery times and improve overall customer satisfaction,\" continued the CEO. \"Additionally, they have increased our overall capacity, enabling us to better meet the growing demand for our products.","3736":"Thank you for joining us on today's earnings conference call. [SEP] And so we think that does help us in that environment, but clearly, macroeconomics stands out there as a risk on top of other issues that we face, leading to a deceleration of revenue growth in 2019. [SEP] However, we are confident in our strategy and believe we are well positioned to navigate these challenges and drive long-term growth.","3737":"We saw a significant increase in revenue from this time last year due to the pandemic-related surge in demand. [SEP] So, yes, that will be a factor that we're comping for the next 12 months. [SEP] However, we believe that our strong brand reputation and loyal customer base will help us continue to grow even as we face these challenging comparables.","3738":"We've seen tremendous growth in our user engagement over the past quarter.

[SEP] Our recent growth and expansion into new markets is a testament to our ability to adapt and thrive.","3742":"We're now going to open the call up for questions from our analysts and investors.

I'd like to take a moment to address that. [SEP] We discussed how we don't price devices to make money. [SEP] Instead, our focus is on building a relationship with our customers and expanding our ecosystem. When customers are happy with our devices, they are more likely to purchase other products and services from us in the future. This is why we prioritize affordability and accessibility over maximizing profits on device sales.","3749":"The question is about the different levels of privacy that users can have on our platform. [SEP] And also there's a range from private one-on-one type sharing to small groups, all of your friends at once, large interface communities, and then ultimately fully public. [SEP] We believe that offering this range of options allows our users to tailor their experience to their own needs and preferences.","3750":"We're now opening up the call for questions. We've covered a lot of ground so far. [SEP] So we've been rolling out a number of changes, both product changes and ranking the News Feed.

[SEP] Our team has been working hard to streamline operations and cut unnecessary costs to position us for sustained growth in the long term.","3755":"Our automotive segment has continued to drive our growth in the past quarter. [SEP] So we've seen a lot of good partnerships and arrangements with companies like BMW and Mini and not just in the U.S., but in places like Europe as well. [SEP] These partnerships have allowed us to expand our market reach and access new customers.","3756":"One of the challenges we faced in the second quarter was a decrease in sales compared to the previous quarter. [SEP] The other element that is there and it\u2019s very seasonal, it\u2019s always there, it\u2019s the loss of leverage that we got from Q1 to Q2. [SEP] However, we expect to regain that leverage in the upcoming months as we implement new cost-saving measures.","3757":"We have received a lot of positive feedback from our marketers about our latest campaigns and strategies. [SEP] So I think in terms of the ROI we are able to offer our marketers, the signs are strong, and we also continue to see there's a lot of room for improvement. [SEP] As we move forward, we are focused on leveraging new technology and data analytics to further optimize our ROI and drive even better results for our clients.","3758":"Moving on to our revenue breakdowns, let's focus on the 'other' category. [SEP] So other revenue, which is principally advertising grew 45% this quarter, up from 37% last quarter and the biggest thing in there is advertising and advertising grew at a rate higher than that 45%. [SEP] This growth is attributed to our increased investment in targeted digital marketing campaigns and partnerships with high-profile brands.","3759":"Looking at our financials for the quarter, I'm pleased to report that we saw growth in both revenue and gross margin. As we shift more towards cloud services, we've been able to see these improvements. [SEP] I think we can continue to improve gross margin percentages in the cloud across all the core cloud services.

[SEP] We've seen a growth of native ads. [SEP] We believe that this growth trend in native ads will continue in the upcoming quarters.","3765":"We've seen unprecedented growth in our e-commerce business over the past year, driven in part by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift in consumer behavior. Our partnership with Amazon has been a key part of this growth, as we've expanded our reach and improved our fulfillment capabilities. [SEP] So, to give that some perspective, the Amazon-fulfilled network, or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're continuing to invest heavily in our e-commerce operations, with a focus on expanding our fulfillment network and improving delivery times.

[SEP] But overall, our international segment showed strong growth and we expect that trend to continue.","3844":"Our earnings report demonstrates impressive growth in the Asian market, particularly in China. [SEP] Also, if I zoom out and look at China, as I have said before and just to make the point once again is we see an enormous change in China over the next several years. [SEP] This change is largely due to the growing middle class and their increased purchasing power, which presents significant growth opportunities for our company.","3845":"We've received a lot of questions from our shareholders about how we plan to allocate our cash flow. [SEP] And in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we've provided a amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually.

[SEP] We think they are very customer-centric, just like us. [SEP] That being said, we believe our unique approach to customer satisfaction sets us apart in the market.","3847":"Let me now turn to our revenue breakdown by channel. [SEP] So we're very - excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them. [SEP] We continue to see strong growth in our online ordering component, which is primarily driven by the convenience of Prime Now delivery. We expect this trend to continue as more and more customers adopt online ordering as their preferred method of grocery shopping.","3848":"We have received feedback from investors that they would like more transparency and updates on our progress. [SEP] Right now, we're doing it, I think it's every six months, but the goal is to get that to the cadence by, I think it's the end of this year, we're going to be doing it quarterly and doing calls to discuss the results just like we do for earnings [SEP] We believe that increasing the frequency of these updates will improve communication and trust with our stakeholders.

We are excited to see the positive impact this increased transparency and communication will have on our company's performance.","3849":"We are excited to announce that we have recently implemented a new feature to our online ordering platform.

[SEP] That's just due to product marketing and that's just not going to necessarily be a steady quarter-to-quarter trend. [SEP] However, we anticipate some fluctuations in sales over the next few quarters as we focus on expanding into new markets and increasing our brand visibility.","3854":"Our sales and revenue numbers for this quarter have been impressive. [SEP] It's that E3 transition as well as installed base growth. [SEP] We expect strong performance in the upcoming quarter due to our new product launches and strategic partnerships.","3855":"We had a very successful quarter with record-breaking earnings. [SEP] There's going to be quarters where the opposite is going to happen. [SEP] However, we anticipate some market volatility in the upcoming quarter that may impact our profitability.","3856":"Our revenue growth has been slowing down in the past quarters. [SEP] So we felt like that was not sustainable. [SEP] As a result, we have implemented cost-cutting measures to maintain our profitability.","3857":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our Prime Now service, which continues to be a growth driver for our business. [SEP] We're also adding restaurant, Amazon Restaurant Delivery to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. and that's up from two last year.

We're seeing strong momentum across our portfolio of products and platforms, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. [SEP] I think that will continue and continue to drive impression growth and then we hope to continue to make progress on Facebook where we\u2019re seeing growth, but it\u2019s off a smaller base. [SEP] We're also making strategic investments in areas like video, e-commerce, and messaging, which we believe will drive engagement and revenue growth over the long-term. Overall, we're confident in our ability to deliver meaningful value to our users, customers, and shareholders.","3859":"We are thrilled to announce that our partnership with Amazon is bearing fruit.

[SEP] Do you anticipate these trial members converting to long-term customers?","3863":"We have seen a strong demand for our offerings in the technology sector and continue to explore opportunities for growth. [SEP] And you can see from our past several years that we have an intense interest in the space and are adding products and services, non-monetized services, so far to that. [SEP] We believe that by expanding our non-monetized services, we can deepen our relationship with our customers and drive even more demand for our products in the long-term.","3864":"Let me elaborate on our iPhone sales performance for the last quarter. [SEP] To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter, and that's very important because we're attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported. [SEP] This illustrates the importance of looking beyond just the reported numbers and taking a closer look at product demand and customer preferences.","3865":"As we continue to expand our customer base, we are shifting our focus towards enhancing our relationships with existing clients. [SEP] We're really in the \u2013 in that phase two where we're really talking about building those organic interactions.

While we have made progress in certain areas, such as increasing our customer base, we still face challenges in others. We know we need to do better, and we are committed to taking the necessary steps to achieve our goals. [SEP] And as I mentioned, I think we believe we still have a lot of work to do to continue to improve that. [SEP] One area where we see significant potential for improvement is in our marketing strategy.

We will continue to iterate and improve our ad delivery platform to ensure our advertisers can achieve the best results possible.","3887":"Our team has been closely monitoring our user data over the past quarter.

[SEP] We believe that these investments are crucial to remain competitive in the market and maintain our reputation for excellence.","3894":"We've seen significant growth in our video content over the past year, and we want to continue to build on that momentum.

[SEP] So we think all of these things work together. [SEP] Overall, we're optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in the coming quarters.","3897":"We've been seeing some fluctuations in our product mix lately, particularly in terms of premium services.

[SEP] Our focus for the next quarter is to continue to innovate and provide even better services to our customers.","3927":"Our quarterly earnings report shows a mixed bag of results. Revenue from cloud services has surpassed our expectations, but we have noticed a decline in commercial licensing. During this conference call, we would like to address this issue and discuss our strategies to maintain profitability. [SEP] And so while we have a comparability issue that will show itself most directly as weakness in commercial licensing and most specifically as weakness in Office transactional licensing which will be a headwind, the overall goal of continuing to have more customers every quarter move to the cloud or whether or not they move, adding cloud services even if they have on prem ises licenses, is going to continue to be a very good business for us. [SEP] Our team is committed to driving innovation and developing new cloud-based solutions that will meet the evolving needs of our customers. While we acknowledge the challenges posed by the current market conditions, we remain confident about our long-term growth prospects. As we navigate through these uncertain times, our priority is to stay nimble and agile and to position ourselves for continued success in the future.","3928":"We've had a lot of questions about how Azure compares to other cloud services in the market. [SEP] So Azure's stack is completely unique to Microsoft. [SEP] And we believe that this uniqueness is driving the strong growth we're seeing in our cloud business.","3929":"Our Q3 results show significant growth in revenue and net income despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. We're pleased with the progress we're making in expanding our product line and customer base. [SEP] We've managed to do that by continuing to pivot to what I believe are these very high ROI opportunities, and pivoting away from opportunities where we've had a chance to become more efficient, and the rate of returns are not going to be as high, or the structural growth isn't there. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're confident that our focus on high ROI opportunities will continue to drive growth and profitability. We remain committed to innovation and technology leadership in our industry, and we're excited about the prospects for long-term success. Thank you for your support and interest in our company.","3930":"Our team has been focused on growing our cloud-based products, and we have seen strong performance in the last quarter.

[SEP] We do believe that, although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends month to date. [SEP] Additionally, we will continue to monitor and analyze customer behavior to determine the impact of faster shipping on our sales trends.","3935":"During the quarter, we saw an increase in the adoption of our cloud services. We believe this is due in part to our focus on integrating our various offerings across platforms. [SEP] So for example, when you log into Windows, you are logging in with Microsoft account or Azure ID. [SEP] This integration allows for a seamless experience for our users, as they are able to access their data and applications on any device. We are also seeing increased use of our identity services, such as Azure Active Directory, which allows for secure and simplified access to online resources.","3936":"Can you speak to the advantages of your public cloud offering over other providers?\" \n\nStatement: \"And so we have a very good process and that\u2019s a place were quite frankly a lot of the proprietary advantage of someone who is an at scale public cloud provider, not just with one application. [SEP] And so we have a very good process and that\u2019s a place were quite frankly a lot of the proprietary advantage of someone who is an at scale public cloud provider, not just with one application. [SEP] We believe this process gives us a competitive edge in the market and allows us to continue to grow our customer base and revenue.","3937":"Our company has been focused on digital transformation and embracing new technology trends. [SEP] One of the things that we realize is as every company out there becomes a software company, beyond even our traditional reach through IT, everyone has a digital office inside the company. [SEP] To address this new reality, we are exploring opportunities to expand our software offerings and provide solutions that cater to different industries and business functions.","3938":"We\u2019ve been investing a lot in our digital advertising strategy, and while we\u2019ve seen some great successes, there have also been some learning curves. [SEP] I think one of the challenges we\u2019ve had is training the market that you can\u2019t just take your TV ads and put them on video \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, put them on mobile or put them into Facebook [SEP] We\u2019re continuing to work closely with our marketing team to ensure that we\u2019re creating mobile and Facebook-specific content that adds value to our customers and fits seamlessly into their browsing experience.","3939":"We have been exploring new ways to streamline our operations and increase efficiency. [SEP] There is new type of business process automation with operations. [SEP] This new type of business process automation has the potential to greatly improve our workflow and reduce manual errors.","3940":"Can you speak more about your strategy for content on Facebook? [SEP] So when it comes to \u2013 there are lots of businesses on Facebook, there are professional content producers, our main interest here is the people in the community who are using News Feed, not those guys, right? [SEP] We want to prioritize the user experience and ensure that they are seeing content from their friends and family, as well as relevant news and information from credible sources.","3941":"Our cloud business has been growing steadily over the past year. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our cloud offerings and provide better services to our customers. [SEP] So we have an approach which takes all of our cloud pieces together. [SEP] By taking all of our cloud pieces together, we can provide a more seamless experience for our customers across all of our cloud platforms.

Heather, please go ahead. [SEP] We definitely are seeing production workloads that are moving over from on premise, but I think the more interesting thing Heather for us is to see new workloads. [SEP] And that's where we really see the potential for growth, as more and more companies embrace cloud technology for innovative applications and services. Our focus is on providing the best possible solutions to address these new workloads and help our customers stay ahead of the game.","3944":"Now, moving on to our discussion regarding our competitors in the market. [SEP] But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members. [SEP] We're confident that by continuing to focus on providing excellent customer service, we'll remain competitive in the long term.","3945":"We have seen a significant growth in our international segment over the past quarter, particularly from our Asian markets.

[SEP] We continue to be really pleased with the program and like what it does in the warehouse, both from a density of storage, as well as from making the jobs easier for the associates who are picking packages, by bringing the packages actually to the associates. [SEP] Additionally, we've seen a significant reduction in the time it takes to fulfill orders, which has resulted in an increase in both customer satisfaction and repeat business.","3947":"We've seen a lot of interest from advertisers wanting to compare the effectiveness of their TV ads and Facebook ads. They want to know if they are getting the same return on investment (ROI) from both channels. [SEP] So that's where TRP buying comes in, allowing people who usually buy TV ads to plan, buy and measure Facebook ads the same way, enables apples-to-apples comparison that we believe is very strong for our ROI. [SEP] We believe that TRP buying will be a game-changer for our advertising partners. It will provide them with a seamless way to manage both TV and Facebook ads, and give them a more complete understanding of their ad performance. We're excited to see how our advertisers will use this new feature to drive results.","3948":"During the past quarter, our team has been diligently working on implementing processes and protocols to ensure a safer and more secure experience for our users.

[SEP] Additionally, we are seeing strong demand for flexible office space solutions within this segment, and we are continuing to invest in this area to meet the needs of our customers.","3951":"We had a challenging year due to the impact of the pandemic on our business operations. We experienced supply chain disruptions, reduced consumer demand, and changes in consumer behavior. [SEP] Those are headwinds that we had this year and were not there a year ago. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we were still able to generate strong earnings and maintain market share. We are confident that with the rollout of vaccines and continued adaptations to the business environment, we will be able to build on our success.","3952":"Investor: Can you speak to the recent removal of some of your popular apps in certain countries? \n\nCompany representative: Yes, we have had to remove some of our apps in certain countries due to regulatory and legal issues.

And can you comment on how this has impacted your financial performance in those regions? \n\nCompany representative: It's too early to tell at this point, but we are closely monitoring the situation and will provide updates as necessary in our future earnings reports.","3953":"Our team has been closely monitoring the impact of our recent content strategy. We've analyzed engagement rates and shares across multiple platforms. [SEP] And in each one, we talk about the prevalence of the content that people see because we think what matters is the number of impressions or people who are seeing the content, not just \u2013 not if a lot of people are sharing something but no one sees it \u2013 but what is actually getting seen. [SEP] Through our analysis, we've discovered that certain types of content perform better than others in terms of achieving high impression rates.

Our goal is to continue to grow our reach and build a stronger connection with our followers.","3954":"We have seen a significant increase in user engagement on our platform.

[SEP] So there's not differential pricing by product, it's just what are you willing to bid for the format that you want to show to the people that you want to show it to and that's how the system works. [SEP] Are there any limitations or restrictions on who can bid or what products can be advertised?\"\n\nAnswer: \"Sure, our pricing model is based on a bidding system where advertisers bid for ad space for the format they want to show to their target audience. There's no differential pricing by product; it's just how much are you willing to bid for the ad format that you want to show to the people that you want to show it to. Our system is designed to be fair and transparent, so all advertisers have an equal opportunity to place ads based on their budget and desired audience. We do have certain guidelines for acceptable ads and prohibited content, but otherwise, anyone with an advertising account can bid on available space in our system.","3960":"We have been making significant investments in our research and development capabilities to enhance the value we bring to our customers. [SEP] And so I think as long as we focus on providing that value, we'll feel good about our opportunity to both grow and take share in the market. [SEP] In addition, we are also exploring strategic partnerships and collaborations that will allow us to expand our reach in untapped markets.","3961":"Our latest earnings report shows that we had a strong quarter with revenue growth of 42% year-over-year. [SEP] because as Mark said, we care not just about time spent on Facebook, but time well spent. [SEP] In order to continue to prioritize time well spent, we are investing in new technologies and features that will enhance the user experience and promote meaningful interactions on our platform.","3962":"Our quarterly earnings report has been impressive and we are pleased to share details about our performance today. Our team has been working diligently to drive growth in various market segments.

We expect these initiatives to continue to drive growth in the coming quarters and position us for long-term success. Thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to your questions.","3963":"During the last quarter, we had an aggressive strategy to launch our new product in the market. [SEP] We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. [SEP] However, due to unexpected delays in production, we had to postpone the launch until the next quarter.","3964":"We have seen significant growth in our Stories feature over the past quarter. [SEP] Now right now, one of the interesting things about Stories is there's a benefit to being an early adopter. [SEP] As more and more users begin to adopt this feature, we anticipate that the advantage of being an early adopter will diminish.","3965":"We've been working hard on developing new technology that will revolutionize the retail industry.

We have been aggressively expanding our product offerings and marketing efforts to reach new customers. [SEP] And so while we feel great about continuing to add seats at that type of rate, converting and adding net new into our install base, you will see that growth rate come down just because the business is getting quite big. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to sustain a strong growth trajectory in the long-term.

[SEP] However, it's important to note that this category includes more than just Prime Now orders, such as orders made through our website and other online platforms.","3984":"And now let's move on to our plans for the upcoming fiscal year.

[SEP] Of course, we'll be looking to go beyond that floor and find innovative ways to generate revenue from our platform.","3992":"Our focus on community building has led to the growth of our user base. We've seen a surge in daily active users over the past quarter. [SEP] They're not coming necessarily to engage in a specific type of video or specific community around video.

We believe our Services business will continue to be a major driver of growth in the years ahead.","3996":"And when you combine them with our growth projections, the potential is quite exciting.

[SEP] We believe that this product will not only differentiate us from our competitors, but also continue to drive our growth and revenue for years to come.","4003":"One of the key factors driving our revenue growth this quarter was our strong partnerships with advertisers. [SEP] So working with us, they did five video ads, and on our platform, they could not just do the video format but they could target millennials and people who like spicy food, which is very specific targeting. [SEP] As a result of this targeted approach, we saw a significant increase in engagement and click-through rates compared to previous campaigns.","4004":"Now, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO to discuss our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.

[SEP] So that's our primary focus. [SEP] However, we are also exploring potential new opportunities in emerging markets to diversify our revenue streams.","4008":"We've really focused on creating a customer-centric culture here at the company. And part of that means we've had to rethink how we approach payments. [SEP] So we view the payment in that context not as the goal, but as something that's helping the business and the person succeed at having the transaction or doing what they're trying to do. [SEP] Ultimately, we believe that if we can help our customers complete their transactions quickly and seamlessly, that will lead to greater loyalty and more business down the road. So we see these payments not just as a means of getting paid, but as a way to build stronger relationships with our customers and drive growth for the company.","4009":"We have decided to adjust our pricing strategy for our database software offering. [SEP] So the decision logic was driven primarily by what I would say is the increased competitiveness of SQL Server.

As you can see on the data sheet in front of you, we've achieved a 21% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year.

[SEP] And then we're seeing some impact from how advertisers are using their own data for targeting. [SEP] However, overall advertising revenue is still strong and we're confident in our ability to adapt to these changes.","4019":"We've seen a lot of growth in our user base in the last year and we anticipate this trend to continue. [SEP] So I kind of expect in a year or 2, the world that we're going to be in is people use Facebook, they're going to use News Feed, and then they're probably each going to have 2 or 3 other of these social utilities that they find valuable. [SEP] We're also exploring potential partnerships and acquisitions to expand our portfolio of social utilities and provide even more value to our users.","4020":"We have seen significant growth in our cloud services division over the past quarter.

[SEP] And we're pleased to report that our efforts have resulted in a record-breaking quarter for App Store revenue.","4025":"In terms of profitability, we have been focusing on increasing our gross margin over the past few quarters.

[SEP] So it's at 97%, still very strong, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter in other revenue as I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by a good margin is the advertising revenue and we are comping a period of rapid growth in the prior year, so that is part of the factor there as you mentioned, but I\u2019d just reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong adoption across Amazon\u2019s vendors, sellers, authors, all types of advertisers that are utilizing that. [SEP] And we remain optimistic about the future growth potential of our advertising business.","4054":"Can you speak to the level of predictability we should expect in terms of revenue growth going forward? [SEP] So as the business gets bigger and we do bigger and larger deals and some of them are on-prem and some of them are in Azure, you're going to see volatility frankly in both of those.

We will continue to invest in our business and work towards delivering long-term value to our shareholders.","4057":"Our Q2 earnings have shown growth in revenue and net income beyond our expectations.

We've learned a lot from our successes and challenges in the past, and we're committed to taking a more strategic approach going forward. [SEP] We definitely need to be smart about two things that Amy said before, which is pick markets that are secular growth markets and got big TAM. [SEP] Of course, it's not enough to just pick the right markets - we also need to execute well in those markets and stay ahead of the competition. But starting with the right foundation in terms of market selection will give us a much better chance of success in the long run. So as we move forward, we'll be looking closely at the markets we're targeting and making sure we're staying true to our strategic goals.","4059":"Looking ahead to our projections for next year, I have great confidence in our ability to maintain and even expand our market share.

Our focus on research and development is ensuring that we stay ahead of the competition and provide our clients with the best possible solutions.","4066":"Now turning to our outlook for the next quarter. [SEP] In terms of the sort of the key catalysts and the changes, the cord cutting in our view is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster rate than is widely thought. [SEP] While this presents challenges, we also see it as an opportunity to innovate and find new ways to deliver content to our customers.","4067":"Moving on to our software and licensing business, I want to provide an update on our annuity volume licensing business. As you know, this has been a key area of focus for us in recent years. [SEP] We actually had our annuity volume licensing business as you know, has been showing growth and stability for a while as we talked about Pro is back to the pre-XP levels and while could see some fluctuation, I think this has been a very stable business for us for a long period of time when you take out that XP bump from last year.

In addition, we are exploring new partnerships and strategic initiatives that we believe will further drive growth in this important area of our business.","4068":"Can you talk a little bit about your strategy for working with brands? [SEP] For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers. [SEP] We've seen success with this approach in the past and we believe it will continue to be a key driver of our growth going forward.","4069":"I'd like to start by discussing our recent financial performance. [SEP] So, first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. [SEP] However, we have also faced some challenges in other areas of our business, such as declining sales in our retail division.","4070":"Our e-commerce business has been growing rapidly year over year, with a significant portion of our revenue coming from online sales.

We think that video is actually going to be one of the primary ways that people communicate in the future. [SEP] And part of the reason why we're investing in it is we see that video as a medium is not only in the future going to be about people producing content that looks like traditional content and then consuming it in a static rectangle video screen. [SEP] We see video as being a really big part of the future, and we want to make sure that our platform is set up to take advantage of that. So we're investing heavily in our video capabilities, both on the production side and on the distribution side.","4072":"We've been analyzing our customer journey in great detail over the past quarter.

[SEP] We believe that this provides a more comprehensive understanding of where our revenue is coming from and how it's trending over time.","4080":"Our advertising revenue has been steadily increasing over the past few years, primarily driven by an increase in ad load.

But I wanted to address a question we've gotten a lot lately about the recent increases in ad prices. [SEP] And then on the 35% increases in ad prices, this is really being driven off of a couple things. [SEP] First, there's just a lot of demand for ad space on our platform. Advertisers are seeing great results from their campaigns, which makes them willing to pay more to reach our users.

[SEP] If you could almost take out that 606 impact in the billings team to almost mirror the Microsoft 365 SKUs we sell. [SEP] This has been a challenge for us as our billings are not aligned with the Microsoft 365 SKUs that we offer, and it has affected our overall revenue recognition.","4152":"We've been closely tracking our progress on Instagram Stories and we've seen some encouraging signs. [SEP] In ads in Stories, we rolled out globally about 1.5 years after launching Instagram so it's still early but we're definitely seeing a lot of value for businesses on Instagram, and we believe same on Facebook.

[SEP] This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team.","4156":"We've been keeping a close eye on our key performance indicators over the past few quarters.

This information has been very useful as we continue to refine our development strategy and prioritize new features.","4157":"Can you talk about any technological advancements or changes you've made in your decision-making processes? [SEP] We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into the decisions. [SEP] This shift towards using software and algorithms has resulted in significant cost-savings for the company and has allowed us to streamline our operations.","4158":"I wanted to touch upon our cloud services revenue for the quarter. [SEP] And I\u2019d say the way we think about it is actually more -- we're talking about Azure per user, it really does move more with M365 per user. [SEP] In fact, we've seen strong growth in Azure adoption as companies continue to transition to remote work models and require cloud-based solutions.","4159":"Our company has seen significant growth in the past quarter. [SEP] We have Amazon fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. [SEP] We attribute this growth to our strong partnership with Amazon and our commitment to providing high-quality products and exceptional customer service.","4160":"We've noticed a significant increase in engagement on our Stories feature over the past few months [SEP] It\u2019s a little bit different than Feed posts, so comparing apples and oranges a bit.

In particular, we saw significant growth in our business in China.\"\n\n\"In spite of the challenges we faced due to the pandemic, our team in China was able to execute on our strategy effectively and drive strong results. [SEP] Our business in China was very strong last quarter. [SEP] We expect continued momentum in China going forward, as we see strong demand for our products and services in the region.\"\n\n\"To support our growth in China, we are investing in additional resources and expanding our presence in key markets.\"\n\n\"Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our business in China and excited about the opportunities ahead.","4162":"We've seen market conditions change quite a bit over the last few quarters.

[SEP] We think it's a similar - we know it's a consistent process and there are times when we under run and sometimes we over run it. [SEP] However, we regularly review our processes to identify areas where we can improve and optimize our performance.","4164":"One analyst asked about the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. [SEP] Yeah, I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win. [SEP] The CEO agreed that cooperation between the two countries was crucial for global economic success, but noted that the current political climate made it difficult to predict future outcomes.","4165":"Our Pro business has been a key driver of growth for us over the past few quarters. We have seen strong demand from both small and large businesses alike. [SEP] I expect our overall Pro business to remain in line with business PCs. [SEP] We will continue to invest in our Pro business to ensure that we are meeting the changing needs of our customers. Additionally, we will be closely monitoring market trends and adjusting our strategy accordingly to maintain our competitive edge.","4166":"Now, turning to our regional performance. [SEP] And then Brazil was particularly weak last Q3. [SEP] However, we have seen some positive growth in Brazil so far this quarter and we are expecting a stronger performance overall in the region for Q4.","4167":"Our company has been investing heavily in research and development for the past several years. [SEP] And so we see that benefit even on that front. [SEP] Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance this quarter, and we believe that we are well positioned for future growth.","4168":"Can you tell us what tools you use to analyze our company's data? [SEP] I use Power BI . [SEP] Great, thank you for sharing that. How has Power BI helped you make more informed business decisions?","4169":"We've seen incredible growth and engagement on our Prime membership program. We continue to invest heavily in new benefits and experiences for our Prime members. [SEP] That includes video content including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now.

We believe these additional benefits will continue to drive membership growth and loyalty.","4170":"Moving on to our performance in the Asia-Pacific region. [SEP] And in constant currency terms, we were actually up 6% in mainland China. [SEP] This was driven by strong demand for our products and successful marketing initiatives targeted towards the Chinese market.","4171":"We have seen significant growth in our customer base over the past few quarters, and are pleased with the momentum we are seeing across the business. Our focus on product innovation and customer success is driving strong results. [SEP] So we are starting to get to that point Mark where you have a big base, which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps in the one that you saw this quarter, and your right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter and this one certainly was as well. [SEP] Looking ahead to 2022, we are confident in our ability to continue to drive growth and achieve our strategic objectives. We remain committed to investing in our products, people, and processes to ensure we are well positioned for long-term success.","4172":"Our revenue growth has been slower than we anticipated this year. We've been working hard to identify areas where we can improve our competitiveness and drive more sales. [SEP] We've had multiple price cuts this year [SEP] Despite the price cuts, we're seeing positive trends in our sales volume. We believe these measures will position us for stronger growth in the future.","4173":"We've recently implemented some changes in our business strategy. [SEP] And this is a different approach than we would\u2019ve taken a few years ago, right? [SEP] But we believe this new approach aligns better with our long-term goals and has already shown promising results.","4174":"Our sales team has been working hard to expand our customer base. [SEP] I feel we've got a very broad base of customers from startups to small-medium businesses to large enterprises to the public sector. [SEP] We've also seen growth in international markets, particularly in Asia and Europe.","4175":"We are pleased to report that our company's financial performance has continued to be strong. Our revenue has increased by X percent compared to the same quarter last year. [SEP] The number of people transacting on our stores continues to grow. [SEP] We attribute this growth to several factors, including our ongoing efforts to improve the user experience on our website and mobile app, as well as our aggressive marketing efforts. While we are pleased with our progress so far, we remain focused on continuing to innovate and staying ahead of the competition.","4176":"We've been receiving a lot of questions about our progress on the new platform we're developing. [SEP] So the first thing that I want to stress here is that these kind of new platforms take a long time to develop [SEP] However, we believe that the investment will be worth it in the end as it will significantly enhance our business capabilities and offerings.","4177":"Thank you for that question. As you know, we launched our new product line last quarter and have seen strong interest in the market. [SEP] But we are still early in the development stage, so it'd be early to be talking about large volume shipments. [SEP] However, we are optimistic about the growth potential and are working diligently to scale up production to meet demand. As we progress, we will keep our shareholders and stakeholders updated on our progress in this area.","4178":"Our quarterly earnings report showed continued growth and success in the market.

Overall, we are incredibly excited about the potential for this program to create value for our shareholders and customers alike.","4181":"Our Q4 earnings were very strong, which was largely due to the excellent execution of our team. We are very pleased with the results we achieved during the quarter, and we're looking forward to building on this success in the coming year. [SEP] Number one, the unearned strength that we saw at the end of Q4, you\u2019re right, was very good execution on renewals on a reasonably large renewal base. [SEP] Looking forward, we believe that the strength we saw at the end of Q4 will continue into the first quarter of this year. We have a number of new initiatives in the pipeline that we believe will drive revenue growth, and we're excited to see these projects come to fruition.

[SEP] We expect the market for cloud services to continue to grow and we believe our innovative solutions and exceptional customer service will keep us at the forefront of this growth. As we continue to make progress in our cloud conversion efforts, we remain confident in the long-term success of our business.","4183":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the usage of our new digital platform. [SEP] But it was coming at the expense of people interacting with each other as much. [SEP] As we move forward, we will continue to find ways to balance the convenience of technology with the importance of human connection and interaction.","4184":"Our latest product release has been generating a lot of buzz in the market. [SEP] We're excited about the number of customers that are trying it and that all the value it offers. [SEP] As a result, we are seeing a significant uptick in our sales pipeline.","4185":"Now let's turn to our analysis of our sales performance in developed markets over the past quarter. [SEP] In developed markets, it is stable and we feel like we're pretty close to saturation in a lot of countries, like the U.S. [SEP] However, we are still exploring potential growth opportunities in emerging markets, where we have seen increasing demand and have been able to establish a strong foothold.","4186":"We are expecting to see significant growth in our international markets this quarter. [SEP] And it's going to depend obviously also on regional mixes too [SEP] However, we are closely monitoring any potential impacts from global trade tensions that could affect our sales in certain regions.","4187":"We have made significant progress in our digital transformation efforts. [SEP] So there are all these transitions. [SEP] However, we anticipate that these transitions may affect our short-term financial performance.","4188":"We've had strong financial performance this quarter, driven by our product innovation and expanded customer base. [SEP] It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that are going through Apple Pay right now and we think ahead for the long term, that could be an interesting business for us as well. [SEP] Additionally, we're continuing to invest in new technologies and partnerships to deepen our presence in emerging markets.","4189":"We're pleased to report another quarter of strong earnings and revenue growth. Our team has been executing well and we've made progress on several key initiatives. [SEP] And we see all of those continuing to be factors for growth going forward.

[SEP] We also launched a new pricing plan which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. and we've expanded, as you know, previously into London. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're planning to further expand our global footprint by entering new markets in Asia and South America.","4191":"I am pleased to report that our gross margin has improved for the third consecutive quarter. [SEP] Those taken together continue to show gross margin improvement. [SEP] This is a clear indication that our cost-cutting measures and focus on operational efficiency are paying off.","4192":"Our first question comes from the line of a financial analyst based in New York. [SEP] And so -- and I feel like we are reasonably well positioned in China, I\u2019m sure we can do better, but I think we are doing fairly well there. [SEP] Thank you for your insights.

[SEP] So they look for people that at a certain date have used specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button. [SEP] This approach has resulted in a 15% increase in online bookings over the past quarter.","4196":"We're now going to open up the call to questions. [SEP] But at the same time, I think we want to be smart about how many of these phones do we want to generate, how many, which price points we want to participate [SEP] We're currently seeing a shift in the market, with customers increasingly looking for more affordable phone options. We want to make sure that we're catering to this demand while also maintaining the high quality that our customers expect from us. That being said, we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us in the smartphone market and look forward to bringing new and innovative products to market in the coming months and years.","4197":"We've been closely monitoring the impact of ad signal changes on our revenue and performance. As we've previously mentioned, this has been a challenge for us. [SEP] So I don't think anything has changed since Q3 in terms of our outlook on the headwinds that we have around ad signals. [SEP] However, we've been working on developing new strategies to mitigate these headwinds. We're confident that with these efforts, we can continue to grow our business and deliver value to our shareholders.","4198":"We've had a strong quarter in terms of revenue growth and customer acquisition. [SEP] I think with all products, I think about the complete sales cycle and I am really encouraged by the fact that we're doing a good job of moving from the initial sales through deployment, through adding on services and back to renewals and I think the importance of that customer lifecycle is really how we think about our workloads and our workload health in the cloud. [SEP] Our team is dedicating resources to improve the customer experience from start to finish, including better communication and support throughout the sales cycle.","4199":"Let's now move on to our ad revenues for the quarter.

This strategy has proven to be successful in driving sales and increasing our market share.","4201":"Our latest earnings report shows that we have seen a slight decrease in profitability due to increased operational costs.

[SEP] We have implemented new technology and processes to reduce energy consumption and increase server utilization rates, leading to cost savings for our company.","4202":"We are very pleased to report a 30% increase in revenue for the quarter. [SEP] The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well. [SEP] We plan to invest a significant portion of this increased revenue into further expanding our product offerings and improving our marketing efforts.","4203":"Now moving on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter.

The first is those that are just starting out, building new products and services, and the second is those that already have a significant investment in on-premise applications and infrastructure. [SEP] If you're starting new, you will have PaaS, which is going to be the first thing you do, but then you'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing, existing data, existing code in a virtual machine. [SEP] That's where our hybrid cloud solutions come in. We make it easy to integrate your on-premise and cloud environments, so you can get the best of both worlds. Our customers are seeing great success with this approach, and we believe it will be a key driver of growth for us going forward.","4206":"We're seeing some really exciting trends in terms of how customers are adopting our technology offerings.

[SEP] That being said, we are still seeing some positive growth and financial results in certain areas of the company.","4211":"We have been considering expanding into the European market for quite some time now. [SEP] But one of the big things that we need to think about here is, of course, we're only going to do this in a way that we're comfortable with over the long term. [SEP] We have a responsibility to our shareholders to make sustainable decisions that will benefit the company in the long run.","4212":"When asked about funding for the new expansion program in the U.S., the CEO responded. [SEP] We will continue to generate cash in the U.S., but definitely a good portion of the program will be funded through debt. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to manage our debt and maintain a strong financial position.","4213":"Our new subscription service has been performing very well in the last quarter. [SEP] Customers certainly like that model. [SEP] We anticipate continued growth for this model as we expand our offerings in the coming months.","4214":"Our user growth continues to be strong, with a 10% increase in monthly active users from the previous quarter. [SEP] because more than 2 billion people are communicating on the service. [SEP] Based on these numbers, we are confident in the long-term growth potential of our platform and plan to invest in new features and enhancements to continue to attract new users.","4215":"One of the things that our company has been monitoring closely is the global economic landscape,\" said the CEO. \"Our products rely heavily on international trade, so we're always keeping a close eye on political and economic relationships between countries. [SEP] And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and I'm actually very optimistic. [SEP] However, there is some uncertainty in the near future with regards to trade agreements and tariffs,\" added the CFO. \"While we remain optimistic, we are also being cautious and taking steps to mitigate any potential risks to our business.","4216":"Now, I'd like to talk a bit about our financial performance this quarter. [SEP] I do believe that the market that which we are operating, the set of assets we've picked, the team we've built, the investments we made in our sales force, even some extent the acquisitions we've done, these are all showing up as top line revenue growth for us. [SEP] As we look ahead to the next quarter, we expect to see further growth and are confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results.","4217":"We've had some really great partnerships over the past year and one of those has been with a company that I really admire. [SEP] So let me also say, after a year of working with them closely, my appreciation and, frankly, a lot of inspiration that I think you've seen in our own product development has been their focus on users and how important it is and how focused they are on it. [SEP] It's really been a pleasure to work with them and I think that we've learned a lot from their approach to user-centered design.","4218":"During the quarter, we saw strong growth in our AWS business. [SEP] And the operational improvements, excuse me, the gross margin, operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have. [SEP] We are confident that our continued focus on operational efficiencies will drive sustained profitability in the future.","4219":"We've seen some changes in the regulatory environment that have prompted us to focus more on privacy. [SEP] And then the third is our own product changes as we put privacy more front and center. [SEP] We're confident that these changes will not only improve the user experience, but also help us maintain long-term trust with our customers.","4220":"Our team has been working hard to innovate and bring new products to the market. [SEP] I look at something like Sway which I\u2019m pretty excited about because basically we\u2019re taking the concept of what is an interactive document and the website and bringing it all together into these Sway documents if you well and if you\u2019re excited about what that could mean in customer service marketing or for school reports. [SEP] We have received positive feedback from our early adopters and are confident in the potential of Sway to become a game-changer in the industry.","4221":"During our last quarter, we focused a lot on improving our user experience and enhancing our product offerings. We've seen a lot of success with this strategy, but we're not done yet.

We believe that by investing in new technologies like AI and the cloud, we can continue to add value for our users and attract new customers. We're excited about the future of our company and we're confident in our ability to deliver innovative solutions that meet the changing needs of our users.","4222":"We have seen a shift in consumer behavior towards online shopping. [SEP] And so that to us is intuitive that they would be. [SEP] Therefore, we have invested heavily in our e-commerce platform to meet this demand.","4223":"Our latest product has been well received by our customers and we have seen an increase in demand. It has been exciting to see the positive impact it has had on our business. [SEP] And of course being used together delivered more value to customers and that\u2019s where our competitive advantage comes. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and improve our products, we believe that our competitive advantage will only grow stronger. We remain committed to delivering the best possible experience to our customers and are confident in our ability to do so.","4224":"We are currently exploring a new business model that would allow us to streamline our operations and reduce costs. This model would involve transitioning from a brick-and-mortar retail presence to an entirely digital platform. [SEP] And structurally, that would of course have higher operating margin. [SEP] This shift would also allow us to reach a wider customer base and offer personalized experiences through data analysis. Overall, we believe this move will ultimately increase shareholder value and position us for long-term growth.","4225":"We're thrilled to see the positive response to our latest product release. [SEP] We think it's being critically acclaimed and also a big hit with customers. [SEP] We're seeing strong demand for it across all our sales channels.","4226":"We've been investing a lot in our messaging products lately, and we've recently made some changes to better align our different messaging services. [SEP] Kind of more like Facebook to the Instagram example that we used before, whereas WhatsApp I think is a much more utilitarian experience with a much more stark UI where there's just not as much emphasis on having a lot of different ways to engage. [SEP] So while WhatsApp remains an incredibly popular app around the world, we think there's still a lot of potential to continue improving the user experience and adding new features to better serve our users.","4227":"Thank you for that question. [SEP] I think its good clarification. [SEP] Does anyone else have any questions?","4228":"Thank you all for joining us on this earnings call. \n2.

With the market trends and customer needs constantly evolving, we are committed to staying nimble and adapting quickly to deliver what our customers want.","4229":"We have exciting news to share about our plans for growth and expansion in the coming months.

[SEP] We believe that this expansion will allow us to reach more customers and grow our market share in the industry.","4230":"We have been heavily investing in our Prime offerings to keep up with the growing demand from our customers. [SEP] But principally, what we're trying to do now is \u2013 again, make the Prime experiences as strong as possible for consumers. [SEP] This means improving delivery times, expanding product categories, and enhancing the overall shopping experience through personalized recommendations.","4231":"We're pleased to report that our Prime membership has grown significantly year-over-year, with millions of new members joining in the last quarter alone. [SEP] We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa.

[SEP] That goes not only for just being able to deliver the content, but being able to understand what it is so we can rank it in News Feed better and show people the right content. [SEP] This has also been a key focus for our AI and machine learning efforts.\n- By improving our ability to understand and rank content, we hope to provide a better experience for our users and improve our advertising offerings.\n- Overall, we're very pleased with the progress we've made in this area, and we believe it will continue to be a key driver of our success going forward.","4235":"Our users have been telling us that they want to see more video content on our platform. [SEP] So we needed to figure out a way so that video can grow, but people can also keep on interacting doing what they tell us that they uniquely want from Facebook. [SEP] After extensive research and testing, we are pleased to announce the launch of our new video feature that allows users to watch and engage with videos while still being able to see their news feed and interact with friends.","4236":"Despite our best efforts to diversify our offerings, we cannot escape the fact that our strongest revenue stream is tied to a market that is now experiencing a slowdown. [SEP] And that's going to have a negative impact on revenue growth.

[SEP] We have seen great success with this strategy and plan to continue to invest in the development and enhancement of Instagram ads in the coming quarters.","4239":"During the last quarter, our impression growth has been quite significant, which is a testament to the strength of our platform.

Our investments in expanding our cloud capabilities and developing strong partnerships have been key factors in this success.","4241":"During the quarter, we launched a new marketing campaign for our warranty program.

Our goal is to enable sellers to access markets all over the world, while also providing customers with a wide range of high-quality products.","4244":"Moving on to segment performance, let's focus on the Productivity and Business Process segment. [SEP] The Productivity and Business Process segment has a bit more transactional exposure just because it has both the consumer and the commercial Office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs, so it's slightly higher all up. [SEP] However, despite this exposure, the segment has seen steady growth in its subscription-based offerings such as Microsoft 365.","4245":"Now, I'd like to provide an update on our cloud services division.

[SEP] So, it's really exciting to see how we are transforming and being a part of these important industries now.","4252":"As we continue to grow our business and expand into new markets, we recognize the importance of strong partnerships and collaboration.

Specifically, we have seen impressive results in Europe and Japan, where we have focused our efforts on streamlining operations and cutting costs. [SEP] I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and also things like marketing working to be very efficient.

[SEP] We believe these new services will differentiate us from our competitors and position us for continued growth in the coming years.","4262":"We've seen a lot of progress in improving our search algorithms to surface more relevant content. [SEP] And then of course, I think that search is often driven by what unique content is in a system and not just the ability to find it. [SEP] That's why we're continuing to invest in creating original and compelling content that our users will love.","4263":"We have recently adopted new accounting standards. [SEP] As part of the adoption, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales.

We believe that having more distribution agreements in place will not only benefit our company, but also increase the convenience for our customers to purchase our products in their preferred retail stores or online platforms.","4277":"Our advertising platform has continued to see growth and success over the past quarter.

So is innovation. That's why we continue to invest heavily in research and development, exploring new ways to enhance our products and services.","4309":"Now let's talk about the impact of currency exchange rates on our business. [SEP] At a macro level, because about two-thirds of our company is outside the United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins; a strong dollar, as it's been during the last four years, has been a bit of a headwind for the company. [SEP] However, we do recognize that currency fluctuations can be unpredictable and we continually monitor the situation to ensure we are well-positioned to navigate any changes.","4310":"Now, let's talk about our product portfolio and the impact it is having on our customer base.

[SEP] Our R&D team has been working hard to develop new products and services that will meet the changing needs of our customers and provide them with real value.","4319":"Our product mix has been a key driver of our growth over the past few quarters. As we continue to expand into new markets and introduce new products, we anticipate that we'll see some fluctuations in that mix. [SEP] But the mix will also shift each quarter, just because the mix is not a stable mix. [SEP] That being said, we're confident in our ability to adapt and react to those changes. We've invested heavily in data analytics to help us better understand customer preferences and trends, and we're constantly tweaking our product lineup to stay ahead of the curve.","4320":"We have seen strong revenue growth in our advertising business over the past quarter. [SEP] Feed from a growth perspective on an impression front is more constrained given where we are with ad loads on Facebook and Instagram. [SEP] However, we are still focused on expanding our user base and increasing engagement to drive future growth.","4321":"Our focus this quarter has been on improving the overall customer experience.

[SEP] And there will be changes in seasonality from quarter to quarter, but structurally those two things, the diversity of what we are doing and how capital is utilized across all of it is I think a big structural differentiator for us. [SEP] How will you continue to prioritize and allocate capital across these diverse business areas in the coming year?","4328":"Our team has worked incredibly hard this quarter to drive sales and increase efficiency. [SEP] So we obviously feel good about a 20% growth. [SEP] However, we recognize that there are still challenges ahead and we remain focused on continuing to innovate and adapt to changes in the market.","4329":"Our team has been working tirelessly to integrate advanced AI technologies into our software.

Let's start with infrastructure. As you all know, it's a critical component of our business and we are constantly investing in it to drive our growth. [SEP] We had a -- we've come off a period where if you remember last year we had less investment needed in infrastructure both for AWS and for Amazon in total.

We believe it's important to stay ahead of the curve and invest aggressively in infrastructure to support our long-term growth and customer needs.","4331":"We are pleased to announce our sales results for the last quarter.

This has not only expanded our reach and customer base, but it has also allowed us to consolidate operations and achieve cost savings that are already starting to have a positive impact on our bottom line. We are confident that this acquisition will ultimately prove to be a wise investment that will generate significant value for our shareholders over time.","4338":"One area of growth that we are particularly excited about is our Watch feature. [SEP] But as Watch has grown, it has proven to us that that these sub-experiences as part of our different apps, similar with IGTV, can be quite successful. [SEP] We plan to continue investing in these sub-experiences to provide even more value to our users and drive revenue growth. We believe that this approach has the potential to be a significant driver of our future success.","4339":"In terms of expenses, we have managed to keep costs under control and have continued to invest in areas that we believe will drive long-term growth. Our operating expenses (OpEx) for the December quarter were slightly higher than the previous year, primarily due to increased investment in R&D and marketing. [SEP] And from what you\u2019ve seen from our guidance for the March quarter, we\u2019re guiding to a growth in OpEx on a year-over-year basis that is similar to what we\u2019ve experienced during the course of the December quarter.

[SEP] But as we continue to invest in these services and build out our offerings, we anticipate seeing a positive impact on overall revenue in the long term.","4347":"We've been exploring different avenues for expansion and growth, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. However, we recognize the importance of being strategic in our approach. [SEP] So I won't shy away from it because what's important to us is growth in areas where we have something unique to contribute and long-term profitability. [SEP] We've identified several key areas where we feel we can make a real difference, and we're investing heavily in those areas. At the same time, we're also being mindful of our long-term profitability goals and making sure that we're not sacrificing that for short-term gains.","4348":"Now moving on to our pricing strategy for the quarter. [SEP] So, so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. [SEP] We believe this will not only attract new customers but also retain our existing ones while increasing our overall market share.","4349":"As we dive into the data from the last quarter, we can see some really promising trends.

These efforts will further solidify our position as a leader in the industry and create new opportunities for revenue and profit growth. Overall, we're optimistic about the direction of the company and look forward to delivering continued value to our shareholders.","4353":"We are pleased to report that our revenue has increased by 10% year-over-year. [SEP] Marketplace is growing nicely. [SEP] In fact, our marketplace has seen a 15% increase in user activity over the same time period, indicating strong engagement with our platform.","4354":"Now I want to talk about our recent initiatives in live video. As you know, video has become a more important part of our platform over the past few years, and we're committed to investing in it as a way to engage our user base.

[SEP] Additionally, we're excited to announce a new partnership that will help us expand our reach and capture even more market share.","4357":"We have noted a significant increase in user engagement on our platform. One of the primary reasons for this is the introduction of native ads. [SEP] They are native format, so they decrease that initial drop-off you see when people click off to another site. [SEP] By using native ads, we have been able to improve the overall user experience on our platform. This has resulted in a longer duration of time spent on our website by our users, which has contributed to increased revenue for the company.","4358":"Moving on to our cloud division, Amazon Web Services or AWS, I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong performance.

[SEP] So as I've said a number of times before, our mission is to connect everyone in the world, and it's hard to do that over the long term if we don't find a way to serve more than a billion people who live in China [SEP] Our team is currently working on strategies to enter the Chinese market, and we are optimistic about the potential for growth in this region.","4399":"During this quarter, we saw a significant increase in iPhone sales in emerging markets. [SEP] We are very focused on growing iPhone around the world, not just in one geography and getting our message out there through ads is one way to do that. [SEP] In addition to advertising, we are also increasing our presence in retail stores and partnering with local carriers to expand our reach in these regions.","4400":"We have been working hard to improve the user experience on our platform, and one area that we have been focusing on is our content distribution algorithm. Our goal is to create a more personalized and relevant content feed for all of our users. [SEP] So all of these millions and millions of pieces content that are out there, whether or not you've added someone as a friend or have liked a page, we'll be able to know a lot better what types of things are going to be interesting to you to produce a much better feed of content. [SEP] This will allow us to showcase more relevant content that is likely to keep users engaged and spend more time on our platform. We believe that this will lead to a better overall user experience and ultimately drive more engagement and ad revenue for our business. We are excited about the progress we have made so far and look forward to continuing to make improvements in this area.","4401":"We've been testing our new software with a select group of customers and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. [SEP] So we're also hoping to roll that out pretty soon widely. [SEP] We believe this new software will greatly improve our customer's experience and drive growth for our business.","4402":"During the quarter, we saw strong growth in our core markets. [SEP] I mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds. [SEP] However, we were impacted by several challenges that affected our overall performance.","4403":"As we continue to explore new opportunities in the market, we want to ensure that our resources are being allocated efficiently. [SEP] So we are not afraid to bring in new capability, but then also questioning what is the allocation we have. [SEP] We believe that there may be potential for expansion into international markets, but we need to carefully assess our current resources and determine if additional capability is necessary.","4404":"We've been seeing a lot of interest in our one-day shipping options lately. [SEP] It's not like you have to search one-day shipping specifically to find out what's available. [SEP] Our search algorithm is really intuitive and will show you all of the available shipping options right on the product page.","4405":"One area of growth we're excited about is our video marketing strategy. [SEP] And so the fact that there's so much consumer video, that gives us the opportunity to do more marketing video as well. [SEP] We've already seen a positive response from consumers and expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","4406":"We are thrilled to announce some exciting developments in our global expansion efforts. [SEP] We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now.

[SEP] There's tons of things on our roadmap of adding functionality to it. [SEP] We are constantly listening to customer feedback and identifying areas of improvement in order to stay ahead of the competition.","4408":"Can you comment on the differences you're seeing in user engagement between markets like the US and Europe versus emerging markets like Southeast Asia or Africa? [SEP] I guess not for the Facebook-only stats, but I think you just get different dynamics based on the, really, characteristics of those countries. [SEP] And how are you adjusting your strategies in these regions to optimize user growth and revenue opportunities?","4409":"I'd like to talk a little bit about our brick-and-mortar retail strategy. [SEP] As you may know, we have three physical bookstores, one Seattle, one in San Diego and one in Portland and two more coming, one in Boston and one in Chicago. [SEP] These stores have become a valuable asset to our brand, showcasing our products and providing a unique in-person shopping experience for our customers.","4410":"We're continuing to invest heavily in our cloud infrastructure to support the increasing demand for data processing and storage. Our goal is to provide our customers with a seamless and scalable experience that can handle their growing data needs. [SEP] And as you need to reason over larger amounts of data, you need not only storage and compute to be co-located all over as the world get them embedded with computing, that\u2019s what we are building for. [SEP] Our approach is to integrate hardware and software to optimize performance and efficiency. We've already seen success with this strategy, as our cloud platform has seen significant growth in usage and revenue. We remain committed to delivering innovative solutions that exceed our customers' expectations.","4411":"With the rise of streaming services, we have seen a notable shift in consumer behavior towards on-demand video content.

[SEP] As a result, we are constantly investing in our video library to ensure we can deliver the most comprehensive selection to our users.","4412":"As we look at our portfolio of investments, we're confident that Sizmek has the potential for significant growth and profitability.

[SEP] In the short-term, however, we may need to make some difficult decisions to navigate through current market challenges and ensure the company's viability.","4413":"We remain focused on innovation and delivering new services and features to our customers. In the past quarter, we added 932 services and features to our platform. [SEP] That's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features. [SEP] This trend is expected to continue as we invest heavily in research and development. Our goal is to provide the most comprehensive and cutting-edge solutions for our customers, and we are proud of the progress we have made thus far.","4414":"We've had a lot of interest in our cloud offerings lately, and we're really pleased with the results we've seen so far. We knew that investing in our cloud infrastructure would pay off, and we're starting to see that happening now. [SEP] So we're seeing the breadth and depth of our cloud offering, which is what we are really architected to have real synergies in the context of what our customers want to achieve, and that's what we are seeing. [SEP] Our cloud team has been working hard to add new features and capabilities to our platform, and we're already seeing the benefits of their efforts. We're confident that our cloud offering will continue to be a key driver of growth for the company in the coming years.","4415":"We are seeing some short-term challenges in the market due to the pandemic, but we remain confident in our ability to weather this storm. Our team has been proactive in adjusting to the changing landscape and we are continuing to invest in our core business. [SEP] And the long term I think is very, very strong there.

We are confident in the potential of this platform and will continue to invest in and grow our grocery business to better meet customer demand.","4418":"We've seen some strong performance in our advertising business over the past few quarters. [SEP] And that's going to be particularly pronounced as we get into the second half of 2017 because ad load will be a less significant factor driving growth starting in the second half. [SEP] Instead, we're going to focus on improving the quality of our ads and increasing our user engagement metrics.","4419":"Now I want to shift the discussion to our marketing strategy and growth potential. As you all know, our platform is built to help businesses of all sizes reach their target audience and achieve their advertising goals. [SEP] When you think about our marketer growth, I think we have an ability to grow both the number of advertisers who use our platform, but also the percentage of their business that we get. [SEP] We have been investing heavily in our sales and marketing teams to drive advertiser acquisition and retention. Additionally, we are constantly improving our technology and targeting capabilities to offer a seamless advertising experience for our customers. With all these efforts, we are confident in our ability to continue growing our market share and driving long-term value for both advertisers and shareholders.","4420":"So, as we continue to build our platform, we're really focused on breaking down these barriers and enabling people to share and express themselves freely. [SEP] And the idea is that there are all these different barriers that any given person has to being able to share and express everything that they want, from technical barriers, it's really hard to communicate with someone if you're not on the internet and they're far away, to product barriers, it's hard to share videos if we don't have a good product for sharing videos, to legal barriers, it's hard to share content that your government says is illegal for you to share. [SEP] We believe that the more we can create a truly open and accessible platform, the more we can empower people around the world to connect with each other and to share their stories and experiences.","4421":"Our revenue has exceeded expectations this quarter. [SEP] We're very encouraged. [SEP] We believe we have a solid strategy for continued growth in the coming year.","4422":"Moving onto our brick and mortar presence, I'd like to provide an update on our physical stores revenue for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. As you know, our physical stores have been impacted by the ongoing pandemic and the shift towards online shopping. [SEP] In our physical stores, it feels there are supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. [SEP] However, we are pleased to report that despite these challenges, our physical stores revenue exceeded our expectations. We saw strong sales at our Whole Foods locations, as well as increased foot traffic at some of our other stores due to the easing of lockdown restrictions. We remain committed to the growth and improvement of our physical retail presence as we continue to adapt to the ever-changing retail landscape.","4423":"We've received a lot of positive responses from our customers about the new product line. [SEP] And so it\u2019s great to get that kind of feedback. [SEP] This only reinforces our commitment to delivering high-quality products that meet the needs of our customers.","4424":"We've seen incredible growth in our Alexa devices sales this quarter, with Echo Dot being the best-selling product. [SEP] And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa into their products, which then creates a great network effect. [SEP] We're excited to see the continued adoption of Alexa Voice Service among developers, and we believe this will drive even more innovation and growth for our Alexa ecosystem.","4425":"Our team has been closely monitoring the shift in consumer behavior towards passive consumption. With the rise of online streaming services and social media, we've observed a decline in active engagement and interaction between users. [SEP] And I do think that that is likely going to continue this trend of decreasing passive consumption, but if we do our jobs well, it should increase the number of meaningful interactions that people have. [SEP] Our goal is to create content that not only informs and entertains, but also fosters genuine connection between individuals. We believe that by prioritizing quality over quantity, we can inspire our audience to engage in more meaningful conversations and build stronger communities.","4426":"Now I'd like to discuss our inventory levels and in-stock position since the acquisition. [SEP] We've made no changes post acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in stock, except perhaps the fact that the price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. [SEP] Overall, we remain optimistic about our ability to maintain strong in-stock levels in the coming quarters, despite the challenges presented by supply chain disruptions and ongoing demand fluctuations.","4427":"We're excited to announce that we've recently expanded our production facilities. [SEP] This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers, and we think it makes sense over the long-term. [SEP] Additionally, with this extra capacity, we're able to entertain larger orders from potential customers, allowing for potential growth in revenue.","4428":"During the Q&A portion of the call, an analyst asked about the company's stance on mergers and acquisitions. [SEP] When it comes to our appetite for M&A, actually it has remained unchanged, which is when things meet our criteria and when we feel like it's in core areas for us, where markets are expanding, where the companies have a unique asset, I think that our ability to both execute on those and see them both execute on their own and execute inside Microsoft, I actually feel quite good that we don't worry about our ability to do them, but I wouldn't say that's new this quarter. [SEP] Overall, we believe that M&A can be a key driver of growth for our company and we remain open to exploring potential opportunities.","4429":"We've seen strong growth in our Prime membership base and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. [SEP] And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for us [SEP] Another area of focus is improving the customer experience, which includes fast and reliable delivery times. We believe our investments in Fulfillment by Amazon will help us achieve this goal.","4430":"Now moving on to our cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services or AWS. [SEP] On AWS revenue, let me just remind you that quarterly growth last year on an FX-neutral basis, so Q1 was 48%, then 49%, then 46% and 46%. [SEP] We are thrilled to report that the momentum has continued this year with FX-neutral growth rates of 54%, 49%, and 47% for Q1, Q2, and Q3 respectively. Our team has been working hard to add new services, features, and regions to AWS to better serve our customers and we believe that our continued investment in this area is paying off. Overall, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of AWS and we are committed to investing in the necessary resources to maintain our leadership position in the market.","4431":"Our latest product release has been received positively in the market and has garnered immense interest among our customers. We have been constantly listening to our customers' feedback and working on incorporating their suggestions in our products to make them more efficient and user-friendly. [SEP] I mean that service with full compatibility with SQL Server is a fantastic value proposition for our customers who have huge estates whether it's the Data Warehouse that's become very, very competitive, the Data Lake. [SEP] Additionally, our team has been working on enhancing our customer support by implementing new tools and processes to provide proactive assistance. We believe that our continued focus on innovation and customer-centricity will enable us to maintain our leadership position in the market.","4432":"During this quarter's earnings call, we will be discussing our recent product launches and updates.

The new operating system is set to release later this year and we are excited to see the positive impact it will have on our users' experiences.","4433":"I'd like to take a moment to recognize the strong leadership we have at the executive level. [SEP] The clarity of focus and clarity of the vision that Kevin and Mike have has been exceptional. [SEP] Their strategic planning has been instrumental in our company's recent success and I have no doubt it will continue to propel us forward.","4434":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to some specific areas of our business. [SEP] So on the first, Atlas is really important [SEP] We've seen great success with their latest product line and anticipate continued growth in this partnership.","4435":"In response to a question on the current state of the company's supply chain. [SEP] And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. [SEP] However, we are actively working to mitigate the impact and are exploring alternative sources for our materials.","4436":"Now turning to our strategy for the next quarter. [SEP] We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward. [SEP] We have several exciting new projects in the pipeline that we believe will continue to drive growth and strengthen our position in the market.","4437":"Our company has been heavily investing in virtual reality technology for the past few years and we are beginning to see some interesting developments. [SEP] For the first few years of virtual reality, I think gaming and video are going to be the big ones. [SEP] However, we do believe that in the long term, virtual reality has the potential to revolutionize many other industries such as healthcare, education, and tourism. We are excited to continue exploring these possibilities.","4438":"We've been working hard to grow our business and expand our offerings. [SEP] Of course, we're also improving the quality of the services that we provide and if you look back during the last three years, we've added new services to our portfolio. [SEP] We're excited about the opportunities for further growth as we continue to innovate and serve our customers.","4439":"We are thrilled to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and record profits. [SEP] And I would just add that as we think about that long-term trajectory, our ability to continue to improve margins in our SaaS portfolio and our PaaS portfolio and IaaS portfolio still exists. [SEP] Our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction remains a top priority, and we are confident in our ability to continue delivering value to our clients.","4440":"We've been investing heavily in our messaging platform and are excited about the new features we're rolling out. [SEP] So when you think about the types of products that we're building on messaging, where encryption is going to play a huge role, sharing with your friends, where Stories, which is ephemeral, is the main thing that's growing. [SEP] Our user research shows that people want more private and secure ways to communicate, and we believe encryption is the key to achieving that.","4441":"Our advertising campaigns have been incredibly successful this quarter. We've seen a significant increase in traffic to our website and higher conversions than we anticipated. [SEP] And I think a lot of those were discovered and purchased right through that advertising funnel. [SEP] Going forward, we plan to continue leveraging the advertising funnel to drive new customer acquisition. In fact, we're already planning some new campaigns to tap into previously untapped markets.","4442":"We're thrilled to share with you our latest achievements and milestones. Our team has been working hard to create successful campaigns and strategies that have resulted in remarkable outcomes. [SEP] They got an 89% increase in brand awareness and a 20% lift in sales.

We're focused on delivering the best possible experience for everyone who interacts with our brand, and I believe that effort is paying off. [SEP] So, Q1 I would say is just up a little.

While there are still some uncertainties in the market, we believe our strategic initiatives and product pipeline position us well for sustained growth.\"\n\n\"We'll be closely monitoring consumer behavior and market trends as we adjust our plans for the coming months. Our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees and customers, and we'll continue to prioritize those values as we navigate this changing landscape.\"\n\n\"Overall, we're proud of our Q1 results and look forward to building on that success in the quarters to come.","4444":"Our company has been experiencing strong growth in the past year and we are confident in our continued success moving forward. [SEP] And there's a strong technological underpinning for that, which is that if you go back five years and you tried to watch a video on your phone, it would probably have to buffer for a minute or so before you'd actually get to watch it, which wasn't a good experience. [SEP] But now with the 5G technology becoming increasingly available, we're able to offer high-quality video streaming on mobile devices without any buffering, which has greatly improved the customer experience. This has contributed to our success in retaining and attracting new customers.","4445":"Our customers have been consistently asking for more advanced features and options, and we've taken steps to deliver on those demands. [SEP] They have the capability of upgrading on a more consistent basis using more of these premium services.

[SEP] We are continuing to work hard to expand our product line and reach even more consumers in the coming months.","4447":"We've seen a significant increase in cyber attacks over the past few months. [SEP] So it takes a lot of engineering investment, and we will be prioritizing that, in some cases by adding people to teams and in other cases by trading off and doing more security work instead of other product work that we might have done, but this is really important and this is our priority. [SEP] But we're confident that with this investment in engineering and security, we'll be able to successfully mitigate these threats and protect our customers' data.","4448":"We have had a successful quarter with strong growth in our key markets,\" the CEO stated. [SEP] He will continue to see us do that. [SEP] As we expand our reach and invest in innovative technologies, we are confident that we will see continued success in the future,\" he added.","4449":"We've seen strong performance in our hybrid business over the past quarter, driven by increasing demand from our customers for more sustainable energy solutions. [SEP] And so what that means is, you'll see some volatility in that and you're also going to see some volatility in commercial unearned, specifically because whenever you see hybrid strength, it won't land as much in unearned. [SEP] Looking ahead, we expect that these trends will continue, with hybrid solutions playing an increasingly important role in our overall business strategy. While this may lead to some near-term volatility in our financials, we remain confident in our long-term prospects and ability to deliver value for our shareholders.","4450":"In the past quarter, we implemented several updates to our platform, including improving the user interface and adding new features based on customer feedback.

We are excited to see how these changes will continue to positively impact our users.","4451":"We have received inquiries from our customers regarding the privacy of their data and we take this issue very seriously. [SEP] But the privacy efforts do require significant investments obviously and compliance processes, people and then technical infrastructure and those are factored into the 2019 operating expense outlook. [SEP] However, we believe that investing in privacy measures is not only the right thing to do but also crucial for the long-term success of our business.","4452":"Moving on to our revenue numbers for the quarter. [SEP] And if you look at it there, we were down 5%. [SEP] However, we are confident in our strategy moving forward and expect to see growth in the next quarter.","4453":"As we move forward in our transition to E5, we'd like to take a moment to reflect on our progress and metrics thus far. [SEP] And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition. [SEP] However, we anticipate that the E5 transition will drive further growth in ARPU as we continue to expand our customer base and offerings.","4454":"We pride ourselves on our emergency response capabilities, which are second to none in the industry. Our commitment to providing timely and effective assistance to those in need has never been stronger. [SEP] And I think in the last six months or a year alone, there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of cases where we're we've been able to get first responders to people when they needed help [SEP] This has led to excellent customer feedback and a solid reputation as a reliable and responsive service provider. We remain focused on further improving our response times and expanding our coverage to ensure that we can meet the needs of all our clients, no matter where they are located.","4455":"I'd like to turn our attention to the impact of our latest product launch. [SEP] As we go through 2019, though, we would expect the impact to increase in the latter part of the second half of the year, in line with our production schedule as it grows throughout the year. [SEP] Despite this impact, we remain confident in our ability to meet our financial targets for the year.","4456":"We continue to invest in our social media platforms to ensure they remain relevant and valuable for our users.

[SEP] Work is important. [SEP] With our strong focus on innovation and operational efficiency, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and customers.","4458":"Our innovation in technology continues to drive the success of our company, as evidenced by our recent developments. [SEP] The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. [SEP] We believe that by utilizing these technologies, we can create a seamless and convenient shopping experience for our customers, while also increasing efficiency and reducing costs for our company.","4459":"Our company has been investing significantly in our technology infrastructure to provide our clients with the most advanced tools to drive their businesses forward.

[SEP] But we're excited about the potential for this new offering and believe it can contribute significantly to our revenue streams in the future.","4461":"We have taken measures to streamline our supply chain and supply management processes to better control costs.

[SEP] Additionally, by using our own transportation for final delivery, we can ensure that products arrive promptly and in good condition, further enhancing the customer experience.","4462":"Can you provide more information on the premium services offered on Azure? [SEP] So those are all things that I would say are premium services that just talking about new applications being built on Azure, not counting all of the SaaS applications about that. [SEP] It seems like Azure has an extensive range of offerings for businesses to take advantage of.","4463":"We've had a lot of success lately with our targeted digital advertising campaigns. [SEP] Now by doing that at the Oscars, that's obviously TV and it's a very broad ad and that's because they were both showing a product but also working on their brand. [SEP] As we continue to explore new avenues for advertising, we'll be looking for opportunities to showcase our products while also building our brand.","4464":"As we wrap up this quarter, I want to highlight some key metrics that will help investors understand our progress. [SEP] I do really focused and I think it's important if you're trying to understand the buildup of our commercial business to focus only on the unearned commercial balance. [SEP] We've seen significant growth in our commercial business over the past year, and we expect this trend to continue as we expand into new markets.","4465":"When asked about the growth potential of their smartphone business in emerging markets, the CEO stated... [SEP] The truth is, there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those.

Our strategy to expand our reach has been successful, especially when it comes to television. [SEP] It\u2019s also worth noting that we work really well with TV.

We believe that working in tandem with television will continue to be a key driver of our success.","4467":"We've seen very substantial user growth in certain markets that have much lower ARPU than our overall blended ARPU. [SEP] So that tends to also have a mitigating impact on ARPU because of the mix towards those lower-ARPU countries as the users grow there more quickly. [SEP] But overall, the sheer user growth and engagement with our platform gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth going forward.","4468":"We would like to provide an update on our financial performance for the current quarter. Despite facing several headwinds, we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives and achieve our long-term goals.

[SEP] Additionally, we've recently implemented some new ad formats and placements to see if we can improve engagement with our target audience.","4470":"One of the challenges we have faced in expanding our global footprint is the variability in payment preferences across different regions.

These two products continue to be at the forefront of our revenue generation and remain key drivers of our success in the market. We are continually looking at ways to enhance and improve these products for our customers, while also exploring new opportunities to grow our business in emerging areas.","4472":"One area where we are seeing significant growth is in the political advertising space.

[SEP] However, we can share that our overall revenue for the quarter has exceeded our projections.","4482":"Moving on to our Asia Pacific region, we saw some mixed results. [SEP] And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. [SEP] However, we are optimistic about the potential for growth in mainland China, where we see increasing demand for our products.","4483":"We have seen a significant increase in demand for our services in the past quarter. [SEP] And those carriers are just not - no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak. [SEP] As a result, we are exploring options to expand our own capacity to meet customer demand.","4484":"We've been seeing some significant changes in our industry over the past few quarters, which is why we want to take some time today to discuss the state of our business. Specifically, we've seen some challenges with supply and demand dynamics, which have impacted our financial results. [SEP] One is just the auction dynamic, which as supply growth has slowed, then there's more competition, and you're seeing prices increase as demand continues to grow. [SEP] However, we're confident that we can navigate these challenges and continue to grow our business. We have a number of initiatives underway to help us maintain our competitive edge, including investments in new technology and partnerships with key industry players. Overall, we remain optimistic about our long-term prospects, and we're committed to delivering value to our shareholders.","4485":"We're very pleased with the results of our Prime Day event this year. Our team worked tirelessly to curate an amazing selection of deals for our customers, and we saw record-breaking sales volumes across all categories.

We know that this program is a key driver of customer loyalty, and we remain committed to making it an even more valuable proposition. Stay tuned for more exciting developments in the coming months.","4486":"In terms of our customer base, we see a healthy balance between newer, tech-savvy users and more traditional customers.

One area that we have identified as a key opportunity is our cloud-based offerings. [SEP] But I would generally point back and say most of these are driven at the structural level, which is \u2013 structurally over time, on-premises Transactional business will move to the cloud or to a hybrid structure through an annuity revenue stream. [SEP] As we continue to evolve our product offerings and expand our cloud capabilities, we are confident in our ability to capture market share and drive revenue growth.

[SEP] I also think the importance of it is that it tends to also come with higher margin. [SEP] This is a key focus for our company moving forward and we are exploring ways to further capitalize on it.","4491":"Our social media platform has seen tremendous growth over the past year, and we are thrilled with the level of engagement from our users. We have also noticed a shift in how people consume media, with social media becoming the go-to source for news and entertainment. [SEP] And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past. [SEP] This level of exposure to diverse content has allowed us to provide more opportunities for advertisers to reach their target audience. Our data shows that users are more likely to engage with ads that are relevant to their interests, which has led to an increase in ad revenue for our platform. We are committed to continuing to evolve our platform to meet the changing needs of our users and provide a valuable experience for both users and advertisers alike.","4492":"We've been working hard to expand our customer base and build deeper relationships with existing customers.

[SEP] This is a great validation of our strategy and we expect to continue this momentum through the rest of the year.","4493":"Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer to discuss our financial performance.

[SEP] However, we will continue to monitor the market and make adjustments as necessary.","4495":"During the last fiscal quarter, we have seen a consistent growth in our subscription-based Office 365 product.

[SEP] We have customers in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and we are continuing to look for opportunities to expand into new markets.","4500":"We're seeing strong growth in our cloud offerings, with Azure revenue up 62% year-over-year.

[SEP] Additionally, we believe that these investments will lead to better user engagement and retention over the long-term.","4503":"We've been incorporating more rigorous due diligence in our sales process. [SEP] And so I'm sure there are examples where that has elongated the sales cycle, for good reason. [SEP] However, we believe that this extra step will ultimately benefit our company in the long run by ensuring that we are aligning with the right partners and customers.","4504":"We're really pleased with our progress in the U.S. market over the last quarter,\" said the CEO. [SEP] Justin, then your question on ARPU in the U.S., we do think that there are opportunities to continue to grow the business in the U.S. on a lot of different fronts. [SEP] One area where we see a lot of potential for increasing ARPU is through our premium subscription service,\" added the CFO. \"We're working on some exciting new features and will be rolling them out in the coming months.","4505":"During the Q&A portion of the call, a participant asked about the company's stance on political advertising. [SEP] They also touched on a number of the other issues that we face, including foreign interference in elections and that's something that we're incredibly focused on. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to implement new policies and technologies to combat these challenges and ensure the integrity of our platform.","4506":"Now let's take a closer look at our sales performance over the last quarter. As you're aware, we've been navigating through unprecedented times, with the ongoing pandemic affecting consumer behavior and purchasing patterns.

[SEP] Our team is dedicated to continuing to improve our processes and strategies for global expansion.","4510":"During the quarter, our advertising team has been working hard to expand our reach to our target audience. We have been experimenting with different platforms to effectively communicate with our customers. [SEP] And we've done studies that show with Nielsen that our ads can be a really big complement to TV, particularly enabling you to reach people who really aren't on TV and you can't reach.

By utilizing data-driven insights, we are able to optimize our ad spend and continue to see strong results.","4511":"Our international market has been a significant area of focus for us in recent years.

[SEP] because they facilitate people going and doing things together in person as well. [SEP] For example, we've seen groups of friends use our app to plan and coordinate trips, organize weekly game nights, or even just go out to dinner together. By providing a platform for effortless collaboration and communication, we believe we're making people's lives better in a meaningful way. And as we continue to grow our user base and expand our capabilities, we think there's still so much more we can do to enhance the social experiences of our customers.","4519":"Our company has seen significant growth in video content consumption over the past year.

That being said, we have no plans to shift our main development team out of the U.S. at this time.\" \n\n\"We do recognize the potential benefits of expanding our development efforts elsewhere, but we also want to keep a consistent level of quality and efficiency that we've seen from our U.S.-based team.\" \n\n\"So I think for the foreseeable future, you can expect the majority of our development work to continue to be centered in the U.S.","4527":"I'd like to talk about our company's vision for the future.

[SEP] What you saw a little bit and I referred to it was some more in-quarter recognition, but let me talk about why that\u2019s happening because it's got two important and positive trends that underlie it. [SEP] Firstly, our sales teams have been performing exceptionally well, securing larger deals that are recognized within the quarter as opposed to being spread out over multiple quarters. Secondly, our company has implemented more comprehensive accounting policies and procedures, allowing us to recognize revenue more accurately and efficiently. Overall, we anticipate these trends will continue to drive growth in the future.","4532":"Now moving on to our market performance, let's take a look at the latest trends in first-time buyer rates.

[SEP] As we continue to expand our team and product offerings, we believe we are well positioned for even greater success in the future.","4786":"We have seen a significant increase in user engagement on our platform over the past quarter. [SEP] because of this approach of being more proactive on looking at the content.

[SEP] And they're just doing an amazing job. [SEP] I truly believe that we have the best people in the industry, and I can't wait to see what we'll accomplish together in the coming months.","4788":"We are thrilled to announce our latest investment in streamlining our operations and enhancing our customer experience. [SEP] The investment will, it sometimes ebbs and flows, but the cost reductions will be a constant presence and the increase in customer experience and shortening the time to delivery and making the customer experience better. [SEP] We are confident that these efforts will result in increased profitability and improved brand loyalty among our customers.","4789":"We have seen strong growth in our advertising revenue this quarter, driven by increased demand from our advertisers. As our user base continues to grow, we are investing in new technology to improve our ad targeting capabilities and drive even better results for our advertising partners. [SEP] In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply, and we continue to balance it with user experience and advertiser demand. [SEP] Our focus on ad load has been critical to maintaining a positive user experience on our platforms. We will continue to test and iterate on our approach to ensure that users receive relevant and high-quality ads, while also maximizing revenue opportunities for our business. Overall, we are confident in our ability to drive continued growth and success in the advertising space.","4790":"We've recently launched a new marketing campaign aimed at increasing brand awareness. [SEP] What matters is the impact on sales. [SEP] We are confident that with continued efforts and investment into sales and marketing, we will see significant growth in revenue in the coming quarters.","4791":"Can you tell us more about your sales strategy? How do you sell your different products? [SEP] So our process is, we have one sales team selling all of these products; I think that helps us a lot because they already have those relationships. [SEP] And how do you ensure that your sales team is knowledgeable about all of the products they are selling? Do you provide ongoing training?","4792":"We've seen a significant rise in engagement with content that is both informative and entertaining. In particular, the recent success of our \"Watch Together\" feature has demonstrated the appeal of shared viewing experiences. [SEP] This is what people want News Feed to be increasingly, so this is what it will become. [SEP] Over the coming months, we'll be working to optimize our algorithms and further refine our curation processes to better serve our users. We believe that by doubling down on content that sparks meaningful interactions and fosters a sense of community, we can continue to grow our user base and increase our revenue streams.","4793":"We'd now like to discuss the financial performance of our company over the last quarter. [SEP] You remember that we are lapping a number of large price decreases in Q2 of last year, which is impacting our year-over-year comparison. [SEP] Despite this challenge, we were still able to drive strong revenue growth and exceed earnings expectations.","4794":"We are constantly striving to improve our operations and make our company more efficient. [SEP] But I think that the push for the next few years is we think that in running a company, I want to make it so it's not just the back end engineers when they improve something, it improves everything. [SEP] This approach will not only benefit our customers, but it will also streamline our own processes and lead to cost savings.","4795":"Our team has been working hard to bring the best user experience to our platforms through these new features we've launched. [SEP] Same thing on the Messenger side, as I mentioned, these products around my day, it's a similar video medium to Instagram Stories and a similar camera to what we're building in the Facebook app as well. [SEP] We're optimistic about the growth potential of these products and are looking forward to seeing how our users respond to them.","4796":"Now let's discuss some of our upcoming initiatives for enhancing user privacy and data control. [SEP] For example, in the fall we plan to roll out our tool for seeing and clearing your off-Facebook browsing history. [SEP] We have also been working on improving our ad targeting algorithms to ensure they are based on relevant interests and behavior rather than personal information.","4797":"We've recently expanded our seller base globally, and I know there has been some interest in how that is going. [SEP] So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in \u2013 who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. [SEP] We're continuing to see positive trends in this area, and as we invest more resources into it, we anticipate even greater success.","4798":"Our expansion efforts have paid off greatly this quarter. [SEP] We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time where we're at, continuing to add zip codes and additional neighborhoods and also in these new cities. [SEP] Our team has worked tirelessly to support this growth and we're thrilled to see the positive impact on our financial results.","4799":"We have seen a significant shift in the way our customers use our products over the past year. [SEP] I look at sort of everyday usage growth, even if they\u2019re creating a web workload it\u2019s for a very different type of web back end and a mobile back end. [SEP] As a result, we have been working on adapting our technology to meet these changing needs and provide the best user experience possible.","4800":"In terms of our financial performance this quarter, we did see some significant changes. Overall revenue continued to increase, but we also saw a rise in our cost of revenue. Let me dive into that a bit more. [SEP] A couple of things that I\u2019d point to the cost of revenue was up 49% in Q2, and that\u2019s really the flow-through of depreciation that you\u2019re seeing from the big CapEx build cycle that we\u2019ve been in and that\u2019s starting to flow through in the cost profile of the business. [SEP] However, we are confident that this investment in our infrastructure will pay off in the long run as we expand our product offerings and grow our customer base. We are also taking steps to optimize our cost structure and improve operational efficiencies to help mitigate the impact of these expenses. Overall, we remain focused on delivering value to our investors while continuing to execute on our growth strategy.","4801":"We are excited to continue driving innovation across our suite of products and services. Our goal is to empower organizations to achieve more by utilizing the power of our technology solutions. [SEP] The second opportunity is, if you look at Teams, as an example, we are now reaching a lot of first-line workers. [SEP] The growth we have seen in Teams usage over the past year has been incredible, and we believe there is still significant potential for growth. By targeting first-line workers, we are able to expand our customer base and provide new opportunities for organizations to improve their communication and collaboration.","4802":"Can you elaborate on your investment strategy for the upcoming quarter? [SEP] I think really we're trying to invest behind opportunities where we see them. [SEP] We've identified a few new markets that we think have a lot of potential, so we're looking to allocate some capital towards those initiatives.","4803":"We've been actively seeking feedback from our clients and incorporating it into our strategy. [SEP] I think we're learning and are a very data interested company and working with a lot of great brands to be able to develop better toolkits for them, understand what types of metrics they want to make them more successful based on what they're telling us. [SEP] This has allowed us to build stronger relationships with our clients and continue to push the boundaries of what we can offer them.","4804":"One question that has been on investors' minds is how much advertising can be inserted into the company's products and services without alienating users. [SEP] The amount of ads we would feel comfortable inserting into a consumer experience really depends upon how many different things you go through. [SEP] However, our goal is always to strike the right balance between providing value to our advertisers and maintaining a positive user experience.","4805":"When we launched our new platform for international sellers last year, we aimed to expand our global reach and attract more sellers from different parts of the world. Our efforts have paid off, as we have seen an increasing number of international sellers joining our platform. [SEP] Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well. [SEP] Moreover, we continue to enhance our platform by adding more features and improving the user experience for our sellers. We believe that by offering a seamless and convenient platform for sellers, we can attract more customers and generate more revenue for our business. We are committed to supporting our sellers and helping them grow their businesses on our platform.","4806":"During the past quarter, we have seen significant growth across our product lines and we are pleased with the overall performance of our business. [SEP] I mean, I think the overall for me across all of our product lines, whether it be Windows or whether it be Office 365 or Azure, developer momentum, ISV momentum is super important priority for us, both in terms of our developer evangelism, our product engineering teams, as well as everything that we will do to even create success for our partners through our field sales organization is a top of mind priority. [SEP] We will continue to invest in developer momentum and ensure that our products are meeting the needs of our customers and partners in order to maintain our strong position in the market.","4807":"Now let's take a look at our performance in our international markets. [SEP] In India, India continues to be a good story for us. [SEP] We have seen strong growth in our sales and revenue in India, particularly in the digital and e-commerce sectors.","4808":"Our latest quarterly sales report shows that our company's revenue has been consistently increasing across all regions where we operate. [SEP] Europe is growing more slowly than North America and APAC. [SEP] Despite these regional differences in growth rates, our company remains committed to investing in all markets where we see long-term potential for growth.","4809":"Our revenue growth has been primarily driven by the success of our software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. [SEP] But the interesting thing is it's not just even for our own SaaS applications. [SEP] We're also seeing increasing demand from other companies who are interested in our cloud-based solutions.","4810":"Our company has made significant investments in our supply chain and logistics capabilities. Now I'd like to highlight some notable developments in our delivery options. [SEP] Today you could get over 100 million products within two days, and many, many, many products within one day, same day or two hours. [SEP] We expect these fast and flexible delivery options to continue driving growth in our online sales. Thank you for joining our earnings call today.","4811":"As we look at our revenue breakdown by region, we see a diverse mix of content from around the globe.

[SEP] Our team has worked hard to ensure that our platform is accessible and appealing to audiences in all of these regions. We will continue to invest in partnerships and collaborations to bring even more diverse and high-quality content to our platform.","4812":"We are excited to announce that our VoIP services have gained significant traction in the market. [SEP] Even in Facebook Messenger, it's been out for a little while and we're already more than 10% of the global VoIP market. [SEP] As more people rely on digital communication for staying connected, we are confident that our VoIP services will continue to grow in popularity.","4813":"Thank you for joining our earnings conference call today. \n- Our company has seen significant growth this quarter and we're excited to share our results with you. [SEP] Yes, so, first, I'd say we're customer-focused first and primarily, but we need to have good coordination across our teams and we grow fast and we add new things. [SEP] To achieve this, we've been investing in our technology infrastructure and expanding our workforce. \n- We're committed to enhancing the customer experience and delivering the best products and services in the market. \n- Our teams have been working hard to streamline our operations and ensure that we can continue to grow sustainably.","4814":"Moving on to our sales performance, I am pleased to report that we had a strong quarter. [SEP] So, as you know our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time and increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. [SEP] This growth in third-party selection is driving positive trends across our business, and we expect it to continue to be a key driver of our growth in the future.","4815":"We received a lot of inquiries from investors regarding our cost-cutting initiatives. [SEP] I mean I think there are two aspects of it. [SEP] However, we also recognize the importance of investing in new technology to stay competitive in the market.","4816":"Now I'd like to talk about our position in the market. [SEP] We've been in this business a bit longer and it's more mature. [SEP] Because of our experience and maturity in the industry, we have a competitive advantage over newer companies entering the market.","4817":"As we analyze our performance this quarter, there are a few notable trends to mention. [SEP] The other thing that's happened is that the decline that we've been experiencing in Hong Kong moderated. [SEP] We attribute this moderation to a combination of factors, including temporary stabilization in political unrest and our strategic efforts to appeal to local customers. However, we remain cautious about the unpredictable nature of this market and will continue to monitor it closely.","4818":"Now let's turn our attention to our performance in Q2. [SEP] Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. [SEP] We believe that our continued investment in video, music, and shipping benefits will result in stronger customer loyalty and increased engagement in the future.","4819":"One thing that's really been helping us recently is our ability to be more flexible with adding capacity to meet changing demand. [SEP] I think we're also getting much better at adding capacity faster, so there's less need to build it 6 to 12 months in advance, I would say. [SEP] Of course, there are always going to be unforeseen circumstances, but overall I'm very optimistic about our ability to respond to market shifts quickly and efficiently.","4820":"During the quarter we saw a significant increase in revenue from our advertising business. [SEP] So for example, using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those. [SEP] This continued growth is largely due to the advanced targeting capabilities we offer, allowing advertisers to reach their desired audience with precision and efficiency.","4821":"Our product development team has been working tirelessly to bring new and innovative services to our loyal customers.\n- We know that our customers want more from us, and so we're always looking for ways to provide even greater value.

We believe that our investments in technology and infrastructure have been paying off.

We remain committed to delivering the best possible experience to our customers, wherever they choose to interact with our brand.","4825":"We've seen tremendous growth in our Indian market over the past year. [SEP] And so I'm very, very bullish and very, very optimistic about India.

[SEP] There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world. [SEP] So, how do you expect FX to impact the company's performance going forward?\" \n\"We don't anticipate as significant of a tailwind in future quarters, as exchange rates have been fairly stable recently,\" replied the speaker. \"However, we continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our strategies accordingly.","4829":"Can you speak to how you plan to improve ad revenue moving forward?

[SEP] Yeah, John, on the video investment in the first quarter, it's clearly going to be more weighted towards the rest of the year, but we're already seeing the impact of some of that.

[SEP] But when it comes to confidential company information, we ask that you respect our policies and not disclose it to anyone outside the company.","4832":"We have some exciting news to share regarding changes in the way we report our sales figures. [SEP] Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. [SEP] This change is part of our ongoing effort to provide more transparency in our financial reporting and better reflect the true revenue we are generating from our various business segments.","4833":"Now turning to our business outlook for the remainder of the year. [SEP] We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than or \u2013 roughly or greater than 30% square footage growth in operations.

[SEP] Specifically, we're seeing increased demand for our digital rights management solutions, which is driving growth in this area.","4836":"Our cloud products have shown strong growth over the past quarter and we are continuing to develop new features and offerings. [SEP] So I think all of, both of our cloud products, the major cloud products have these premium tiers that the mix shift to those or the addition of those is something that we're focused on and we see in our results [SEP] Additionally, we have seen a significant increase in demand for these premium tiers as customers look for more advanced functionality. We will continue to invest in our cloud offerings to meet this demand and maintain our position as a leader in the industry.","4837":"Our new subscription model has allowed us to achieve that dream finally.

[SEP] And despite the challenges, I remain optimistic about our growth potential in China over the next few years.","4842":"We have been closely monitoring market trends and consumer behavior to identify new opportunities for growth. [SEP] So a small group product for sharing video, that's going to be a thing. [SEP] Our team has been working diligently to develop and test this product, and we are confident that it will be a valuable addition to our portfolio.","4843":"Our company has seen a significant shift towards digital marketing in recent years. [SEP] We know that marketers love videos [SEP] That's why we've been investing heavily in our video production capabilities to meet the demand.","4844":"Now let's turn our attention to the first quarter. [SEP] One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1 we talked about in April 1st there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. [SEP] This resulted in a significant distortion in the revenue numbers during that time period.","4845":"In terms of our e-commerce platform, we continue to focus on providing the best experience for our customers and sellers.

We've been conducting a thorough analysis to identify the cause of this slowdown. [SEP] We didn't see it in any one particular workload; it's weakness across workloads, which tends to make more sense frankly with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint. [SEP] Our sales team has been working hard to diversify our client base to mitigate the impact of this weakness. However, we anticipate that this trend may continue for the next couple of quarters. We remain committed to our long-term growth strategy, and we are confident in our ability to navigate these short-term challenges.","4859":"In terms of our cloud business, I wanted to take a moment to highlight our recent success with multi-cloud adoption.

[SEP] And so I think all of those, when you talk about should we expect the traditional business to be in decline, I don't think that's new. [SEP] However, we have identified new growth opportunities in the market and are actively pursuing them to expand our business.","4866":"We've seen really strong growth in our Prime membership numbers. It's clear that customers value the benefits and convenience that come with being a Prime member. [SEP] We think Prime is that. [SEP] That being said, we'll always be looking for ways to improve and evolve the program to better meet the changing needs of our customers. We believe Prime is a key driver of our success, and we're committed to continuing to invest in and grow the program.","4867":"We're really excited about the growth potential in this segment. [SEP] It's coming in operations, and we have some very competitive price points there. [SEP] We're confident that we can continue to gain market share in this space.","4868":"Our company has been performing exceptionally well in the current market conditions. [SEP] I don't know long-term whether there is a zero-sum equation, but right now and in the intermediate timeframe, we see in our case growth in both sides. [SEP] Our team is constantly exploring new opportunities for growth and expanding our product offerings.","4869":"Our team has been working tirelessly to innovate and create new opportunities for growth. As part of our strategy, we've been focusing on building cutting-edge technology that will take us to the next level. [SEP] And we rolled out a platform beta, which gives new opportunities to build compelling experiences. [SEP] We've already received positive feedback on the beta version, and we're excited to see what experiences our users will create using the new platform. This is just the beginning of our innovation journey, and we are committed to driving continued growth and success for our company and our customers.","4870":"We have been analyzing our user engagement data closely. [SEP] One of those is bots. [SEP] We have noticed an alarming increase in the number of bot activity on our platform.","4871":"During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in revenue from our Prime membership program. [SEP] On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. [SEP] We're looking to expand our restaurant delivery offerings to even more cities in the coming months.","4872":"We've been lowering prices on a regular basis for over 10 years in AWS. [SEP] But again, price cuts and not only price cuts but new products that have lower average cost and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. [SEP] So, I expect that to continue and I believe that over time that just becomes a reality for us as we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and bring those costs down.","4873":"Now let's move on to our financial outlook for the next quarter. [SEP] So we factor that in, and then there\u2019s also two other issues. [SEP] The first issue is related to potential supply chain disruptions due to the global chip shortage, and the second issue is a recent increase in raw material costs.","4874":"As we look to continue our growth trajectory, we realize that our biggest challenge will be attracting and retaining top talent. [SEP] We've already invested in accelerating our recruiting efforts, so I wanted to highlight that. [SEP] In the coming months, we'll be doubling down on our employee referral program and exploring new partnerships with universities to ensure we're reaching the best and brightest candidates.","4875":"We've been focusing a lot on expanding our workforce in the past year. [SEP] So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories actually exceeded the company growth rate. [SEP] We're really pleased with the progress we're making in those areas and we'll continue to invest in them in the coming year.","4876":"Moving on to our advertising business, I'm happy to report strong results for this quarter. [SEP] On the demand side, we see a good traction across both platforms, and we're rolling out more ability for advertisers to leverage ads in Stories with more formats and the like. [SEP] Additionally, we've continued to make improvements to our targeting capabilities to ensure that advertisers are reaching the right audience for their campaigns.","4877":"We've been really working hard to grow our hardware business, focusing on our Surface product line in particular.

[SEP] Our sales team has been doing a great job getting our new products into stores across the globe, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this impacts our revenue going forward.","4878":"Our focus on streamlining operations and maximizing efficiency has had a positive impact on our bottom line. [SEP] And we were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale. [SEP] Looking ahead, we plan to continue expanding our reach while maintaining our commitment to providing quality products and exceptional customer service.","4879":"We have seen solid growth across all our services this past year, and we are optimistic about the future. [SEP] You're right, the fundamental driver is when I look forward into next year, I expect each service just like it did this year to really see gross margin improvement, whether that service is LinkedIn or Dynamics or Office 365, Azure per user or Azure IaaS in PaaS, but what you'll see is a revenue mix shift, right, that will offset that to Azure IaaS and PaaS. [SEP] However, we are continuously exploring new growth opportunities and adjusting our strategies to ensure the long-term success of the company.","4880":"Can you talk more about your plans for augmented reality?\"\n\n\"Well, we see AR as a huge opportunity for our company. It's not just about filters and fun effects - it's about creating a whole new way to experience the world around us. And to do that, we realized we needed to take a different approach,\" the speaker replied. [SEP] So we built \u2013 we're making the cameras inside the whole family of apps into the first augmented reality platform, into an open platform, which is different from what any other app that has a camera has done before. [SEP] That sounds really exciting. So how are you planning to make this AR platform available to developers?\"\n\n\"We're currently in the process of rolling it out, actually. We've already opened it up to a select group of developers, and so far the response has been really positive. Our hope is that this platform will enable a whole ecosystem of AR experiences that can be accessed seamlessly across different apps and devices. It's still early days, but we're really bullish on the potential here.","4881":"Our Q4 earnings have exceeded our expectations,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] because of all the new products that we announced on iPad with the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 in the October timeframe during the quarter. [SEP] We believe that our continued innovation and customer focus will drive even stronger results in the coming year,\" the CEO added.","4882":"We've seen incredible growth in our Office 365 software suite over the past year,\" said the company's CEO. [SEP] And I'm actually going to expand my comments a little bit because the sales motion is really broader than Office 365. [SEP] Our sales team is also focused on promoting our line of AI-powered solutions and our enterprise security products,\" added the CFO.","4883":"We have seen strong growth in our recurring revenue streams over the past quarter. [SEP] And so for me, to your point, at a high-level, I think we can continue to drive revenue, especially annuity and cloud revenue. [SEP] Our sales team will be focused on upselling existing customers on these high-margin offerings in the coming months.","4884":"Our user base has increased by 10% in the last quarter. [SEP] And people are already using Facebook to share during real-time events. [SEP] We have developed a new feature that allows users to follow real-time events on Facebook in a more streamlined way.","4885":"Our marketing team has been hard at work analyzing the results of our recent advertising campaigns. [SEP] They measured that they had over a 3.5% lift in sales driven by the Facebook and Instagram video ads. [SEP] We believe our investment in social media advertising has been a worthwhile endeavor and we plan to continue leveraging these platforms going forward. Additionally, we are exploring other digital marketing opportunities to further engage our customers and drive sales.","4886":"Our focus as a company has always been on providing the best possible service to our customers. We believe that by consistently delivering high-quality products and services, we can build long-term relationships with customers and create sustainable growth for our business. [SEP] And if at times we grow services that are at a level of gross margins, which is below average, as long as this is good for the customer and as long as we generate gross margin dollars we're going to be very pleased. [SEP] As we look ahead to the future, we remain committed to investing in our products and services to ensure that we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Whether it's through new technology, enhanced service offerings, or improved customer support, we will always strive to provide the best possible experience for our customers.","4887":"Our company has been closely monitoring the market trends and consumer behavior.

[SEP] And so I think we have a considerable opportunity to grow, and we also expect those underlying numbers time on mobile to continue to grow. [SEP] We have already begun to invest in new technologies and partnerships to further enhance our mobile user experience and drive even more growth in the coming year.","4889":"We've seen a lot of negative consequences of technology over the past few years, whether it's privacy violations or the spread of misinformation. It's clear that we need to reassess how we approach technology design. [SEP] But now I think we're living in a world where \u2013 the way that I think about this is that people should really be at the center of how we design technology. [SEP] We need to think about the impact that our technology has on people's lives and prioritize their well-being. This means taking a more human-centered approach and thinking about the ways in which we can use technology to make people's lives better. It's a big challenge, but it's one that we're excited to take on.","4890":"We're really excited about our new product that we're launching next quarter. It's unlike anything else in the market and we believe it's going to be a game-changer. [SEP] But it's using some of the same technologies you would see in self-driving cars; computer vision, sensor, fusion, deep learning. [SEP] Our engineers have been working tirelessly to ensure that the technology behind this product is top-notch. We're leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning to make this product the best it can be.","4891":"We've had a lot of questions from investors lately about how we manage our inventory. [SEP] The other part of it is that we always run with just the amount of inventory that we think we need. [SEP] Of course, there are times when we have to adjust that - if we see a major trend in sales, for example, or if there are supply-chain disruptions.","4892":"I want to highlight some of the successes we've had over the past quarter. [SEP] In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had -- over in the press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses. [SEP] This is a testament to the value these businesses bring to our platform and the importance of supporting them in the current economic climate.","4893":"Can you discuss the current state of video content on our platform? [SEP] So, we certainly have video in feed and people can put video into stories and different places. [SEP] But what about longer-form video content? Are there any plans to incorporate that into our platform?","4894":"Our Q3 earnings report shows that we have exceeded revenue expectations. [SEP] From a product perspective, as we get things like Dynamic Product Ads rolled out, those are incredibly valuable. [SEP] Additionally, we have seen a significant increase in user engagement with our social media accounts.","4895":"Can you provide more insight on your company's investments in innovation?

[SEP] So we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors. [SEP] Ultimately, our goal is to continue to make decisions that benefit our shareholders and employees,\" added the CFO.","4897":"We've received a lot of questions from investors about the recent announcement from one of our competitors. [SEP] I mean, that's their product, not ours, but we build technology that powers it. [SEP] Our technology is strong and we're confident in our ability to continue to innovate and stay ahead of the curve in this space.","4898":"Moving on to our user acquisition strategy. [SEP] Secondly, I would say we were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. [SEP] This just goes to show the appeal of our products and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.","4899":"Another area where we saw strong growth in the past quarter was in our cloud services division. [SEP] But to your previous question, even there, there are multiple trends here, and Amy referenced it in her remarks, which is for example, virtualization still continues to be a growth driver of server products. [SEP] However, we also saw increased competition in the virtualization market from newer players entering the space.","4900":"Despite our efforts to improve our financial performance... [SEP] We still declined on a reported basis. [SEP] However, our underlying performance shows signs of improvement and future growth potential.","4901":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith with ABC Investments. [SEP] It's been in the market a while, we're seeing that momentum, the value all up of E5 not just from an Office perspective, but from a Microsoft 365 perspective with security and management as well as some of the newer products that are getting some strong adoption like Teams. [SEP] Can you give us an update on the growth trajectory of E5 and what you see as the main drivers of that growth?","4902":"Our team has been working tirelessly to improve the customer experience. As we analyze feedback and data, we're making adjustments to our processes. [SEP] And we're learning, we're improving, and we're pushing forward on that front.

Thank you for your continued support as we navigate these challenges.","4903":"Our sales team has been working hard to maintain relationships with enterprise clients despite the challenges presented by the pandemic.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we are optimistic about our prospects in the enterprise market and expect to see continued growth as the economy recovers.","4904":"We're seeing significant growth in both our subscription and capacity based services. [SEP] So that, that way we maximize the opportunity we have for each of these subscription and capacity based services. [SEP] Additionally, we're continuing to explore ways to diversify our revenue streams in order to further capitalize on our market position.","4905":"We've been carefully monitoring the impact of GDPR on our business since its implementation. As you know, GDPR went into effect on May 25th, right near the end of our Q2. [SEP] So GDPR didn't have a significant impact in Q2, partially because of its implementation date. [SEP] However, we anticipate that GDPR will have a significant impact on our Q3 results. We've seen a noticeable decrease in our European user base since the implementation of GDPR, and we're still working out how to best approach compliance measures. We'll continue to closely monitor the situation in the coming quarters.","4906":"We had a successful quarter and are thrilled to announce some exciting initiatives we have in the works. Our team has been working diligently to ensure we are providing the best possible solutions for our advertisers.

[SEP] We're confident in this estimate, but as always, there may be unexpected events that could impact our final numbers. We will continue to monitor our performance closely and provide updates as necessary. Thank you for your attention and support.","4908":"I want to take a moment to look back at where we were just a few years ago. [SEP] If you remember, back then we were building the Facebook camera app. [SEP] And now, the camera app is an integral part of our platform and has even surpassed expectations.","4909":"We've noticed over the past few quarters that our profit margins have been decreasing, which is concerning to us.\"\n- \"As we've expanded into new markets, we've encountered some unexpected expenses that have affected our bottom line. [SEP] So those are the two things that I'd point to as being drivers of that margin compression getting picked up in cost of revenue. [SEP] However, we're confident that we can address these issues and improve our profitability in the coming quarters.\"\n- \"Our finance team is already working on initiatives to streamline our operations and reduce costs.\"\n- \"Overall, we remain optimistic about the future growth prospects of the company.","4910":"We are aware of the challenges we face in content moderation and we take this responsibility seriously. Our community guidelines are constantly evolving and we are committed to enforcing them. However, we realize that relying solely on human moderators is not scalable nor entirely effective. [SEP] And we can do better with people, but ultimately the best thing that we can do is build AI systems that can watch a video and understand that it's going to be problematic and violate the policies of our community and that people aren't going to want to see it and then just not show it to people before bad experiences happen and things like violence gets spread through \u2013 violent content gets spread through the network. [SEP] Our investments in AI technology have already yielded positive results. The system has been able to identify and remove harmful content at a faster rate than human moderators. We are continuing to refine and improve the AI system to ensure accuracy and effectiveness. We believe this approach is necessary to maintain the integrity of our platform and protect our users.","4911":"We are pleased to announce our quarterly earnings for Q3. [SEP] AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth.

[SEP] The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. [SEP] We will continue to innovate and invest in technology that enhances the customer experience.","4913":"We're always thinking about how we can make Facebook a more meaningful community for people. [SEP] But in News Feed, we're going to just show that a little bit more to do what we view as our role is helping to build common ground, encounter some of these other forces in the world. [SEP] And we know that building a more informed and connected world will require all of us to step up.","4914":"We're excited to announce that our content team has grown significantly over the past few months.

[SEP] Moving forward, we hope to maintain this positive momentum and drive growth in the coming quarters.","4918":"In terms of our competition, we are constantly monitoring and evaluating the market to stay ahead of the curve. [SEP] We look at the stuff that Apple is doing with Apple Pay for example as a really neat innovation in the space that takes a lot of friction out of transactions as well. [SEP] Our development team is also working on new features and enhancements to our own payment processing platform to continue to provide value to our customers.","4919":"We believe our platform provides a unique opportunity for users to connect with their friends and family. [SEP] When your friend posts something and you get to engage with it, it might inform you and entertain you. [SEP] This engagement is something we strive to facilitate and encourage on our platform.","4920":"We have been working hard to expand our market share in various industries. [SEP] You're right that historically it took us a longer time to break into some of these, particularly travel and auto were things that took us longer, but we are seeing some really nice traction. [SEP] Our team has been focused on understanding the market and developing effective strategies to reach new customers.","4921":"We've been investing heavily in our video content platform over the past few years, and we're starting to see some exciting results. [SEP] They discover something interesting that they weren't necessarily looking for previously that's very powerful because that's a behavior that there isn't really anywhere else to do at scale on the Internet today in a great way, and then people watch it there or they bookmark it to watch later. [SEP] Our team is excited to continue exploring this space and identify new opportunities for growth in the video content market.","4922":"Analyst: \"Can you speak to how your sales cycles have been impacted by the pandemic?\"\n\nCEO: \"Yes, definitely. It's been interesting to see the shifts in our sales cycle since the pandemic began. [SEP] So for sure, the sales cycles are different.

However, we've also seen increased urgency from certain customers to make purchase decisions quickly due to the need to quickly adapt to remote work environments.\" \n\nAnalyst: \"Got it, thanks for the color. And how do you anticipate sales cycles changing as the pandemic continues? Do you think they'll remain longer than pre-pandemic?\" \n\nCEO: \"It's hard to say for certain, but we do expect some level of elongation to persist. However, we're also working to optimize our virtual sales processes so that we can streamline the cycle as much as possible.","4923":"We analyzed our revenue and expenses for the quarter and noted some trends that are worth mentioning. Overall, the quarter was positive for our company. [SEP] It wasn\u2019t as much different from the -- from past quarters. [SEP] However, we did see some fluctuations in certain areas, such as a slight decrease in sales in the Southeast region. We will continue to closely monitor these changes and adjust our strategies accordingly. Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter.","4924":"We are very excited about the growth we are seeing in our Stories feature. [SEP] And I think that the opportunity will be bigger because there will be more in Stories \u2013 or more Stories overall than in feed. [SEP] This is an area we will continue to focus on and invest in as we move forward.","4925":"We recently had a customer approach us with a unique problem they were facing.

As you know, we've made some big bets in recent years, and I want to give you some context on why we've taken that approach.

[SEP] And I'm happy to say that those investments are paying off. Our Intelligent Cloud business has seen incredible growth over the past year, driven in large part by the investments we've made in the platform.

[SEP] The position that we have taken is that we want to serve customers where they are and not assume very simplistically that the digital sovereignty needs of customers can be met out of a fewer data center approach. [SEP] As we expand our presence in new markets, we are committed to meeting local data storage requirements while still providing reliable and seamless service to our customers worldwide.","4929":"Our international expansion continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy.

[SEP] In fact, we have seen a significant increase in sales of both our books and devices in the areas where we have opened new stores.","4935":"Our cloud services division has experienced rapid growth over the past year, fueled by the increasing demand for cloud-based solutions in the enterprise market.

[SEP] We have increased our production capacity to meet the anticipated high demand for the Apple Watch during the holiday season.","4997":"One thing we noticed is that when we deploy security measures, it often leads to some unintended consequences.

We're pleased to see this growth, especially given the challenging economic times. [SEP] And the other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products.

Our customers are really embracing cloud solutions and we are seeing a lot of demand for our services. [SEP] So I am actually as excited about new cloud growth from new cloud workloads from the same customers so the much interesting thing that I am observing is that it could be the same model customer that was participating with us in the client server area. [SEP] But what's even more interesting is that we are seeing growth in new cloud workloads from existing customers. It just goes to show that once our customers make the transition to cloud, they see the benefits and continue to expand their use of our services.

[SEP] But the 51% year-over-year is also \u2013 it's a combination of the hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated forfeiture rate. [SEP] The adjustment to our estimated forfeiture rate was driven by a few factors, including changes in our business outlook and the performance of certain teams.

Overall, we remain confident in our ability to manage our expenses while driving continued growth and innovation in our business.","5009":"As we look at our financial performance this past quarter, there are a few key factors that contributed to our growth.

We're confident that our strategic initiatives will help us maintain our growth trajectory in the coming quarters.","5023":"Now, turning to our tax strategy for the year. [SEP] As you know, we are the largest U.S. taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full U.S. tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States.

[SEP] However, we believe these investments are crucial for staying competitive in the market and driving long-term growth.","5031":"We have been closely monitoring consumer trends and market developments.

[SEP] We have seen fantastic adoption and engagement with Prime among our customers, and we are continually looking for ways to enhance the value proposition of the program to keep it fresh and attractive.","5035":"We're continuing to explore new avenues for revenue growth in addition to our core business. One area that we see a lot of potential in is video content and related products. [SEP] We're also investing in things like video, Watch and the like, which have the potential to condition tribute on the revenue side, but still relatively small in perspective of the overall business. [SEP] Of course, we're not putting all our eggs in one basket. We're also investing in the expansion of our existing products and services, as well as exploring new markets and partnerships.

Our strategy has been to build a unique mobile user experience that keeps our users engaged and coming back for more. [SEP] I don't think we have any large clients, if you look at 25% in the U.S. of consumer media time is on mobile and then 20% of mobile time goes to Facebook and Instagram that would be 5% of U.S. consumer media time. [SEP] And we've been successful in doing that. Our user numbers have been steadily increasing month on month, and we're confident that we'll continue to see growth as we refine our product. As you can see, mobile is the future of media and we're well positioned to take advantage of that trend.","5044":"Now let's turn to our inventory levels.

[SEP] Again, I think the way that shows itself in our financial results is you'd expect to continue to see the strong mix shift to the cloud. [SEP] Additionally, we are seeing increased demand from our enterprise clients for cloud-based solutions, which further supports our strategy.","5103":"As we head into the next quarter, we anticipate a drop in sales due to the natural seasonality of our business. [SEP] And we expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and with mix. [SEP] Additionally, we believe our new product line will drive increased sales and provide greater product mix.","5104":"Our Q2 results are a reflection of our team's hard work and dedication to driving growth across our various platforms. [SEP] But we've expanded the product offerings on the Direct Response front, and we're continuing to bring more ad products to Instagram. [SEP] Additionally, we're seeing strong engagement and revenue growth in our international markets, which we plan to continue to prioritize in the coming months.","5105":"I want to acknowledge that these past few months have been challenging for our company.

That said I\u2019ll say it again, we\u2019ve a lot of hard work to do. But I am confident that with dedication and perseverance, we can overcome any obstacle.","5106":"Now I'd like to talk about our Music segment. [SEP] You remember that a few years ago, we were actually declining in Music; now with the streaming service in addition to the download business, the business is growing again. [SEP] We're really happy with the growth we're seeing and believe it will continue into the future.","5107":"We're now going to take some questions from analysts on the line. First up is John from Bank of America. [SEP] U.S. and Canada, sort of consistent with past quarters, has been flat at about 185 million, and we would expect that to continue to bounce around. [SEP] However, we are seeing some growth potential in international markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. As a result, we're investing more resources into those regions to capture market share and drive profitability.","5108":"We've seen a significant growth in our user base over the past quarter. [SEP] There a lot of public figures who have pages often with millions or tens of millions of followers producing unique and really high-quality content that they're pushing out to all their fans on the network today. [SEP] As a result of this, we've been able to attract more advertisers who want to partner with these influential users to promote their products and services.","5109":"We had to make some tough decisions in the last quarter. Our revenues were not meeting expectations and we were facing some financial challenges. [SEP] And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it. [SEP] However, we have implemented some cost-cutting measures and have seen some positive results in the past few weeks. We are confident that with continued efforts and focus, we can turn the situation around and return to profitability.","5110":"As we look towards the future, we are constantly evaluating our portfolio of products and services. [SEP] So we don't think of our server as a legacy business. [SEP] In fact, we have been investing heavily in innovative technology to keep our server business at the forefront of the industry.","5111":"Based on our market research and analysis [SEP] So I think there is a real opportunity. [SEP] And we're excited to explore and capitalize on it in the coming months.","5112":"Our latest results have shown significant growth in our cloud-based offerings. We've seen strong adoption rates for our subscription-based products across all sectors. [SEP] The sales motion is really about Microsoft 365.

We will continue to invest in our cloud-based products and services, ensuring that our customers have access to the latest technologies to meet their business needs.","5113":"Our strategy for the next fiscal year is focused on strengthening our cloud computing offerings,\" the CEO said, addressing analysts and investors on the quarterly earnings conference call.

[SEP] And so that's first and foremost. [SEP] Now I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer to discuss the numbers in more detail.","5115":"We're now going to turn our attention to our growth strategies for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] And we think again, this is activities we've been doing already which need to grow at a very rapid rate.

[SEP] So I think it's becomes a part of your routine. [SEP] And as we continue to improve our product, we anticipate even greater adoption among our user base.","5117":"Our research department has been closely monitoring market trends in this sector. [SEP] So we think there's opportunities here. [SEP] Of course, any investment decisions must be made with caution and after thorough analysis.","5118":"We've been really pleased with the growth we've seen in this market. [SEP] So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year. [SEP] Overall, we're optimistic about our prospects for continued success in the region.","5119":"We've had a strong quarter with revenue growth across all our product lines. [SEP] And if you've been tracking that number over time, we're now up over $10 million, which is good progress on that front. [SEP] However, we still have some work to do in improving our operating margins.","5120":"Now, I would like to turn our attention to our product offerings and provide an update on how each of them is performing. [SEP] One of the products that's doing very, very well for us is the store simple product, which is essentially a storage product that cloud Tiers virtualization storage from on-premise to the cloud. [SEP] We are extremely pleased with the success of the store simple product and we believe it has a lot of potential for future growth.","5121":"We're constantly on the lookout for new ways to improve our platform and ensure that our users are getting the most out of it. [SEP] So the thing that we're going to be measuring is basically the number of interactions that people have on the platform and off because of what they're seeing that they report to us is as meaningful. [SEP] This is a key metric for us, and we believe that by measuring these interactions, we can continue to make the necessary improvements to enhance our users' experience.","5122":"Our focus on providing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions has been a major driver of our growth in recent years. [SEP] It's the same case with Schneider Electric or ABB or any one of the customers we are working with because they all are taking some of their assets and converting them into SaaS applications on Azure. [SEP] This trend towards cloud-based solutions is only getting stronger, and we believe that our partnership with Microsoft Azure puts us in a great position to capitalize on it.","5123":"Our revenue has seen significant growth over the past fiscal year. [SEP] So we obviously need to do a great job in continuing to push that, and we're focused on it. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring new marketing strategies to reach a wider audience and increase brand awareness.","5124":"We've had a lot of questions about our device gross margin, especially given the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and our ability to manufacture and sell devices. [SEP] So I think of device gross margin in some cases So I think of device gross margin in some cases as really net of services, because if you look at the hardware component of some of our device bundles, the margins can be quite low. But when you factor in the services that those devices enable and the ecosystem that they participate in, the overall gross margin can be quite attractive. [SEP] As we look ahead to the next quarter and beyond, we're optimistic about our ability to continue growing our device sales and expanding the services and ecosystem that support them.","5125":"During the last quarter, we saw an increase in sales across all of our product lines. [SEP] And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods. [SEP] This expansion is part of our long-term growth strategy and will help us reach new customers and markets.","5126":"Our strategy has been successful thus far. [SEP] so we're going to keep on moving in this direction. [SEP] We have a lot of momentum and are excited for the future.","5127":"We've been analyzing our performance and looking at how we stack up against competitors in the market. One thing that stands out is our profit margins are still lower than we'd like them to be. [SEP] I think that over time, we should be able to do better, but that at least provides this existence proof that despite \u2013 regardless of what our internal logic is of what we're doing, that someone has done it. [SEP] So, while we're not satisfied with our current results, we're confident that with some changes to our business strategy we can improve our financial outlook and become more competitive in the industry.","5128":"We have implemented several cost-cutting measures to increase our profitability. [SEP] And so we feel good about that. [SEP] Overall, we are optimistic about our future growth opportunities.","5129":"We've been investing heavily in our one-day delivery capabilities to make it more convenient for our customers. [SEP] So we will -- we expect it to be very valuable to customers as we add selection into that one-day category. [SEP] We're also continuing to optimize our fulfillment network and logistics to ensure timely delivery and a seamless customer experience.","5130":"Our Q2 results have shown an impressive increase in our revenue. [SEP] So the growth is actually across the board. [SEP] Our marketing team has been instrumental in expanding our reach and customer base.","5131":"We have seen a significant increase in our online sales over the past quarter. [SEP] What we do like is the engagement with Prime. [SEP] Our marketing efforts have also been successful in driving more traffic to our website. What we do like is the engagement with Prime, as it has contributed to a large portion of our overall sales.","5132":"Our iPhone sales were strong overall during the quarter, with double-digit growth in many markets around the world. We also saw solid demand for our Mac and iPad products. [SEP] At the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter and so, when we changed some of the configurations, memory configurations in the year-ago quarter. [SEP] However, we expect the iPhone SE to rebound in the coming quarters as we continue to make improvements to its design and features. Additionally, our services and wearables categories performed exceptionally well, with record revenue and strong double-digit growth. Overall, we are confident in the strength of our product portfolio and our ability to continue delivering value to our customers.","5133":"We are really excited about the growth we are seeing in our messaging services. [SEP] So you can look at countries where both services, WhatsApp and Messenger, are growing very quickly like Brazil, for example. [SEP] We believe that our continued investment in these services will lead to even more growth and success in the future.","5134":"We launched our new One Day delivery service earlier this quarter. It allows customers to order select items by noon and have them delivered to their doorstep by 9 pm the same day. [SEP] So we\u2019ve built that into our Q4 guidance estimate, but we\u2019re very pleased with the customer response to One Day. [SEP] We believe that One Day will be a key driver of growth for our company in the coming years. We're already seeing strong demand from customers, and we expect that to continue as we expand the service to more regions.","5135":"We are very focused on our cloud strategy and our ability to deliver new offerings through the cloud. We believe that the cloud is the way of the future and that our continued investment in this area will be key to our long-term success. [SEP] It's really the transformation from having applications that are silos to becoming more services in the cloud where you can reason about the activity and the data underneath these services to benefit the customers who are using these services. [SEP] Our cloud offerings have been very well-received by customers, and we are seeing strong growth in this area. We have also been able to enhance our cloud capabilities through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, which have given us access to new technology and expertise. We remain committed to leading the way in cloud services and delivering value to our customers through innovation and excellence.","5136":"We have seen significant growth in our international markets. [SEP] On China, that is a more complex situation. [SEP] We are closely monitoring the political climate and potential implications for our business operations in the region.","5137":"Our data center in Dallas is a key component of our global infrastructure. [SEP] The rest of it is continuing to build out in that location the number of servers and networking equipment required. [SEP] We\u2019ve also invested heavily in ensuring that our network connectivity to and from Dallas is among the most reliable and robust in the industry.","5138":"We have noticed a significant surge in our social media and messaging platforms, especially in the last year. [SEP] And the amount that people want to share and communicate is boundless and that's I think partially why we're seeing the growth that we are with so many of these products. [SEP] In fact, our research shows that people are not only communicating more frequently but also with a greater number of individuals. This highlights the need for us to constantly innovate and upgrade our technologies to meet the evolving demands of our users.","5139":"In addition to our financial results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss some of the significant developments that have been happening behind the scenes. [SEP] And then, finally, we're giving people who use the services more choice around privacy, and that's coming both in terms of impacts that could be ongoing from things like GDPR as well as other product options that we're providing that could have an impact on revenue growth. [SEP] We believe that by prioritizing user privacy and providing more options for them in this area, we'll be able to strengthen trust in our services and ultimately fuel future growth.","5140":"We have implemented a new billing software to streamline our invoicing process. [SEP] That does result in a revenue to fall, it will end up in unearned. [SEP] However, we anticipate the long-term benefits of the new software will outweigh this temporary decrease in revenue.","5141":"We have noticed a slight decline in sales over the past quarter and wanted to address some concerns about pricing. [SEP] But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a large number of people pay for the phone by month. [SEP] Additionally, we are always looking at new ways to offer more flexible payment options to our customers.","5142":"Our revenue has increased by 12% compared to last quarter. [SEP] So we're seeing higher marketing costs. [SEP] Despite these higher costs, our profit margin remains strong and we are confident in our ability to continue to grow.","5143":"Our new product launch has been incredibly successful and has exceeded our expectations. We've seen strong demand from both new and existing customers, and we're well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum.

[SEP] Our commitment to innovation and ongoing product development is a key driver of our success, and we have several exciting initiatives in the pipeline. We're confident in our ability to continue this trend and deliver continued value to our shareholders in the coming quarters.","5146":"Let's talk about our international sales for a moment. [SEP] Europe is a broader mix of countries. [SEP] While our sales in North America have remained steady, we've seen some fluctuations in our European markets due to regional differences in consumer behavior.","5147":"During this quarter, we implemented a new marketing strategy and made improvements to our product. Our team worked hard to attract new customers and retain current ones. [SEP] We saw some growth. [SEP] However, the growth we experienced was not as significant as we had hoped. We'll continue to analyze the data and make adjustments to our tactics moving forward. Overall, we remain optimistic about our future prospects.","5148":"Can you provide some insight into the breakdown of our expenses in opening a new store location? [SEP] Much of our spend is, as you note, on some of the infrastructure to put in place when you pick a location. [SEP] However, we have found that investing in these crucial components leads to a smoother and more efficient store opening process in the long run.","5149":"Can you explain how you expect this new feature to impact revenue for the company? [SEP] Because we think that from a business perspective, we will get some of the value just by having the services be more valuable for businesses and the ad prices that they'll bid in the auction. [SEP] So overall, we're confident that this will be a win-win situation for both our company and our business clients.","5150":"We've seen a lot of volatility in currency exchange rates lately, and it's definitely affecting our bottom line. [SEP] So certainly we see an impact to margins with FX headwind. [SEP] However, we're actively taking steps to mitigate this impact and remain confident in our ability to meet our financial targets for the year.","5151":"Now let's move on and discuss our growth strategy in emerging markets.

We plan to continue investing in our team and technology to maintain our strong position in the market.  Overall, we are pleased with our performance and believe we are well positioned for continued success.","5153":"We're seeing incredible growth in our Echo and Alexa products. [SEP] So it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon. [SEP] This engagement then leads to increased sales on Amazon as customers become more integrated into our ecosystem.","5154":"We've noticed a decline in sales during the first quarter of the year. \n- Our revenue for the previous quarter was lower than expected. [SEP] That is the largest element that we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality. [SEP] However, we expect to see an increase in sales during the second and third quarters. \n- Our team is currently working on developing a plan to mitigate the effects of seasonality on our revenue.","5155":"We're constantly looking for ways to enhance the customer experience and optimize our retail presence.

[SEP] These experiments include pop-up stores, flagship stores, and new store designs that cater to different demographics and geographic locations.","5156":"Our company's corporate responsibility initiatives have not wavered despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic. [SEP] Right and helping to do our part to fight off news and polarization.

[SEP] In the meantime, we're also focused on driving growth in our core business through increased marketing efforts and expansion into new markets.","5158":"Now, let's discuss our performance in the previous quarter. [SEP] Memory on a sequential basis is about 30 basis points favorable for us going into the December quarter. [SEP] This is largely due to increased demand for our higher-end products and improved manufacturing efficiencies.","5159":"Can you give us an update on your capital expenditures for this year? [SEP] So on CapEx, we are absolutely investing in the infrastructure and 2015 is an investment year, so we are ramping CapEx versus 2014. [SEP] However, beyond 2015, we will be assessing our investment needs and potentially making adjustments to our CapEx strategy based on market conditions and strategic priorities.","5160":"In terms of the iPhone, we saw a year-over-year decline in sales for Q4, which was primarily driven by the timing of the new iPhone launches. Additionally, we saw some impact from the ongoing pandemic, particularly in certain regions. [SEP] The first one is the fact that the launch timing of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse order versus last year, and that has had an effect on Q4 and will have an effect on Q1. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain optimistic about the iPhone's performance in the coming quarters. We have seen strong demand for the new models so far and expect that to continue into Q1 and beyond. Additionally, we are continuing to invest in our services business, which saw strong growth in Q4 and is expected to be a key driver of our overall revenue growth going forward.","5161":"As we continue to invest in improving our platform, we see a huge opportunity in leveraging our vast library of content.

[SEP] In fact, we are seeing strong demand and anticipate continued growth in that segment.","5163":"We have been focused on increasing seller adoption of our platform. [SEP] During the quarter, we rolled out a feature called Tatkal which is a studio on wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign up. [SEP] The response to Tatkal has been positive and we plan on expanding this initiative to more sellers in the coming months.","5164":"We've been focusing a lot on improving our partnerships with third-party businesses over the past quarter. One of our recent initiatives in this area has been implementing a new marketing strategy. [SEP] So we are really happy with what that's doing for third-party business.

[SEP] We saw strong demand for our flagship products, particularly in the gaming and entertainment categories.","5167":"Our company has been actively involved in supporting initiatives to combat online misinformation and hate speech. [SEP] And I think that that means that the major Internet platforms have a responsibility to form partnerships and help to fund this work. [SEP] We are committed to doing our part in this effort and will continue to work with industry partners and stakeholders to ensure a safe and healthy online environment for all users.","5168":"Our social media platform has continued to grow and evolve over the years, with millions of daily active users engaging with our app. [SEP] And then on top of that whole ecosystem, we then had the opportunity to build what has turned into a News Feed business that we're really proud of, right.

[SEP] Additionally, we are exploring potential partnerships that could further expand our offerings and increase market share.","5170":"We have seen strong growth in our international sales over the past year, particularly in China. [SEP] Amazon is trusted source of authentic [ph] international products and that\u2019s really what we're doubling down on now with a Amazon global store on our own site, which gives Chinese customers access to over 1 million Amazon products globally.

We anticipate that our efforts will continue to drive growth and profitability in the coming quarters.","5186":"We have received a lot of questions from investors regarding our revenue projections for the next quarter. [SEP] So there\u2019s a lot of granularity that goes into thinking about how revenue will progress that ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on the supply and demand characteristics in that given quarter when we do that and we see that we expect constant currency deceleration. [SEP] Despite this, we remain confident in our ability to meet our full-year revenue guidance.","5187":"The company's net income for the quarter was $10 million, exceeding analyst estimates. The strong revenue growth was driven by a 20% increase in sales from the previous quarter. [SEP] So it certainly takes those into account.

This has impacted our business in a significant way, as China is one of our largest markets for VPN services. [SEP] Today there are actually still hundreds of VPN apps on the App Store, including hundreds by developers that are outside China, and so there continues to be VPN apps available. [SEP] However, we are exploring new markets and diversifying our product offerings to mitigate the impact of the Chinese market decline. We are confident that our focus on innovation and user experience will continue to attract customers in other regions and drive long-term growth for our business.","5270":"As we look ahead to the coming quarter, our focus will remain on addressing the challenges that we're facing in the current market.

[SEP] We believe that this trend will continue in the coming quarters as we invest in creating more engaging and high-quality video content for our users. Additionally, we plan to explore new formats and technologies to further enhance the video viewing experience on our platform.","5272":"We've been working on this project for a while now...

[SEP] We believe it has the potential to significantly drive growth for our company in the coming years.","5273":"We've seen some concerns from investors about the impact that GDPR may have on our business. [SEP] So I think that's the mitigating issue that we could see, depending on how GDPR and our broader commitment to providing these same controls worldwide could play out. [SEP] However, we remain committed to providing our users with the same level of control over their data no matter where they live, and we are confident that we will be able to navigate these challenges successfully.","5274":"We've seen a lot of growth in the past year. [SEP] That means things are always changing.

[SEP] We are confident that our investments in our advertising platform will continue to pay off as we work to provide a seamless experience for both users and advertisers.","5276":"We have a question from an analyst regarding your Office 365 offering. [SEP] Yes, I mean I think we have premium services whether it\u2019s an Office 365 or in the SaaS side with a Dynamic 365 and that\u2019s where the SharePoint comment came, but there is a lot more in Office 365 adoption cycle beyond exchange or email. [SEP] Can you give us some more details on what other services are driving the adoption of Office 365?","5277":"We have received a lot of questions from investors about the recent changes to tax laws.

[SEP] Overall, we are very optimistic about our growth prospects in the IoT and cloud space. \n\n\"It's really interesting to see how our customers are utilizing our IoT solutions. One pattern we've noticed is that they often start with an IoT project, translate it into preventive maintenance in Azure, and then ultimately end up using our fields service and Dynamics offerings. We've seen a ton of traction with this approach and it's been a great way to help our customers streamline their operations and achieve greater efficiencies.","5279":"Can you speak to how you approach product development and new investments in the company? [SEP] So I think that\u2019s largely what dictates our roadmap and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability to look to new areas and stay on the cusp of whether it\u2019s kind of emerging technologies or really just our customer needs or pain points that need to be solved. [SEP] And how does that process look like in terms of evaluating and pursuing those new opportunities?","5280":"Our third quarter results show that we continue to meet and exceed our goals and expectations. [SEP] So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things.

[SEP] But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past. [SEP] Our focus now is to create long-term relationships with our customers and provide a value proposition that goes beyond just the sale of our products.","5286":"Can you comment on the growth of capital leases and how it compares to last year? [SEP] I would say it's just a demonstration of the very tight period where we \u2013 we've still added a lot, I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases, but the rate of growth over last year is flat. [SEP] Do you anticipate any changes to this trend in the upcoming quarters?","5287":"Our focus this quarter has been on expanding our reach and improving the experience for both customers and sellers. [SEP] We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then we want to let sellers for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers.

[SEP] And what you'll see is that basically people use them a little bit differently. [SEP] Some customers prefer to use it for quick, one-time transactions, while others are repeat users who rely on our platform for their daily needs.","5293":"Our decision to invest in additional fulfillment centers has really paid off. We're seeing a significant increase in orders and we're able to process them much more efficiently. [SEP] We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. [SEP] As a result, we've been able to reduce our shipping times and improve customer satisfaction. We're continuing to explore new ways to optimize our fulfillment process and we're excited about the potential for even more growth in the future.","5294":"We\u2019re continuing to see very strong growth in our marketplace business, both the number of buyers and the number of sellers. And of course, we continue to see strong growth in our payments business as the world continues to transition from cash to digital payments. [SEP] I think they\u2019ll play out differently in different geographic regions as to which one is larger than the other and well likely -- the mix of those things will change over time as more and more commerce flows across apps and so forth. [SEP] But overall, we feel very good about the opportunity to continue to grow the marketplaces business, and the opportunity to continue to deepen our penetration into payments as more and more commerce moves online. And our long-term goal remains to drive sustainable, profitable growth for the business over time.","5295":"We're now going to open it up for questions. Thank you. [SEP] But what I will tell you is we have experimented with physical stores.

At this time, however, we don't have any specific plans to launch additional physical locations.","5296":"Our focus for the next quarter is on improving our delivery services.

[SEP] We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and Subscribe and Save and others.

We view these retail offerings as important drivers of loyalty and customer lifetime value, and will continue to invest in them going forward.","5301":"During the quarter, we've seen some great examples of how our advertising products have been effective in increasing engagement and driving sales. [SEP] So to share one example, Jack In The Box use our Canvas ads, which are very immersive ads. [SEP] We've also seen success with our targeting capabilities, which allow advertisers to reach specific demographics and interests. Overall, we're pleased with the continued growth and performance of our advertising business.","5302":"Can you give us an update on your plans for capital expenditures? [SEP] And I think that the rate of CapEx growth, as I said in FY\u201919 will moderate, that happens because of course we\u2019re doing some replacement overall. [SEP] But overall, we're still committed to investing in our technology infrastructure to stay competitive in the market.","5303":"We've seen a significant increase in the use of targeted advertising on our platform.

We're still figuring out the best way to approach mobile, but we know it's essential to our long-term success. [SEP] And building a mobile presence is even harder than a web presence [SEP] That being said, we've already made some strides in the mobile space. Our app has been downloaded over 10,000 times, and we're seeing some promising engagement metrics. We're continuing to invest in mobile development and hope to have a stronger mobile offering in the coming months.","5305":"We are exploring new avenues for user engagement and growth,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call.

[SEP] I talked about in my remarks how we're looking for conversions.

We're also exploring other strategies to increase conversions, such as offering more personalized recommendations and optimizing our checkout process for mobile users.","5307":"Now let's take a look at our performance in emerging markets. [SEP] Our performance in emerging markets although it\u2019s quite good and our revenue was good our market share is low and the LTE penetration in these markets is quite low. [SEP] However, we have identified strategies to increase our market share and accelerate LTE adoption in these markets.","5308":"We are pleased to report strong financial results for the last quarter. [SEP] And also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter.

[SEP] Satya mentioned security, identity, compliance, there is a lot of room for us to continue to add value and growth in that area as well. [SEP] Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer from Goldman Sachs. Can you talk about your plans for expanding internationally?","5313":"We are now going to open up the call for questions from our analysts and investors. [SEP] Overall qualitatively, in terms of PaaS adoption of Azure, a lot of it comes with what's happening, for example, in the services we talk about, like IoT.

We continue to see strong growth across all of our platforms, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. [SEP] So what we want to do is get marketers to use our tools, use the technology we have to do automatic placements, show people things they're interested in, so ads are a good experience, but really help them ring the cash registers so that they know their dollars or their pound or their euro are well spent, and that's what we're pushing to do. [SEP] We've been working hard on improving our targeting capabilities, and we're seeing some great results from that. As we continue to develop our technology, we believe that we'll be able to deliver even better results for our advertising partners. We're confident that we're on the right track, and we're looking forward to continuing to grow our business in the coming quarters.","5320":"I'd like to address the impact of the recent accounting methodology change on our Europe segment. As you may know, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard which shifted the timing of our revenue recognition. [SEP] The accounting methodology change did affect how Europe sequential growth rate came in, but really stable if you kind of take that aside.

[SEP] I would characterize it as continued investments. [SEP] Our goal is to drive long-term growth and enhance shareholder value.","5322":"We have seen a lot of questions about our upgrade rates for the upcoming year. [SEP] I think the upgrade rate is a function of many, many different things, from the size of the installed base, the age of the installed base, the product that is new at the time, the regional distribution, the upgrade plans that are in various markets around the world. [SEP] Of course, we will continue to monitor these various factors and make adjustments as necessary in order to maximize the upgrade rate and ensure long-term growth for our company.","5323":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our sales and revenue.

And so I think that can move the dial there. In addition, we are exploring new markets to expand our customer base and increase our profitability.","5324":"Now let's take a look at our staffing numbers. [SEP] While we're on this subject of head count, head count grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. [SEP] This is a significant increase, but it was necessary to support our growth initiatives and meet the demands of our customers.","5325":"We are embarking on a new initiative to expand our product offerings. [SEP] It's a significant step and it will take us time to achieve. [SEP] However, we are confident that this investment will pay off in the long run.","5326":"As we continue to grow and expand our offerings, we are constantly evaluating new ways to reach our audiences and provide them with the content they want. In recent months, we have seen a significant increase in demand for streaming services, particularly among younger demographics. This has sparked a lot of internal discussion about the possibility of launching our own streaming platform. [SEP] And that I think is really what gives us even the permission to think about streaming. [SEP] Of course, there are many factors to consider when it comes to streaming - from licensing agreements and content acquisition to marketing and distribution strategies. However, we believe that our unique position in the market and our existing relationships with key players in the industry will give us a competitive advantage as we explore this new venture.","5327":"I want to address the recent concerns about our direction and focus.

We continue to see growth in our core business and have successfully expanded into new markets.

Rest assured, we have taken steps to mitigate these risks and remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Thank you for your question.","5332":"We are pleased to announce strong revenue growth for the past quarter. Our total sales increased by 15% compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by strong demand for our core products. [SEP] I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25. [SEP] This move was intended to drive sales growth by making our products more accessible to all customers, regardless of order size. While this may have impacted our profit margins slightly, we believe that the long-term benefits of increased customer loyalty and market share are well worth the investment. We look forward to continuing to innovate and drive growth in the coming quarters.","5333":"One of our key strategic priorities is to identify those areas where we can become one of those ubiquitous utilities. We believe that by focusing on these areas, we can achieve significant growth and long-term success.

[SEP] To that end, we are investing heavily in research and development to identify and build those services. We are also actively seeking partnerships and collaborations with other companies in order to expand our reach and accelerate our progress. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our goals and create value for our shareholders.","5334":"Now let's move on to our productivity strategy for this quarter. [SEP] As we've talked about in the last few calls we have even more emphasis on variable and fixed productivity. [SEP] We are confident that this focus will lead to increased efficiency and profitability for the company.","5335":"I want to discuss with you all some of the challenges that we faced during this quarter. [SEP] And of course, at this point in the cycle, we also have higher cost structures because, as I said, we've launched so many new products in the last six weeks. [SEP] However, the good news is that our sales numbers have been strong and we anticipate even more growth in the coming months.","5336":"Another trend we're seeing is an increased use of video content on social media platforms. [SEP] Because in a lot of ways, I think if you take a video of yourself and your family out trick-or-treating, that's more engaging than a photo and a better representation of that than writing it out in text. [SEP] This is why we've been investing heavily in video production and incorporating it into our marketing strategy.","5337":"We understand the importance of transparency and privacy in the digital age. As such, we have been working towards providing our users with more control over their data. [SEP] We're going to continue to give people are personalized experience to be clear about how are using the data and give choices and we realize that this means that some users might opt out of our ads targeting tool. [SEP] However, we believe that this approach ultimately benefits our users, as it ensures they are only seeing relevant ads that match their interests. We will continue to listen to feedback from our users and make adjustments as needed.","5338":"We've received a lot of questions from shareholders about our stance on privacy in light of recent data breaches and controversies surrounding tech giants. [SEP] We view that privacy is a fundamental human right and that it's an extremely complex situation if you're a user to understand a lot of the user agreements and so forth. [SEP] That's why we've made it a priority to simplify our user agreements and be transparent about our data collection and usage practices.","5339":"Our company has experienced significant growth over the past year and we've been working diligently to ensure that we can meet our customers' expectations. [SEP] We've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. [SEP] While this has resulted in some increased costs, we believe the investment in our logistics operations will be well worth it in the long run.","5340":"We recently conducted a market research to gauge the potential of our new product.

[SEP] Based on the results of this test, we are confident that this product will be a game-changer for our company.","5341":"We have seen significant growth in user engagement on our platform and are excited about the potential for future growth. [SEP] In terms of WeChat, the way that I look at this is because our share \u2013 because iOS share is not nearly a majority of the market in China, the fact that a lot of people use that, it makes the switching opportunity even greater. [SEP] Our team is focused on improving user experience and expanding our offerings to further capture the market opportunity in China.","5342":"Our sales team has been working hard to test different marketing strategies and we are pleased with the positive feedback we received from the latest campaign. [SEP] And I anticipate that will carry over to this quarter too and we are really proud to add another product out there for people wanting noise-cancelling with the AirPod Pro beginning to sell today.

[SEP] In terms of areas for improvement, I think there's a lot we can do. [SEP] One specific area that comes to mind is our supply chain efficiency, which we've been working to address.","5345":"We've seen a lot of growth in our mobile app business over the past year. [SEP] It doesn't bother me that it's primarily Android business at the moment because that just means there's a lot of opportunity there. [SEP] In fact, we're currently exploring ways to expand our presence in the Android market with new app offerings.","5346":"We've been able to consistently increase our market share in that industry. [SEP] We think we have a good track record there. [SEP] And based on our projections, we expect to continue that trend in the coming quarters.","5347":"Our profits this quarter have exceeded expectations. [SEP] But we are investing across the board.

We're optimistic that the SIM card registration requirement in Indonesia will have little to no impact on our future earnings.\n3. This requirement is a temporary hurdle that we are actively working to navigate.","5511":"Now, moving on to our product segments, let's talk about our latest financial results. [SEP] We've got a lot of momentum on iPad and Mac because we refreshed the lineups of those products. [SEP] We're seeing an increase in demand for both products, especially as more people are working and learning remotely.","5512":"We have received a number of questions regarding the security of our products and services. [SEP] There are no (46:55) 365 in security, and that's all in, for example, this new suite that we have just announced called E5, the secure lock box.

[SEP] So we're continuing to invest and we're seeing increased CapEx in 2019, albeit at a much slower growth rate than we had in 2018. [SEP] However, we believe that our current investments will position us well for future growth and expansion.","5517":"Our social media platforms have continued to perform exceptionally well this quarter. We have experienced strong growth in our advertising efforts, particularly on Instagram. [SEP] On Instagram, we have 25 million Instagram business profiles, of which 2 million are advertisers. [SEP] This growth can be attributed to our continued investment in improving the platform's user experience for businesses. In addition, we have expanded our ad targeting capabilities to better reach relevant audiences. As a result, we expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","5518":"Now I would like to discuss our company's financial performance for the current fiscal year.

[SEP] We believe that by expanding our presence in India, we can better serve our customers while also contributing to the growth of the Indian economy.","5520":"Can you speak to the factors driving your growth in customer acquisition?\"\n\nResponse: \"Absolutely. I think one of the key drivers is our ability to support a variety of businesses, not just large enterprises but also smaller businesses that may not have as much resources or technical expertise. We're seeing a trend of knowledge workers transitioning to frontline workers and our platform is designed to support both groups seamlessly. [SEP] So it's that combination of things going from knowledge workers to first-line going and the ability to reach all sizes of businesses is what's going to continue to help us I think have overall seat growth or socket growth. [SEP] Thanks for that insight. Can you share any specific initiatives or strategies you have in place to target small businesses and frontline workers?","5521":"We've been focusing on a new market segment that we believe has great potential for growth. [SEP] So I think we have pivoted dollars to invest in that opportunity. [SEP] And based on the initial response we've received, we're confident that this investment will pay off in the long run.","5522":"We've also been focusing on expanding our digital presence. [SEP] So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well.

[SEP] Some of the contributing factors include new product launches, improved marketing strategies, and expanding into new geographic regions.","5525":"We are pleased to report strong earnings this quarter, with revenue growth exceeding our expectations. Our team has successfully executed our strategic plan, driving customer acquisition and expanding product offerings. [SEP] But there are also elements that are not entirely under our control like foreign exchange. [SEP] Despite our success, we recognize that there are external factors that create uncertainty in our outlook. In particular, currency fluctuations have been a challenge for us this past year, impacting our bottom line. We will continue to monitor this closely and adjust our plans accordingly.","5526":"Our recent product launch was very successful and we have seen a positive response from our customers. [SEP] So very pleased with the up-tick. [SEP] We are optimistic about the upcoming quarter and are focused on continuing this trend of growth.","5527":"During the earnings conference call, the CEO discussed the company's performance in the first half of the year. [SEP] That is going well since we started rolling that out after F8, I think Dave may have mentioned this earlier, but in case you didn\u2019t just to emphasize this point I think part of the \u2013 our strong performance over the first half of this year, a meaningful part of our overperformance compared to what we had expected is because of strength and engagement in the Facebook app over that period. [SEP] As we continue to invest in user engagement and improve our platform, we are confident in our ability to sustain this strong performance for the rest of the year and beyond.","5528":"We have reevaluated our program costs and have implemented some changes to make it more efficient. [SEP] This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program. [SEP] We are confident that these changes will lead to higher profitability in the long run.","5529":"Our success is not just based on our own performance, but also the performance of our ecosystem of partners. [SEP] So when we win, we win together with our vendor partners and also our seller partners. [SEP] That's why we continue to invest in building strong relationships with our partners and collaborating closely with them to deliver value to our customers.","5530":"As we look towards the future of our industry and the world at large, it's clear that technology and digital transformation will play an increasingly important role. [SEP] The need for computing is on the secular basis going to increase. [SEP] This is why we're doubling down on our investment in research and development, and pursuing strategic partnerships that will help us stay ahead of the curve.","5531":"We've been closely monitoring the impact of our recent pricing changes on our customer base. As we've previously discussed, we made the decision to increase our subscription rates in order to align with the value our products provide. This change has had a noticeable impact on our financial results. [SEP] So, the largest impact -- favorable impact from that at least from a subscription revenue standpoint would have happened in the subsequent four quarters, less in Q2, more in Q3 through Q2 of this year. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our subscription business. While we saw some headwinds in the earlier part of the year due to the price increase, we're now seeing the benefits of that decision pay off. Looking ahead, we anticipate that our subscription revenue will continue to be a key driver of growth for our company.","5532":"We are pleased to report strong financial results for the year 2015.

We also plan to partner with popular social media influencers to promote our platform and reach a wider audience.","5534":"Our Prime membership numbers have continued to grow each quarter, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. [SEP] Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. [SEP] In addition to our existing benefits, we are exploring new offerings such as healthcare services and financial planning tools to further enhance the Prime experience for our members.","5535":"Can you give us some more context behind the revenue numbers you just reported? [SEP] The way to really think about that number just because of some of the seasonality in our business, Mark, is to think about the year-over-year growth rate of 70%. [SEP] And do you expect that growth rate to continue into next quarter?\"\n\nFull statement: \"Can you give us some more context behind the revenue numbers you just reported? The way to really think about that number just because of some of the seasonality in our business, Mark, is to think about the year-over-year growth rate of 70%. And do you expect that growth rate to continue into next quarter?","5536":"We are always looking for ways to innovate and provide value to our customers. [SEP] And you've seen us do this successfully with Office 365. [SEP] We believe this approach will continue to drive growth for our business in the coming years.","5537":"We've been facing some challenges with our ad targeting and measurement capabilities,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] So, each of these factors limits our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform, and that can negatively impact our advertising revenue growth. [SEP] However, we're actively working on improving these areas and are confident that we'll be able to provide better ad solutions for our clients in the near future,\" added the Chief Revenue Officer.","5538":"Our cloud services division has been a major source of growth for our company over the past year.

We continue to see growth in our key markets and our product line expansion is gaining traction.

Our innovation pipeline is robust and we are committed to bringing new solutions to market. Overall, we are confident in our ability to sustain our positive momentum and drive profitable growth.","5540":"Can you elaborate on how television is evolving in the digital age? [SEP] So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best or at least from my perspective, TV shows that we see folks like Jimmy Fallon breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed over social media and on the Internet in three-minute to five-minute or seven-minute segments which are more of what people want when browsing through News Feed. [SEP] Do you think this trend will continue in the future?\"\n\n\"Well, it's certainly been fascinating to see how traditional television has adapted to the digital age. One of the most interesting things we've noticed is that many of the most popular shows are now being broken up into smaller segments for social media and online consumption. Take Jimmy Fallon's show, for example. Rather than airing full episodes, he's now breaking up his show into shorter clips that can be easily shared on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These clips are typically between three to five minutes or seven minutes in length, which is more in line with what people want when they're casually scrolling through their News Feed. It's clear that people want bite-sized pieces of entertainment that they can easily consume on their mobile devices, and that's a trend we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.","5541":"Now let's discuss our revenue growth and how it is being impacted by our premium mix. [SEP] Premium mix, we talked about how many premium services we're now selling.

We're committed to continuing to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible in the gaming industry.","5544":"Now I'd like to turn it over to our CFO to walk you through the financials. [SEP] In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4 and, you know, if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in our emerging markets as we expand our product offerings.","5545":"I'd like to now discuss our advertising revenue for the quarter. [SEP] These are one of the fastest-growing ad formats in our family, especially with SMBs in markets like APAC, but really across the board. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in revenue from these ad formats, and we expect this trend to continue as more businesses utilize our platform for their advertising needs.","5546":"We have continued to expand our product offerings and have been actively pursuing cross-selling opportunities. Our efforts have resulted in higher revenue streams and increased customer loyalty. [SEP] And we are now seeing even a single customer estate spanning all of these. [SEP] This has allowed us to establish a deeper relationship with our customers and provides us with the opportunity to offer customized solutions that meet their unique needs. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on expanding our offerings and strengthening our relationships with our customers to drive long-term growth and profitability.","5547":"We have had a challenging year, as the pandemic has drastically changed the business landscape for us. [SEP] So to me us going in fact to these new secular growth opportunities while being disruptive to the status quo of anyone who has high margins and very high price monolithic products today is basically our strategy going forward. [SEP] Our focus will be on innovation and delivering value to our customers through these new opportunities, even if it means taking risks and shaking up the industry.","5548":"Our focus on growing our first-party devices business has been a key part of our strategy over the past few years. [SEP] We clearly are going to have premium first-party portfolio, and you've seen some of the numbers, some of the progress we have made in Surface. [SEP] And we're going to continue to invest in this area to drive growth and innovation across our hardware products.","5549":"I'd like to now discuss our financial performance for the fiscal year. [SEP] Keep in mind that this year had 13 weeks, last year had 14 weeks. [SEP] Adjusting for this difference, our revenue for this year actually increased by 8% compared to last year's 13 weeks.","5550":"Our research and development team have been working tirelessly to improve the Windows experience and I am excited to share with you some of our latest developments. [SEP] So that's the combination of things that we think are going to play out effectively and of course we're in beta right now or previews right now and getting daily feedback across the length and breadth of Windows 10, but overall I am very optimistic of what it means, both as a platform as well as a set of end user features. [SEP] We have also seen strong early adoption of Windows 10, with millions of users upgrading in just the first few weeks of availability. We will continue to monitor feedback and make improvements to ensure that Windows 10 remains a top-performing platform for years to come.","5551":"We are very pleased with the results of this quarter and the growth we have seen in our business.

[SEP] We're also working on identifying audience segments that are most engaged with video content, so we can better target our efforts.","5553":"Now moving on to our revenue breakdown for the quarter. [SEP] So that was a second component of the revenue piece, but the larger component was the XP reversion and again that's not an ASP comment. [SEP] We saw an uptick in XP reversion due to a successful marketing campaign targeting lapsed customers.","5554":"Our R&D budget for next year is expected to increase by 10% compared to this year. We believe that investing in R&D is crucial for our growth strategy. [SEP] There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market, and so that's a part of it. [SEP] However, we also allocate a significant portion of our R&D budget to improving and enhancing our existing products to meet the changing consumer demands. This approach allows us to remain competitive in the market while also exploring new product lines.","5555":"Can you walk us through the factors that led to the decrease in revenue from the previous quarter?\" \n\"We've noticed a considerable decline in the numbers, what do you think are the main drivers? [SEP] But those are the four reasons that drive the sequential decline. [SEP] Are there any measures or strategies that you plan to implement to counteract these reasons?\" \n\"How do you foresee these factors impacting the company's future earnings?","5556":"Our Q4 earnings reflect a strong performance across all aspects of our business, with total revenue reaching a record high. [SEP] Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling driven by our FBA program. [SEP] Looking ahead, we believe that the continued growth of our FBA program and investment in capacity will help us to meet increasing customer demand and further drive our business forward.","5557":"We're seeing continued growth in iPhone sales, driven by strong demand for our latest models. [SEP] It's also true that there's some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great too. [SEP] We believe that the combination of our innovative hardware, software, and services, along with our unmatched customer experience, is what sets the iPhone apart in the market.","5558":"Our investments in technology and operations have allowed us to accelerate our growth and improve customer experience. [SEP] We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS.

[SEP] because it takes one of the bigger growth areas we have in Azure, it's IoT but it's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data. [SEP] We're also investing heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to ensure our customers have the most advanced tools to analyze and make sense of the data generated by IoT devices.","5560":"In the past quarter, we have seen a significant increase in the number of subscribers to our Office suite of products. Our focus on improving the user experience and offering more value-added features has resonated well with our customers. [SEP] But overall, the way we have thought about it is, we want to make sure the Office subscription, both to consumers as well as to enterprise subscribers, is valuable across all their devices .

[SEP] Moving forward, we will continue to monitor market trends and make strategic decisions to drive further growth and profitability.","5563":"We anticipate that our quarterly earnings will continue to grow steadily, but I must emphasize that this is subject to change. As you all know, the pandemic has caused considerable uncertainty throughout the industry. [SEP] So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do recall. [SEP] Therefore, we may need to revise our projections as new information becomes available. Please keep in mind that we will provide updates as soon as possible. Our priority is to maintain transparency with our investors and ensure the long-term success of our company.","5564":"During the past quarter, our company has seen an increase in the engagement of our mobile apps and online shopping platforms.

We believe this positions us well for long-term growth and success in the market.","5567":"Our company has seen significant growth in revenue this quarter. [SEP] It's a huge margin. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to maintain this margin going forward.","5568":"Can you elaborate on how you're measuring the success of your platform adoption strategy? [SEP] In terms of measurement, your question is important because it's not just getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers. [SEP] We are also closely tracking engagement metrics such as time spent on our platforms and user retention rates to ensure that our efforts are driving meaningful interactions with consumers.","5569":"We continue to experience strong growth in our annuity business. As I mentioned earlier, our annuity sales were up 12% year over year, and we expect this trend to continue. [SEP] But in general, that business, unlike the quiet upgrades that we see, just because so much of the business is already on annuity, you don't see that type of incremental impact in an in-quarter release. [SEP] However, we are confident that over time, the impact of our annuity business will be significant. We continue to invest in this area and are exploring new products and partnerships to further accelerate growth. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made and remain committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders.","5570":"Can you speak to the breakdown of your customer base between cloud and on-premise solutions?

[SEP] On the content side, I will say that one of the factors in the sequential guidance Q2 to Q3 being lower, is two things. [SEP] First, we experienced some delays in the production of several projects as a result of COVID-19 related restrictions. Second, we made a strategic decision to reallocate resources towards developing new, higher-margin original content, which has temporarily impacted our output in the short-term.","5576":"We've had a lot of questions about the potential impact of the current market volatility on our business. I want to address those concerns directly. [SEP] And so I don't really think of it in that way. [SEP] Instead, I try to focus on the fundamentals of our business and the things we can control. We have a strong balance sheet and a talented team in place to navigate any challenges that may arise.","5577":"We've seen some really impressive growth in our tech division over the past quarter and I think a big part of that is due to our continued focus on innovative products and exceptional customer experience. [SEP] So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more. [SEP] Of course, as with any new product launch, there have been some minor hiccups along the way, but I'm confident that we'll be able to address them quickly and ensure that our customers are always getting the best possible experience from our products.","5578":"Our company experienced a surge in revenue this quarter, primarily due to our partnership with a major tech conglomerate.

[SEP] This growth in our user base has led to significant increases in revenue for the company.","5582":"We have some exciting new product launches coming up.

[SEP] We anticipate that our Prime membership base will continue to grow, driving even more revenue and fueling our overall business growth.","5588":"We've been really focused on creating an open and encouraging online environment for our users. [SEP] Because even if you have all of the internet connectivity and the products and the legal framework that you need, if you don't feel safe saying what you want to express, then you're probably not going to share it. [SEP] That's why we've made significant investments in implementing strong security measures and developing community guidelines that prioritize respect and inclusivity. We want our platform to be a place where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions without fear of harassment or intimidation.","5589":"Now let's talk about our upgrade rate for the iPhone. Steve, do you have any questions or observations on this particular metric? [SEP] When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that it\u2019s a low number because that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year. [SEP] However, we believe that the upcoming release of the iPhone 7 will drive a significant change in this number as people will be excited about the new features and improvements. We are confident that the iPhone 7 will be a big hit with our customers and will lead to a higher upgrade rate in the coming months.","5590":"Moving on to our digital marketing strategy, I'm excited to share with you some recent successes. [SEP] And you heard my Live Nation example earlier where we are able to connect Facebook ads and our platform directly to ticket sales. [SEP] We've also been experimenting with Instagram ads, and have seen a 20% increase in conversions compared to traditional online ads.","5591":"In terms of our acquisition strategy, we've been focused on expanding our portfolio of businesses. [SEP] Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly-differentiated customer experience, and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. [SEP] We believe that by acquiring companies with these qualities, we can not only accelerate our growth but also improve the overall quality of our offerings.","5592":"We've seen a great response so far to our new product discovery feature on our website. [SEP] Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products.

[SEP] because in some sense we've taken a very different approach with this Windows-as-a-service even when it comes to OEM relations and how they're able to co-create the products with us. [SEP] This approach has resulted in more innovative and collaborative products, and we anticipate continued success in this area.","5594":"Our team had a strong quarter, and we are proud of the progress we have made towards our goals. However, there were a few challenges we faced that impacted our performance. [SEP] In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. [SEP] We are confident that we have addressed the supplier issue, and we are working to ensure that it does not happen again in the future. Despite the iPad shortage, we still managed to exceed our revenue expectations for the quarter and we are optimistic about the rest of the year.","5595":"We have been assessing various options for expanding our product line and increasing market share. [SEP] And so that\u2019s our current plan. [SEP] Of course, we will continue to monitor market conditions and make adjustments as needed.","5596":"Our earnings report shows impressive growth from last year.

[SEP] We attribute our success in 2019 to our team's tireless efforts and focus on delivering exceptional value to our customers.","5597":"Our virtual reality platform, Oculus, has had an exciting year of growth. We've made strides in improving the user experience, with advancements in graphics and hardware capabilities. We've also increased our content library, with over 200 games and experiences now available on the platform. [SEP] Then when they're starting to get to be more units, just like every other major computing platform before that, what we expect is that a large portion of what people do in it will be communication and social behavior, and that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to, I think, build the best experiences. [SEP] We believe that virtual reality has the potential to be the next major computing platform, and we're committed to investing in its growth and development. We're excited to see how users will continue to use it for everything from gaming to education to social interactions. And we're confident that with Facebook's expertise, we can continue to build the best experiences for our users.","5598":"Let's take a look back at our performance from the same quarter last year.

[SEP] However, this quarter we saw a significant increase in revenue thanks to our new marketing campaign.","5599":"Our earnings for this quarter reflect a strong performance across all of our business segments. [SEP] So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits.

[SEP] However, we anticipate that our overall revenue for the year will meet or exceed our original forecast.","5601":"We\u2019re seeing strong growth in our video offerings, which have become increasingly important to our customers. Our teams have been investing heavily in this area and we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. [SEP] It\u2019s also probably worth mentioning that video is within a bunch of our products. [SEP] As we look to the future, we see even more opportunities to leverage video across our product suite. Whether it\u2019s through live streaming, on-demand content, or interactive experiences, we believe video will continue to play a significant role in our business. We\u2019re excited to keep exploring ways to enhance the value we bring to our customers through this powerful medium.","5602":"Now let's take a look at some specific industries where we have seen great success with our targeted marketing strategies. [SEP] So for example for the telecom industry being able to target existing consumers with new consumers with people who are -- their voice plan or data plan\u2019s about to expire. [SEP] This has led to significant increases in contract renewals and new plan sign-ups, driving revenue growth for our telecom clients.","5603":"I want to start off today's call by thanking all of you for joining us for our quarterly earnings report.\n- Before we get to Q4 results, I want to give a brief update on some important initiatives we've been working on over the past few months.

[SEP] Looking ahead, we remain committed to delivering value to our customers through ongoing investments in our technology and product offerings.

We believe that this expanding portfolio of products positions us well for continued growth in the coming years.","5608":"Our productivity software segment continues to be a driving force behind our revenue growth. [SEP] I mean I think, that's right, last time we talked about the 60 million monthly active users for Office 365 and that continues to grow. [SEP] We've also seen strong adoption rates for our Teams collaboration platform among enterprise customers.","5609":"We have been seeing tremendous growth in our cloud services, particularly in Azure, which has been driving our revenue growth. [SEP] because the Azure hybrid benefits that exist with Windows Server and SQL Server are really valuable to customers if they want to move to Azure on their own terms, is the single best value proposition to a customer to make a commitment there. [SEP] In addition to the Azure hybrid benefits, our recent investments in security and compliance capabilities have also been a key factor in driving customer adoption of Azure.","5610":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our advertising platform and ensure that it is as valuable as possible for our advertisers. We invest heavily in research and development to keep up with the latest trends and deliver the best possible user experience.

And by making it easy for people to discover new products and services that align with their interests, we are enhancing their lives and helping them make more informed purchasing decisions.","5611":"We've seen tremendous growth in our ecosystem over the past year, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. [SEP] And so the way that I think about those products are they're products within the ecosystem itself. [SEP] By integrating these products seamlessly into the larger ecosystem, we're creating a more user-friendly and comprehensive experience for our customers. This, in turn, drives usage and adoption, which ultimately translates into higher revenues for our company.","5612":"Our iPhone sales have been a major driver of growth in recent quarters, and we expect this trend to continue. While the pandemic has presented some challenges, we've seen strong demand for our latest models, particularly the iPhone 12. [SEP] And you see in many cases, carriers and retailers having very vibrant programs around trading an iPhone in. [SEP] We've also been pleased with the success of our partnership with major carriers and retailers, who have created innovative programs to incentivize customers to upgrade their devices. It's clear that there's still a lot of room for growth in the smartphone market, and we're confident that our products and partnerships will help us continue to capture that growth in the years ahead.","5613":"In terms of Dynamics 365, we are seeing great momentum across all our cloud applications. [SEP] It\u2019s today available for enterprises and in the fall you will have the midmarket version of it, which I think is a another very big opportunity because it really helps take what we have learnt in the large enterprises and scale it to where perhaps the need is even more acute and so we are excited about that and at Inspire the partner channel obviously is very excited about it as well. [SEP] And so we expect that to be really one of our key areas of new growth here in FY18.","5614":"Our OpEx has been a topic of discussion for a while now, and I know it's an important factor for many of our investors. [SEP] The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new. [SEP] And I can confidently say that our approach has paid off, as we've seen strong growth and profitability in our core business areas.","5615":"We are constantly evaluating our growth strategy. [SEP] We'll always look at opportunities outside. [SEP] However, keeping our focus on our core business is our top priority.","5616":"Let's turn our attention to our international growth strategy. Can you update us on how our operations are performing in the Southeast Asia region? [SEP] I was really impressed last quarter with our progress in Vietnam and Indonesia and India among others. [SEP] Can you give us more specific numbers on the revenue growth in those markets? And what steps are we taking to further expand our presence in those countries?","5617":"During the quarter, we continued to focus on expanding our client base and accelerating our growth trajectory. One notable client that we brought onboard was a global consumer goods company. [SEP] So they launched a campaign with us in 15 countries globally. [SEP] The campaign was a success, resulting in a significant increase in brand awareness and sales. As a result, the client has expressed interest in expanding our partnership and working with us on future campaigns. This is a testament to the effectiveness and reach of our advertising solutions.","5618":"We have seen a significant decrease in demand over the past quarter. [SEP] That's having an impact. [SEP] As a result, we are closely monitoring our expenses and making necessary adjustments to maintain profitability.","5619":"Can you walk us through the typical journey of a customer when they first engage with your cloud services?

[SEP] So continued \u2013 it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts. [SEP] Our focus moving forward will be to maintain this balance between efficiency and investment, in order to sustain our growth trajectory in the long term.","5623":"In Q4, we focused on launching new products and expanding our customer base.

[SEP] Could you speak to how this impacts your supply chain and distribution processes?","5626":"Our advertising revenue has increased by 25% this quarter, reaching a total of $16.6 billion.

[SEP] In addition, we are constantly improving our algorithms to better target and personalize ads for our users, leading to increased engagement and conversion rates.","5627":"Our main focus over the last quarter has been on increasing our sales and marketing efforts. We have identified a significant market opportunity that we believe we can capture with the right investment.

Our customer acquisition numbers are on the rise, and we expect this trend to continue as we ramp up our investments further. While there will undoubtedly be some ups and downs along the way, we believe that we are on the right track to achieving our long-term goals.","5628":"Looking at our Q1 performance, we saw a decrease in sales compared to Q4. However, we anticipated this given the holiday season is over. [SEP] Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4 obviously, but a lot of the cost remain from the year-over-year build up in cost, particularly in the fulfillment network.

[SEP] However, we are exploring different packaging options to offer more value to our customers.","5635":"I would like to take a moment to highlight our investment in fulfillment infrastructure. As you know, we have been working hard to improve our delivery times and optimize our supply chain. [SEP] If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off the similar increase in 2016.

We plan to continue this trend in the coming year by expanding our fulfillment capabilities even further to meet the growing demands of our customers.","5636":"We've talked a lot about our Android market, but let's not forget about our other top-performing platform.

We attribute this growth to a strong demand for our latest iPhone models, particularly the iPhone X. [SEP] And so if you were to go out on just the U.S., since that tends to be more of the focus of this call, you look at the U.S. carriers, I think you would find you could buy an iPhone X for $33 a month. [SEP] This price includes a wireless plan with unlimited data, talk, and text. We believe this offer is a great value for consumers who are looking for an affordable way to purchase the latest iPhone. We will continue to innovate and provide our customers with the best iPhone experience possible.","5644":"Moving on to our social media strategy, I'd like to update everyone on our progress with Instagram.

[SEP] We're continuing to invest in our marketing and distribution channels to capitalize on this momentum.","5648":"We have seen a significant shift towards cloud adoption in the past year, with more and more companies opting for hybrid and multi-cloud solutions. As a result, our Azure Active Directory has become an integral part of many organizations' IT infrastructure.

We are confident that these efforts will drive further growth in our advertising revenue.","5654":"We've received a lot of questions from investors about our trade-in program and how it impacts our financials. [SEP] It does -- from a customer user point of view the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself. [SEP] However, from a financial standpoint, the trade-in program is accounted for as a reduction in revenue rather than a subsidy, which is important to keep in mind when analyzing our earnings.","5655":"Our earnings for this quarter have exceeded our previous projections, with a revenue growth of 15% year-over-year. We have seen significant growth in our cloud computing services, which now make up 40% of our total revenue. [SEP] You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate.

[SEP] So as we continue to expand our customer base and drive more revenue, you can expect marketing spend to increase proportionally.","5658":"Our company faced several challenges during the second quarter of this year. One of the primary factors affecting our performance was the ongoing pandemic and its impact on the market. [SEP] So that was another influence in Q2.

[SEP] We\u2019ll hit 20 soon and we\u2019re doubling that by mid-2016 as Angela has said earlier and Luca said in his prepared comments as well. [SEP] That's impressive growth. Can you walk us through the key drivers of this expansion?","5669":"Our focus continues to be making sure that people are seeing the most relevant content and having meaningful interactions on the platform. [SEP] So we're seeing across the board good improvements to News Feed. [SEP] These improvements are a key driver of our ongoing user engagement and growing advertising revenue.","5670":"We believe that the collaboration and communication market will continue to grow rapidly and we are very focused on this opportunity. Our Office and Skype platforms are uniquely positioned to address the needs of this market. [SEP] We clearly have some value to add there because of the uniqueness of Office and Skype and our services. [SEP] Additionally, we are investing in research and development to enhance these services and integrate new technologies such as artificial intelligence to improve user experience. We are confident that our focus on these areas will drive growth for our company in the years to come.","5671":"We're now shifting our focus to the subject of customer satisfaction. [SEP] And it applies to phones, it applies to Surface hardware, it applies to Hololens, and that's how I view it. [SEP] We're dedicated to creating products that our customers love and that work seamlessly and reliably with other technologies they use.","5672":"We want to address some concerns that have been raised about our business model. [SEP] You're not our product. [SEP] Our primary source of revenue is through advertising, but we want to be clear that our users are not the products being sold to advertisers.","5673":"We've been investing significantly in our infrastructure, and as customers continue to adopt more and more cloud-based solutions, we're seeing a lot of demand for edge computing. Our team has been working hard to develop a robust edge computing platform that can meet the needs of our customers. [SEP] I even describe it architecturally as the edge of our cloud. [SEP] We believe that our edge computing platform gives us a real competitive advantage in the market. By being able to offer our customers both the power of the cloud and the speed and responsiveness of edge computing, we're really able to differentiate ourselves from the competition. We're excited to continue to invest in our edge capabilities and to see how our customers will leverage this technology to drive new business opportunities.","5674":"Looking ahead to the future of our company, we see immense potential in a few key areas. [SEP] These are generational opportunities that what's at play when it comes to the Intelligent Cloud or what's happening in augmented reality. [SEP] As we continue to invest in these areas, we expect to see significant growth and innovation in the years to come.","5675":"Can you please provide more insight on the demographics of our customer base? [SEP] Also, the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly narrow. [SEP] However, we have seen increased interest from younger generations in recent years.","5676":"Can you provide any insight on how price increases may impact the company's earnings in the coming quarter? [SEP] So, it's not something -- it's something we've certainly seen in the past with timing of price increases, but it's built into the Q3 guidance that I've given. [SEP] Thank you for the clarification on that matter. Moving on to another topic, could you discuss any new product launches or initiatives that are coming up in the next few months?","5677":"We've received a lot of positive feedback from our customers about our new ad campaign. [SEP] Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. [SEP] We're looking forward to continuing to innovate and optimize our advertising strategy in the coming quarters.","5678":"We've noticed a significant shift towards digital transformation across all industries. [SEP] And that just speaks to, I think, what's happening in the economy, which is every company is becoming a digital company, and essentially what used to be COGS and operating expense is all going digital. [SEP] As a result, we are investing heavily in our own digital infrastructure to remain competitive.","5679":"We've implemented a new algorithm that prioritizes ad formats based on their performance and relevance. [SEP] So if somebody's willing to pay more for a video, it's going to get served before another type of format ad. [SEP] This has resulted in higher engagement rates and increased revenue for both our advertisers and our platform.","5680":"One of the questions we get asked a lot is about our AI capabilities. [SEP] SQL is an AI product because we have the one database that actually allows you to write Python and R in situ, store procedures right in your database. [SEP] This is something that sets us apart from other database providers in the market.","5681":"Our focus this quarter has been on improving our user engagement and providing more meaningful experiences for our community. [SEP] So in the Facebook app overall after helping people connect with friends and family, helping people connected with communities is the next most important social problem that we believe we can help address and that\u2019s just going to be an area of increasing value in the product. [SEP] We are also exploring new features and tools that will allow users to better connect with their local communities and find relevant events and activities.","5682":"As we look to the future of our advertising business, we see mobile as a key driver of growth. [SEP] And we're working hard to help advertisers develop the video creative that really works for mobile [SEP] In fact, our mobile video offerings have seen a 20% increase in engagement rates over the past quarter, indicating that we're on the right track.","5683":"We have been working hard to streamline our development process and improve efficiency in every aspect of our operations. [SEP] And that will apply across basically every product that we build at the company. [SEP] This focus on optimization has resulted in significant cost savings and improved profitability for the company.","5684":"We are pleased to report strong earnings for the quarter and a significant increase in revenue. We have carefully analyzed our expenses and made several strategic investments to drive growth. [SEP] It should also impact our need and our timing of capital. [SEP] As a result, we anticipate a decrease in our operating expenses over the next few quarters. We will be reevaluating our investment strategy to ensure we are best positioned to capitalize on this shift in the market.","5685":"Our team has been focused on identifying the most effective strategies for increasing revenue. [SEP] So we're currently working on making it so that that is the highest ROI thing. [SEP] We believe that by prioritizing this initiative, we can significantly improve our bottom line and drive sustained growth.","5686":"Our recent marketing campaign has been a huge success. [SEP] And that's showing up in the marketplace. [SEP] We've seen a significant uptick in sales and customer engagement.","5687":"Now let's talk about our transition to the cloud. [SEP] And that's because first of all the move to the cloud combines a whole bunch of different categories as well as takes something that you mentioned, which is Linux. [SEP] So overall, the move to the cloud has been a game-changer for our company's technology infrastructure.","5688":"We are constantly exploring new ways to enhance our customers' experience on our platform. One of the initiatives we are currently working on is redesigning our app interface to make it more user-friendly and intuitive. [SEP] I think that's going to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers. [SEP] In addition, we are also using data analytics to personalize the advertisements that our customers receive, making the ad experience more relevant and engaging. These efforts have resulted in increased customer engagement and advertiser satisfaction, and we are excited to continue optimizing our platform for both parties.","5689":"During the past quarter, we have witnessed robust momentum across our various business segments. Despite the unprecedented business environment, we have delivered exceptional results, exceeding our expectations. Our cloud business, which constitutes one of the largest portions of our revenue stream, continued to witness strong growth. [SEP] But we're also seeing quite good growth in some of the Consumer businesses, which also are built on our cloud infrastructure, Search, some of our gaming assets, our Xbox Live business going forward. [SEP] Looking ahead, we maintain a positive outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Our investments in innovation, automation, and AI will continue to drive top-line growth and margins. We are also stepping up our efforts to expand our consumer businesses, with a particular focus on gaming and search. Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of the company.","5690":"Can you discuss how decision-making has evolved within the company over the past year? [SEP] It\u2019s a senior leadership team concept and the leadership environment that I think we're making collective decisions faster. [SEP] Overall, I believe this shift in leadership philosophy has contributed greatly to our recent successes and will continue to drive growth in the future.","5691":"Our Prime program remains a key driver of growth and customer loyalty. [SEP] We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter. [SEP] We are also excited to announce the launch of Alexa-powered shopping in France and Italy in the coming months.","5692":"We're now going to discuss our latest iPhone models, the XS and XS Max. [SEP] The XS and XS Max got off to a really great start and we've only been selling for a few weeks. [SEP] We've seen a high level of demand for the XS Max in particular, with many customers upgrading from previous iPhone models. We're confident that the XS and XS Max will continue to be strong performers in the coming months.","5693":"We have been tracking consumer behavior and market trends closely. [SEP] We are pretty careful and thoughtful about where we increase prices and when and by how much during mid-cycle [SEP] We want to ensure that our customers continue to see the value in our products and services.","5694":"Now, turning to our video advertising performance. [SEP] It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s not just large brand advertisers that are doing video but all of our market segments. [SEP] In fact, we've seen an increase in demand for video ads from small businesses and even individual content creators on our platform.","5695":"As we continue to focus on growth and expansion, there are a few key areas that we believe will be critical to our success. [SEP] The second piece is of course around empowering your employees. [SEP] We recognize that our employees are the backbone of our organization, and their knowledge and expertise are essential to driving innovation and delivering exceptional customer experiences.","5696":"We have been closely monitoring the performance of our new product line over the past quarter. [SEP] I think there are some promising signs. [SEP] Our sales team has also reported positive feedback from key clients regarding our products, which is encouraging.","5697":"Moving on to our technology update for Q2, I'd like to address a few key developments in our cloud computing division. [SEP] On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption and machine learning services especially Amazon Sage Maker. [SEP] Our team has been hard at work developing new features and capabilities for Sage Maker, and we're excited to see how our customers are leveraging these tools to improve their businesses.","5698":"Our enterprise segment has been performing extremely well this quarter. [SEP] And SMB looks very similar in some ways. [SEP] However, we have encountered some challenges with our consumer market.","5699":"We've seen continued success with our Atlas platform and are excited to share some updates with you today. [SEP] And so our focus with Atlas is helping people really understand the results they get with ads. [SEP] We've also been investing in new machine learning technology to improve our targeting capabilities and drive even better results for our advertisers.","5700":"We've had to work through some technical issues with the new software integration. [SEP] But we're pleased that the test is active. [SEP] We anticipate it will bring significant efficiencies to our production process once fully integrated.","5701":"In response to a question about how a recent product launch had been performing. [SEP] So it's early, but you're right, we did see some incremental improvement over what we expected. [SEP] And we're optimistic that we can continue to build on that momentum moving forward.","5702":"We've been seeing a lot of interest from our customers in using our mobile app to research and purchase automobiles. [SEP] And I think they know that people are doing the research for autos and the purchases they make, which is a very long sales cycle on their mobile phone, and they want us to be part of that. [SEP] That's why we've been investing heavily in improving our mobile app's functionality and user experience, to make sure we're meeting our customers' needs and staying ahead of the competition.","5703":"We've had great success in building partnerships with some of the biggest players in the industry. \n- Our strategy has always been to work with the most innovative developers out there. [SEP] And so I see Tencent as one of our biggest and best developers. [SEP] We're excited to continue working with Tencent and exploring new opportunities for growth. \n- Their expertise in mobile gaming and online communities aligns perfectly with our vision for the future.","5704":"We're very pleased with the recent acquisition of XYZ company. [SEP] So they definitely are margin accretive for us, but most importantly, they add a tremendous amount of value to the customers. [SEP] We've received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our customers since incorporating these products into our offering.","5705":"Our Q4 earnings results are in and I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our expectations. Our revenue for the quarter was up by 15% compared to the same period last year.

[SEP] The growth in our installed base can be attributed to our successful marketing campaigns and partnerships with key industry players. Looking ahead, we are confident that we will continue to see strong performance in the coming quarters. Thank you all for your support and we look forward to updating you again soon.","5706":"Now let's move on to the factors that impacted our earnings this quarter. [SEP] I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth objectives.","5707":"We're really excited about the progress we've made in our advertising efforts. We believe we're providing a lot of value to our advertisers and users. [SEP] And one of the ways I talk to people about it is just ask what percentage of the ads do you see in your feed are as good as the very best posts you see from friends. [SEP] When we ask people this question, we generally get a very low percentage in response. That's why we're continuing to work on improving the quality of our ads and making them more relevant to individual users. We believe this will ultimately lead to greater success for our advertising partners and a better experience for our users.","5708":"We are currently implementing changes to our business strategy to better meet the needs of our customers. [SEP] Transitions take time. [SEP] However, we believe that these changes will ultimately lead to long-term success for our company.","5709":"We have seen an increase in demand for organic produce. [SEP] It's not necessarily common on AmazonFresh. [SEP] However, we are working to expand our selection of organic options on the platform.","5710":"We have seen strong growth in our international markets. [SEP] Secondly, the products have been extremely well received there. [SEP] Moving forward, we plan to increase our investments in these markets to drive continued growth.","5711":"Our analysis shows that our marketing campaigns are effectively converting customers from our competitors.

[SEP] This is happening in IT. [SEP] Our team is excited about the opportunities this presents for us in the coming year.","5713":"We are seeing some exciting developments in our technology division that I wanted to highlight. [SEP] Yes, I mean, one of the things that I talked about in my remarks this time was this power platform. [SEP] We believe this power platform has the potential to significantly enhance our product offerings and generate meaningful revenue growth in the years ahead.","5714":"As we continue to invest in the growth of our business, we remain committed to giving back to the communities we serve. [SEP] To share one example, a local e-commerce jewelry brand called Lokai started donating 10% of their net profits to charitable partners. [SEP] This not only aligns with our values as a company, but it has also resonated with our customers, leading to increased sales and brand loyalty. We are proud to support Lokai and other socially conscious businesses as we work towards building a better world.","5715":"We have been exploring various emerging markets to tap into potential growth opportunities. [SEP] But because the smartphones that are working there are low end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there. [SEP] However, we remain committed to investing in and expanding our presence in emerging markets, as we believe they will play a key role in our long-term growth strategy.","5716":"We understand how important it is to our users to have a clean and seamless experience on our platform. [SEP] So, we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. [SEP] We are constantly seeking feedback from our users and making adjustments to our advertising approach based on their preferences.","5717":"As we look to the future of our platform and content offerings... [SEP] I mean, there's always a richer way that people want to share and consume thoughts and ideas and I think that immersive 3D content is the obvious next thing after video. [SEP] This is why we are increasingly investing in 3D technology and partnering with creators to develop more immersive experiences for our users.","5718":"Moving on to our sales figures, I'm pleased to report that we have seen a steady increase in the percentage of third-party units within our paid units in the last quarter. [SEP] Third-party units are now up to 48% of paid units and that's up 400 basis points year-over-year, so that continues to be a factor in gross margin. [SEP] Despite the impact on gross margin, we remain committed to our strategy of collaborating with third-party sellers as it enables us to offer a wider variety of products to our customers. \n\nAdditional sentence: Furthermore, we have implemented measures to ensure that our third-party sellers comply with our strict quality and safety guidelines to maintain the integrity of our brand.","5719":"We were concerned about the dip we experienced in sales last quarter. [SEP] So we saw a little bit of a rebound there. [SEP] However, we don't anticipate this rebound to significantly impact our Q3 projections.","5720":"We made the strategic decision to invest heavily in research and development this past quarter. [SEP] And so we are - we feel great about doing that. [SEP] We believe that these investments will position us for strong future growth and ultimately lead to increased shareholder value.","5721":"We're seeing great success with our expansion efforts overseas, particularly in Europe and Asia. [SEP] And of course we still have a lot of merchants left in the U.S. [SEP] We're confident that our continued growth in these regions, coupled with our already strong presence in the U.S., will result in sustained long-term revenue growth for the company.","5722":"Our company has been evaluating our long-term strategic goals and have identified an area that requires significant attention. We believe this will be a game changer for us and impact our growth trajectory for years to come. [SEP] For the time frame for this, I think that this is going to be a central focus for the company for the next five years or longer. [SEP] We have already begun the process of allocating resources and assembling a top-tier team to tackle this initiative. Our goal is to become a leader in this area and capture a sizable market share. We are excited for the opportunities and challenges ahead.","5723":"We have seen significant growth in our Office 365 subscriptions, with over 37 million active subscribers as of last quarter. [SEP] The other aspect of Office 365 which is important for us is the international element because we really never had very high penetration of our higher-end service SKUs in the international markets. [SEP] However, with the rollout of Office 365 in new international markets and the increasing demand for cloud-based productivity tools, we expect to see significant growth in the adoption of our higher-end service SKUs in these regions.","5724":"As we look at the future of our business, we are constantly evaluating our operations. [SEP] Even on the operations side, we are realizing that even if you keep your financials the same, there is need, and with increasing digitization, there is more operational modules that you need. [SEP] We are investing heavily in new technologies and identifying efficient processes to stay ahead of the competition.","5725":"We've seen a lot of positive momentum in our new business segment. [SEP] But at this point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast. [SEP] We believe that by the end of the year, we'll have a sizable presence in the majority of major metropolitan areas in the country.","5726":"We're really continuing to invest in Instagram. We're really pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. [SEP] So it maps where we\u2019ve got good adoption of Instagram globally.

We're also seeing great progress with video on Instagram, including with our IGTV product.","5727":"Our customer service representatives have undergone extensive training to ensure they can provide personalized and efficient service to our customers. We believe that this will lead to greater customer satisfaction and loyalty. [SEP] They can have a better dialogue with the person and a persistent relationship.

We will continue to prioritize building strong relationships with our customers to drive business growth and success.","5728":"Our team has been working hard to accelerate our growth in the marketplace. We are excited to share our progress with you today. [SEP] So we're not only bringing people who have traditionally worked with us, helping them replat to a completely new model but we're also bringing a lot of new ISVs into the fold as well and that's pretty exciting to see. [SEP] These new ISVs bring fresh ideas and perspectives to our platform, and we're already seeing the positive impact of their contributions. We look forward to continued growth and success as we expand our team and offerings.","5729":"We are now going to move on to discussing our company's performance and future outlook. [SEP] The layer about that for me is the data state, one of the exciting things is the growth in Azure DB, the growth in Cosmos DB, data warehouse product, the Datalake, so that is a place where we are seeing significant attach. [SEP] Overall, our data-driven products continue to show strong growth and adoption among our clients, which gives us a lot of confidence moving forward.","5730":"We have received a question from one of our investors asking about the drivers behind our recent quarterly growth. [SEP] Any growth acceleration or deceleration that you see can be very much tied to the total sales of the customer - that we have the customers in any country. [SEP] As a result, our strategy focuses on expanding our customer base in existing markets and exploring opportunities to enter new markets around the world.","5731":"We've been analyzing our business model and have decided to make some strategic changes. [SEP] So it's very important to us that we have the right business profile, both for Amazon and for the sellers. [SEP] That's why we're introducing new programs to help sellers improve their online presence and increase their sales.","5732":"We are seeing a significant increase in demand across all of our product lines. [SEP] but it's broad-based. [SEP] This growth is being driven by a combination of market expansion and increased market share.","5733":"Now, I would like to turn to our growth trajectory in international markets. [SEP] And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities in these markets and remain committed to expanding our reach globally.","5734":"We had a strong quarter overall, with revenue growth of 48% year-over-year. [SEP] But specific to core Facebook, I think those are some of the drivers that I'd call out. [SEP] Looking ahead, we are focused on continuing to innovate and improve the user experience on our platforms.","5735":"As we look ahead to the future of our company, there are several key initiatives that we believe will help drive growth and maximize value for our shareholders. [SEP] Another area where I'm really excited about this is our ability to keep the community safe, right? [SEP] We're investing heavily in new technology and partnerships to help us stay ahead of emerging threats and keep our users protected at all times.","5736":"One of the key metrics that has been a focus for us this quarter has been average revenue per user (ARPU). [SEP] This quarter and a little bit last I actually think some of the ARPU increase has been masked by some of the trends in seat growth. [SEP] However, as we continue to analyze the data, we're beginning to see a clearer picture of how ARPU is actually trending.","5737":"Can you speak to how the cloud has changed the way you develop and launch new products? [SEP] But one of the things that the cloud, to your point, makes fundamentally possible is the opportunity for us to quickly iterate the opportunity's billed value and deploy it more quickly to customers [SEP] How has this shift in approach impacted customer satisfaction and adoption?","5738":"We've seen a shift in consumer behavior over the past year. [SEP] And so I think there's some things like that are going on. [SEP] However, we're confident that our company's diverse product offerings will continue to drive growth.","5739":"One of the key drivers of our growth this quarter has been the continued success of our digital offerings. [SEP] So we're very happy with the linkage between our digital offerings in the Prime customer base. [SEP] As we look ahead to next quarter, we're eager to build off this momentum and continue to invest in our digital capabilities, ensuring our Prime customers have the best possible experience.","5740":"We've been exploring new ways to enhance the user experience on Facebook. [SEP] So we experiment with all these things in terms of some of them make sense to naturally have inside the Facebook app because you're using the same set of friends and network and connections. [SEP] However, there are other features and services that might be better suited outside of the core Facebook app, which is why we've also been developing standalone apps and platforms.","5741":"We've seen some impressive growth over the past few quarters. [SEP] But I think we\u2019re just on the front end. [SEP] There's still so much potential in this market, and I believe we're well positioned to continue expanding our reach.","5742":"We are excited about the growth opportunities in the social media space and are exploring new ways to leverage our platform. [SEP] Once we start to get more of a critical mass, I think you can start to get social applications, which is what we as a company are more interested in over the long term and think have a huge amount of potential in addition to the video and gaming stuff, which I just think is going to be awesome in the next few years as well. [SEP] Our focus on social applications is part of our broader strategy to become a leader in the digital media industry and create value for our shareholders.","5743":"Now moving on to our health initiatives. [SEP] And in terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the health app, really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can easily go from doctor to doctor. [SEP] This aligns with our overall goal of empowering individuals to take control of their own health and wellness.","5744":"A question from Mark on the earnings call was regarding the profitability of Azure. [SEP] Just to add one thing that I\u2019d say is sort of -- to Mark\u2019s question, which is in particular on Azure, we have some commodity workloads but we also have many differentiated higher margin workloads especially in the Enterprise Mobility Suite is what I\u2019d call out is a good example of an infrastructure workload completely in the cloud that has got a very different margin structure. [SEP] Overall, we continue to see strong growth and profitability in our cloud services division, driven by a combination of these commodity and differentiated workloads.","5745":"Can you talk more about the competitive landscape within the advertising industry? How do you differentiate yourselves from other companies? [SEP] And so we think what we offer is the power of the broad reach of TV, but an ability to target much more efficiently. [SEP] Additionally, how do you see the future of TV advertising evolving in a world where more people are consuming content through streaming services? And how are you addressing the issue of ad fatigue among viewers?","5746":"We've been trying out some new initiatives to help us grow our business and stay ahead of the competition. [SEP] So, yeah, it's still early days and some of those experiments that we're doing, but we're seeing good traction on those things and we like that. [SEP] We're planning to continue investing in these experiments to see how they pan out in the long term and what kind of impact they could have on our bottom line.","5747":"We've had a lot of questions from investors about our plans for expanding production. [SEP] So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity add additional cost to Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we build the additional capacity. [SEP] However, we anticipate that this investment will result in significant long-term growth and profitability for the company.","5748":"We are seeing significant growth in our cloud business, driven by the acceleration of digital transformation across all industries. [SEP] In some sense, if you compare it to the TAM of STB versus what we now describe as intelligent cloud, we're operating in a much bigger market. [SEP] We have been investing heavily in our intelligent cloud platform, and we believe we are well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growing market.","5749":"Our revenue growth in the past quarter has been driven by our successful efforts to expand our client base and diversify our revenue streams. [SEP] We have an opportunity to turn those businesses into advertisers and marketers, and that's what we've done successfully and we're going to continue to focus on that. [SEP] By leveraging our data and analytics capabilities, we've been able to deliver highly targeted and effective advertising campaigns for our clients across a range of platforms and channels.","5750":"Another area of growth for our business has been through social media advertising, specifically on Facebook. [SEP] That said, we are pleased by what's happened on Facebook for the elections cycle, not just on the paid side but actually on the organic side as well. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to analyze this success and come up with new strategies for future social media campaigns.","5751":"We have been closely monitoring consumer behavior and have seen significant changes over the past year.\n- We believe that our approach to advertising is unique, and it allows us to provide significant value to both advertisers and consumers.

[SEP] Our transactional revenue will have a headwind from XP. [SEP] However, we have identified several opportunities for growth in our subscription-based services.","5753":"Now moving on to our product performance. [SEP] And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad. [SEP] We are very pleased with the strong adoption of our latest product offerings.","5754":"Now I want to give you an update on our staffing numbers. As you all know, we've been expanding rapidly over the past year, and we'd like to share some details with you today. [SEP] In general, I would say our head count growth has skewed towards the R&D side [SEP] Although we've also hired a fair number of sales and marketing professionals, we've made a deliberate push to invest in our research and development teams. We believe that this will pay dividends over the long term, as we develop new products and technologies that can keep us ahead of our competitors. So while we're always mindful of our overall headcount budget, we'll continue to focus on expanding our R&D capabilities in the coming quarters.","5755":"Our developers have been hard at work, pushing out new updates and features. Our QA team has been working diligently to ensure that everything is tested and functioning properly. [SEP] There's definitely dev\/test happening.

We appreciate the hard work and dedication of our development and QA teams in ensuring the success of our company.","5756":"Our content offerings have continued to grow and diversify over the past year. [SEP] We've done some things like the Prime Original Series All or Nothing; the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. [SEP] In addition, we are excited about the upcoming release of several highly anticipated films and series, and we believe these will continue to drive engagement and growth across our platform.","5757":"Can you provide an update on how our different business segments are performing? [SEP] On the auto and insurance verticals, they're both still small which makes them good opportunities to grow. [SEP] We've seen some success in our efforts to expand into those verticals, but we recognize that it will take time to compete with established players in that space. Nonetheless, we feel confident that we can capture a significant share of the market over the long term.","5758":"Can you give us some context around the percentage increase in revenue this quarter? [SEP] It's still less than 20%. [SEP] Do you have any plans in place to increase this percentage in the future?\"\n\n\"It's still less than 20%,\" replied the CFO. \"While we're happy with the progress we've made, we know there's a lot of room for growth in this area. Our team is working on several initiatives that we believe will help increase this percentage over the next few quarters.","5759":"Our Prime program has continued to be a significant driver of growth for the company. As we reported in our earnings release, the program saw a 30% increase in membership over the past year. [SEP] So we are very happy with the - not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. [SEP] We have also seen an increase in the number of Prime members who are taking advantage of our streaming video and music services, as well as our grocery delivery offerings. We believe that this sort of engagement is key to the continued success of the Prime program and the company as a whole.","5760":"Our team has been working hard to implement new technology and processes. [SEP] And we now have the ability to be much more dynamic. [SEP] This will allow us to respond quickly to changes in the market and better meet the needs of our customers.","5761":"Our consolidated revenue for the quarter was $80 billion. [SEP] Prime memberships are included in that line. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in Prime memberships over the past quarter, a trend we believe will continue into the next quarter.","5762":"Now, turning our attention to the financial results for the fourth quarter of the year. [SEP] Those two items impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by about 300 basis points. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we were still able to achieve a 6% overall growth rate for the fiscal year.","5763":"We saw significant growth in our cloud offerings last year, with an increase in adoption from both existing and new customers. [SEP] And so as you think about 2017, with the continued acceleration of our cloud mix and actually continued momentum in annuity, I would expect to see those same pressures continue to exist [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders.","5764":"We have seen some great success stories with our clients this quarter. [SEP] So to share one example, Motorola working with Ogilvy and Moto Mento (28:55) launched the Moto Z phone, and they did awareness boosting before they launched, targeting Android users and Verizon subscribers. [SEP] This campaign resulted in impressive pre-orders and a successful launch, exceeding our client's expectations. We are excited to see what other innovative campaigns our clients will come up with in the coming months.","5765":"We've seen a lot of growth in our technology department over the past few years. [SEP] It\u2019s really followed technological change, if you think back even four years, you can\u2019t really take a video, a lot of videos buffered on your phone. [SEP] Now, with advancements in 5G technology, our users can stream high-quality video content seamlessly on their mobile devices.","5766":"We have been closely monitoring our customers' needs and adjusting our strategy accordingly. [SEP] So it's those higher level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I think is accelerating and that's something that obviously we didn't make the decision last quarter to do that. [SEP] However, we are confident that these investments will position us for significant growth in the long term.","5767":"We have experienced significant growth in our online sales over the past year. [SEP] So again, that's a big part of our model. [SEP] We plan to continue investing in our online platform to further improve the customer experience.","5768":"We've been focusing on improving the user experience on our platform. [SEP] And that's great, it converts better for the businesses. [SEP] Additionally, we've seen an increase in our net promoter score since implementing these changes.","5769":"One area of growth that we are particularly excited about is our services division. [SEP] A perfect example would be an Apple Care agreement that you purchase at the time of the sale of the device. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in attach rates for our service offerings, demonstrating the value that customers place on these add-on options.","5770":"During the quarter, we continued to focus on expanding our customer base and increasing engagement with our existing clients. We believe that our unique value proposition and differentiated offerings position us well for long-term growth. [SEP] If you ask even our largest clients, our largest clients, if they drew a pie chart of where their consumer spend their time and money and whether they spend their time, we\u2019re still under-indexed. [SEP] That being said, we made significant progress in expanding our market share during the quarter. Our efforts to enhance our product offerings and improve customer experience are paying off, and we are seeing strong demand for our services.\n\nLooking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our business to drive growth and capture market share. We believe that our strategic priorities and disciplined execution will continue to yield positive results for our customers and shareholders.","5771":"Now let's turn our attention to our advertising strategy and recent updates. [SEP] So you've seen us work on dynamic ads, carousel ads, estimated store visits. [SEP] We're constantly exploring new ways to engage with consumers and drive sales, so you can expect to see more innovations in this area moving forward.","5772":"Our focus has always been on delivering the best possible services to our customers and in order to achieve that, we continue to invest heavily in the development of new technologies and services. [SEP] You can see us continue to invest in things like new application services, higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continuing to add functionality for data analytics, mobile, Internet of things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers. [SEP] With every passing day, we are working tirelessly to add new features and services that are designed to cater to the evolving needs of our customers and help them achieve their business objectives.","5773":"Can you provide some insight into the areas of the business that are driving growth? [SEP] But there is also F1, which is increasing the overall penetration and not to mention the small business segment, and of course all the markets that we participate in with Office 365 where we don't have much of a server business at all. [SEP] Do you anticipate any changes to your strategy to address this shift away from traditional server software?","5774":"We've been closely monitoring the performance of our investments for this quarter. [SEP] And are they earning the right return? [SEP] We believe that by continuously evaluating and optimizing our portfolio, we can ensure that we're maximizing shareholder value.","5775":"Our Q3 results reflect the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations. [SEP] And we guided to 38.5% to 39.5%, which is slightly down versus our performance in Q2. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our ability to bounce back in Q4 and beyond as we adapt to the current landscape.","5776":"We take user safety very seriously, and we're constantly working towards making our platform a safe and trustworthy place for everyone. One area where we're focused on making improvements is in combating misinformation and harmful content. [SEP] The same goes for things around election interference and more proactively looking for inauthentic behavior. [SEP] We've made some progress, but we know there's still a lot of work to be done to ensure that bad actors aren't able to manipulate our platform. We're committed to investing in the technology and resources necessary to make this happen, and we're confident that with continued effort we can make real progress in these areas.","5777":"Our advertising revenue has continued to grow at a steady pace over the past quarter, as we have seen a surge in demand for our ad products,\" said the CEO. [SEP] We already have 5 million advertisers on Facebook, 1 million advertisers on Instagram. [SEP] We are constantly working to enhance our advertising solutions and provide greater value to our advertisers,\" added the CFO. \"We are optimistic about the future growth potential of our advertising business.","5778":"We were discussing the challenges and opportunities that our industry has faced over the years. [SEP] AI technology was not developed at the time. [SEP] However, looking forward, we are excited about the potential that AI technology can bring to our company and customers.","5779":"Our team has been working diligently on the implementation of E5 over the past few months. We wanted to make sure that we were fully prepared for the shift in our operations. [SEP] And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5. [SEP] However, we anticipate that E5 will continue to drive growth for us over the coming quarters. Our analysis shows that the benefits of this implementation will be long-lasting and substantially improve our financial position.","5780":"We've been focused on optimizing our cost structure, and we're starting to see some significant improvements there. As we continue to scale our business, we expect to see additional benefits in terms of cost efficiencies. [SEP] Some of the fixed costs, frankly, even in COGS, tend to come down as a percentage over time. [SEP] Of course, there are also variable costs that we need to manage carefully. We've implemented a number of initiatives to improve our supply chain and reduce our cost of goods sold, and we're confident that these efforts will continue to pay off over the long term. Overall, we're very pleased with the progress we've made in optimizing our cost structure, and we believe that we're well positioned to continue driving growth and profitability in the years ahead.","5781":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our growth strategy. [SEP] As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last \u2013 fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. [SEP] Our focus this year is on international expansion, and we plan to open 30 new fulfillment centers in Europe and Asia.","5782":"One of our main objectives for this year is to improve our customer experience. [SEP] So we will try different delivery methods or pick-up points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now. [SEP] However, we have recently invested in our online ordering system to make it more user-friendly and efficient for our customers.","5783":"We're now going to move on to discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter. [SEP] Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. [SEP] We're confident that our focus on operational efficiency and improving customer experience will continue to drive growth for the company in the coming quarters.","5784":"We're constantly looking at new and innovative ways for people to share and engage with each other on our platforms. And video continues to be a key way that people communicate and express themselves. [SEP] We're seeing it with Instagram Stories and with Messenger and the initial test that we have with Messenger Day, where that is another interesting format for how you can put videos together. [SEP] We're also exploring ways to further integrate video into our products, particularly in our messaging apps. We believe video will continue to play an important role in how people connect and communicate, and we're excited to continue to explore new formats and ways to enhance the user experience.","5785":"We have been working hard to improve our profit margins over the past year. [SEP] And our goal is to get that to be as high as possible. [SEP] We believe that by focusing on cost-cutting measures and increasing efficiency, we can continue to drive up our profitability.","5786":"Now, let's discuss the factors that contributed to our growth in the prior year. [SEP] Then, the way that growth was driven in the prior year. [SEP] Moving forward, we will be focusing on scaling our successful growth strategies to drive even further expansion.","5787":"Our team worked tirelessly to make this year's Prime Day the biggest and best yet,\" said the CEO.

[SEP] We are thrilled with the results and thank our loyal customers for their continued support,\" said the CFO. \"We are looking forward to building on this success for next year's Prime Day.","5788":"We had a strong quarter overall, with solid growth in many of our international markets and continued stability in our domestic business. [SEP] The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018. [SEP] Despite these factors, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results in the coming quarters and to capitalize on the many exciting opportunities that lie ahead.","5789":"We've been focused on expanding our presence in emerging markets over the past few years, and we've made some considerable strides in that area. [SEP] And what -- the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect and so that's what we think matters the most really. [SEP] Of course, emerging markets do come with their own set of challenges, but we believe that the potential for growth and profitability makes it a worthwhile endeavor for our company.","5790":"Our revenue growth has been impressive this quarter, thanks to our strong customer base and successful product launches. However, we believe there is still room for growth and we are taking steps to expand our reach. [SEP] We continue to invest in marketing and advertising. [SEP] Our marketing campaigns have been well received and we have seen a significant increase in brand awareness. We will continue to explore new channels and strategies to drive customer acquisition and build loyalty. Ultimately, our goal is to further solidify our position as a market leader and generate sustainable long-term growth.","5791":"We've had some really exciting developments in our original programming. [SEP] The Man in the High Castle was actually our most-watched pilot, so we're excited about that one as well. [SEP] We're looking forward to bringing more great content to our viewers in the coming months.","5792":"Our decision to shift our focus to e-commerce has been paying off in a big way,\" the CEO said. [SEP] because that really makes a really big difference. [SEP] We've seen a 40% increase in online sales since we implemented our new strategy,\" the CFO added, \"and we believe that trend will continue as more and more consumers turn to online shopping.\"\n\nOverall statement: \"Our decision to shift our focus to e-commerce has been paying off in a big way,\" the CEO said, \"because that really makes a really big difference.\" \"We've seen a 40% increase in online sales since we implemented our new strategy,\" the CFO added, \"and we believe that trend will continue as more and more consumers turn to online shopping.","5793":"Our company has been focused on providing high-quality services to our customers for many years. As we continue to grow and expand our reach, we are seeing some interesting trends in how our customers interact with us. [SEP] So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services over time tend spend more and more on our services. [SEP] This is a very encouraging sign for our business, as it suggests that our services are delivering real value to our customers. We are excited to continue developing new and innovative offerings that can help us build even stronger relationships with our customers over time. As we look ahead to the future, we remain committed to delivering excellent service and driving sustainable growth for our company.","5794":"Our revenue has increased by 15% this quarter. [SEP] Advertising is the biggest piece of that. [SEP] We allocated a significant portion of our budget towards marketing and branding efforts in order to drive consumer engagement.","5795":"Looking ahead, I want to talk about our strategy for Office 365 and Microsoft 365. [SEP] Our goal and I think the real opportunity that remains with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 going forward, is our ability to continue to grow the installed base, and to also continue to grow our ARPU. [SEP] To achieve this, we are investing heavily in product development, sales and marketing, and customer support to ensure our customers see the value in upgrading to our premium packages.","5796":"During the past quarter, our company has experienced tremendous growth in several key areas.

As we previously announced, we prioritized investments in capacity and infrastructure in the first half of the year to position us for the second half. [SEP] This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. [SEP] We remain on track to open a total of 30 net FCs in 2021, which will significantly improve our ability to serve customers even faster and more efficiently. I'm very pleased with the team's execution so far this year, and we're confident in our ability to continue expanding our network at a brisk pace going forward.","5800":"During the quarter, we invested heavily in our digital platform and saw strong growth in our online sales.

[SEP] I think we're going to need many more than 33,000. [SEP] We'll be exploring our options for expanding our workforce in order to meet this demand.","5802":"Thank you for the question. [SEP] To the question on the demand signals we're seeing in the U.S. in particular - I think, it is quite early, but as we said the U.S. has been a good market for us and a strong market for us for a good period of time, and it was again in Q2, as we noted. [SEP] We are closely monitoring the situation, but currently, our outlook for the U.S. market remains positive due to the strength of our business and product offerings. Additionally, we are also seeing strong demand signals in other regions, particularly in Asia and Europe. Overall, we are optimistic about the growth potential of our business and are committed to delivering value for our shareholders.","5803":"We are now moving on to discussing our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] Well, as I said, on revenue we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion.

We're excited about the progress we've made so far, and we remain committed to delivering innovative, high-quality products and services to our customers.","5805":"We have a question from the analyst on the line regarding your relationship with your partners. [SEP] And of course, that means we have a trusted relationship, which is a competitive advantage in a world where some of our competitors have more complex business models, where in some cases they give them platforms, in other cases where they compete with them or tax them. [SEP] Can you give us some examples of how this trusted relationship has benefited the company in terms of revenue or market share?","5806":"We've seen a tremendous increase in demand for our software solutions, particularly within the realm of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management. Our Dynamics 365 platform has been a significant contributor to this growth. [SEP] And that's where I think we have an architectural advantage again with Dynamics 365.

We will continue to invest in and enhance this platform to meet the changing needs of our customers and maintain our competitive edge.","5807":"Our new product line has received very positive feedback from customers and is expected to generate significant revenue growth.

Moving forward, we plan to build on this momentum and continue to invest in our retail division to drive even greater growth and profitability in the future.","5813":"Our Messenger business has been seeing some impressive growth over the past quarter,\" the speaker began. \"But we do want to temper expectations moving forward. [SEP] But if there's one message here that I think is actually important to say, it's that we're trying to communicate that the pace of growing the Messenger business, it's a longer-term thing. [SEP] We don't want investors to think that this is going to happen overnight. It's going to take time to build up Messenger's capabilities and integrate it with our other products,\" the speaker continued. \"But we're confident that the growth we're seeing now is just the beginning of what's possible for this platform.","5814":"We've identified two key areas that we want to prioritize in the upcoming quarter.

[SEP] We believe that by placing more emphasis on these experiences, we'll be able to drive user engagement and increase our overall user base.","5815":"Our revenue for the quarter was slightly below expectations due to a challenging retail environment.

We believe that our solutions will continue to be instrumental in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process in years to come.","5819":"During the quarter, we saw strong growth in our emerging markets division, particularly in India. We are excited about the potential for further expansion in this region. [SEP] But I view India as where China was maybe seven to ten years ago from that point of view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there. [SEP] We have already begun investing in the Indian market with the opening of several new retail locations and increased marketing efforts. Our team on the ground has been impressed with the enthusiasm and interest from local consumers. We believe that India will be a key driver of our future growth.","5820":"Can you give us an update on your content strategy? [SEP] So, we are experimenting with a lot of formats.

Our growth in the U.S. market has been steady and we see a lot of potential for further expansion.","5824":"We've been receiving a lot of positive feedback from our customers and industry experts.

It's something we take very seriously and are proud of our track record. [SEP] And when you look at our track record of what we\u2019ve done over the last several years, you\u2019ve seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow.

We are already working on the next generation of Watch, incorporating even more groundbreaking features.","5875":"I'd like to provide some context on our revenue growth over the past few quarters.

We will be launching this feature in the coming months and are confident that it will be well received by our users.","5877":"Our marketing team has been working hard to improve our advertising strategies and make them more effective.

Specifically, we are looking to increase penetration in places like Asia and Europe. [SEP] And China doesn't possess the level of fiber that some other countries do, and so in order to get the great video performance, et cetera, raising that penetration is really great.

The ability to target specific audiences and track performance metrics has allowed us to optimize our ad spend and maximize ROI.","5903":"We've been focused on driving growth across all of our businesses, and we've made significant progress in that area.

[SEP] As a result of these efforts, we are confident in our ability to continue growing revenue and delivering strong margins in the coming quarters.","5912":"Our company's net sales have increased by 28% compared to last year's numbers. [SEP] If you look at Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day. [SEP] We experienced a significant surge in the number of people who signed up for our Prime membership program during this event.","5913":"We've been seeing some incredible growth in our cloud-based services over the last quarter, and a lot of this has been driven by the success of our Azure platform. [SEP] And then one linchpin that we have between, in fact, our SaaS services, as well as Azure is Azure active trajectory. [SEP] With the addition of new features and improved integration with our other products, we believe that Azure active trajectory will continue to be a key driver of growth for our company going forward.","5914":"When looking at our international business, we're pleased to report solid results for the quarter. [SEP] The trend we saw there, as I said, we're 5% up in a constant currency basis. [SEP] This growth can be attributed to strong sales in our European and Asian markets, offsetting challenges in Latin America. We will continue to analyze and invest in these regions to drive sustained growth.","5915":"Now moving on to our segment revenue breakdown for the quarter. [SEP] So a bit of it was mix, but I would say this retail, which has a lower gross margin more because of the revenue treatment was stronger in Q4. [SEP] In contrast, our online sales experienced a slight dip in gross margin due to increased promotional activity during the holiday season.","5916":"In terms of externalities, we had a couple of big ones this quarter that we wanted to call out. The first was in Office 365 where we saw a significant increase in transactional purchases, driven in large part by the pandemic and the shift to remote work. [SEP] So if you think about that being the next major transactional type purchase that was driven a year ago as the first externality, the second was in Windows [DL] [ph] we also saw non-annuity purchases in Windows DL which again is in our commercial licensing segment. [SEP] Overall, we're seeing strong growth in our commercial licensing segment, driven by both annuity and non-annuity purchases. And we're optimistic about the future as we continue to invest in new products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","5917":"In terms of our sales performance, we saw a significant jump in revenue during Q2 compared to Q1. [SEP] If you recall, we were heavily supply constrained throughout the whole of Q1 and so some of that demand moved into Q2. [SEP] Looking ahead, we anticipate a strong demand for our products throughout the rest of the year and are working hard to ramp up production to meet this demand.","5918":"I'd like to address our thoughts on the upcoming elections. [SEP] On the elections and political activity and political advertising, we're excited about the elections [SEP] We believe there will be a significant increase in political advertising spending during this time, and we're optimistic about the potential revenue opportunities for our company.","5919":"Can you provide an update on the growth of AmazonFresh? [SEP] But we've been running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers. [SEP] Can you give us an idea of your plans to expand AmazonFresh into new markets?","5920":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith with ABC Capital Markets. [SEP] And then also, we're just supporting the global growth of the platform. [SEP] Can you provide any updates on your expansion plans into Asia?","5921":"We've continued to see strong growth in our market share over the past quarter, driven largely by our success in the B2B sector. Our team's relentless focus on meeting the needs of our corporate customers has enabled us to expand our reach significantly in this area. [SEP] We think that what we know, that if you look at the Fortune 500 as an example, we\u2019re in essentially all of the Fortune 500 companies. [SEP] Moving forward, we remain committed to pursuing strategic partnerships and investments that will allow us to maintain our position as a leader in the market. We believe that our extensive network and diverse range of services make us the ideal partner for businesses seeking to streamline and optimize their operations.","5922":"Can you give us some insight into how your products are evolving? [SEP] I mean the way that we kind of see the products now is we\u2019ve helped people map out and wire up their networks over the last several years, and now in each of these apps we have opportunities to help people get more value from the networks that they\u2019ve created in some of that is going to be on the social side, especially around creating communities and groups and some of it is going to be more on the economic and opportunity side and there we\u2019re doing a whole lot of projects. [SEP] That's great to hear. Can you tell us more about the economic and opportunity projects you're working on?","5923":"Now I'd like to turn to our music streaming service, Apple Music. We had great momentum going into the quarter and I'm pleased to say that it continued to accelerate. [SEP] Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50% as I'd mentioned earlier during the quarter, and so some really, really strong results. [SEP] We're thrilled with the growth we're seeing in this area of our business and we're constantly looking for ways to improve and innovate within the music streaming industry. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance this past quarter and are excited for what's to come.","5924":"We want to provide you with an update on our different business units. [SEP] Our Services business is very broad. [SEP] Within our Services business, we have several different segments that contribute to our overall success.","5925":"Our company has had a very successful quarter and I am pleased to report that we have seen significant growth in our revenue. [SEP] The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. [SEP] This impressive growth is a testament to the hard work of our team and our ongoing commitment to delivering innovative solutions to our customers.","5926":"The question I am frequently asked is whether our growth is reaching a saturation point. [SEP] And so I continue to believe, even though I\u2019ve seen people write that, that I think that theory is not correct, and do not see that. [SEP] Our data suggests that there is room for a lot more growth in our market.","5927":"Our sales and revenue have been impacted by various factors in the past quarter. However, we have successfully managed to offset some of the negative effects. [SEP] I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4. [SEP] Despite the anticipated headwind in Q4, we are confident in our ability to maintain our profitability and meet our financial targets for the year. We are exploring new opportunities and strategies to further enhance our business performance and provide value to our stakeholders.","5928":"Our team has been closely studying how user behavior differs between messaging platforms and news feeds. [SEP] It's that messaging can be a more transactional medium than feed. [SEP] As a result of these insights, we have decided to allocate more resources to our messaging features in the next quarter.","5929":"Our latest product innovation has been well-received by customers and is driving growth. [SEP] We're seeing strong adoption across a number of fronts. [SEP] As a result, we are confident in our ability to meet our revenue targets for the year.","5930":"Our company has seen a significant increase in demand for our product in recent months, and we've been working tirelessly to meet that demand. [SEP] They consume your whole attention while you're doing them. [SEP] However, we've also identified some areas where we can improve efficiency in our production processes. We're exploring new technologies and training programs to address those issues. \n\nStatement with context: Our company has seen a significant increase in demand for our product in recent months, and we've been working tirelessly to meet that demand. They consume your whole attention while you're doing them. However, we've also identified some areas where we can improve efficiency in our production processes. We're exploring new technologies and training programs to address those issues.","5931":"Can you talk a bit about how the shift to video content consumption has impacted advertising revenue?. [SEP] And then yes, I do think that there are less impressions when people are consuming video, so that also is a factor as more time is spent on videos. [SEP] However, we are seeing stronger engagement rates and higher click-through rates on our video ads, which is promising for our ad revenue growth in the future.","5932":"Looking back at Q1, there were a lot of positive indicators for our business. [SEP] But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments. [SEP] Overall, we're optimistic about the momentum we've built and the opportunities ahead as we enter the second half of the year.","5933":"Let's now move on to our user metrics. [SEP] One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year on all regions, and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters. [SEP] This is a strong indication that our product is resonating with users and that we are effectively executing on our growth strategy.","5934":"Our quarterly report showed impressive growth in revenue and strong performance in all of our business segments. [SEP] And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. [SEP] We expect these new services to drive even more growth and bring added value to our customers.","5935":"We've seen some strong growth in the past few quarters and are excited about our performance. [SEP] But right now, we're going to remain focused on user experience and the experimentation we're doing. [SEP] Of course, we'll still be keeping an eye on our bottom line, but we believe that investing in a great user experience is ultimately the key to long-term success.","5936":"Our revenue growth has largely been driven by our cloud services division. [SEP] It's by consumption of cloud capacity in many cases. [SEP] We've also seen a shift in customer demand towards more scalable and flexible cloud solutions, which has greatly benefited our business.","5937":"Our team has been exploring various avenues of growth to increase our market share and revenue. [SEP] But beyond that, we will look at inorganic means. [SEP] This could involve strategic partnerships, mergers, or acquisitions to accelerate our growth trajectory.","5938":"During this quarter, we saw significant growth in our cloud services division, particularly with Azure adoption. \n- Our team has been working diligently to improve our cost efficiency in both on-premise solutions and cloud offerings. [SEP] I think looking more pressured on gross margin just because the amount of Azure in the mix at the rate is growing, we\u2019re still not at that point where a $1 of gross margin in the cloud is equivalent to a $1 on-prem. [SEP] However, we recognize the increasing costs associated with cloud infrastructure and are continuing to evaluate our pricing strategy to ensure we are providing value to our customers while maintaining profitability. \n- As we further integrate Azure into our overall product portfolio, we expect to see continued growth in the cloud segment and improved margins over time.","5939":"Our revenue in the last quarter was down 10%. [SEP] Although when you\u2019re transitioning any business and all the hard work that we\u2019re doing here to prepare ourselves going forward, I do expect to see some volatility in that number. [SEP] However, I am confident that our investments in new product development and marketing will pay off in the long run.","5940":"Looking ahead to 2019, we have several exciting initiatives in the pipeline that we believe will drive growth and expand our market share. We have been investing heavily in research and development to bring innovative products to market and we are confident in their potential. [SEP] We expected a step up in 2019. [SEP] However, we are also mindful of potential headwinds in the market, including macroeconomic uncertainty and increasing competition. We will continue to closely monitor these factors and adjust our strategy as necessary to meet our financial goals and deliver value to our shareholders.","5941":"Our Services business has been one of the key drivers of growth for our company in recent years. [SEP] The biggest element and the part of the Services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, is the App Store. [SEP] We\u2019re seeing an increasing number of developers choosing to distribute their apps exclusively through the App Store, which is contributing to its continued success.","5942":"During the conference call, an investor asked about the company's stance on a recent political issue. [SEP] She made a pledge when she was elected that she would explain every vote she takes, and she explains every vote she takes on Facebook. [SEP] This level of transparency has been positively received by her constituents and has earned her a reputation as a trustworthy representative.","5943":"We're really excited about this new feature we're rolling out on our platform. [SEP] So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side. [SEP] And we've seen a lot of positive feedback from both buyers and sellers since its launch.","5944":"Can you speak to what sets your company apart in terms of innovation? [SEP] Perhaps one of the most unique things about at least our portfolio and our innovation is that we think that it\u2019s the mobility of the individual not the one device. [SEP] This mindset allows us to create products and services that seamlessly fit into people's lives, whether they're on the go or stationary.","5945":"Our sales team has been working hard to boost iPad sales, and we have seen some positive results. However, there have been concerns about the slowdown of iPad sales in the last quarter, and we wanted to address those concerns today. [SEP] And so I'm not predicting the 90-day clips and so forth, but over long arc of time I really believe that iPad is a great space, a great product and with -- also coupled with the product innovation we\u2019ve got, I think there is a very, very bright future for it. [SEP] We are also exploring new markets and opportunities to expand the iPad's reach. Additionally, we are constantly improving the product with new features and designs in response to customer feedback. We are confident that the iPad will continue to be a top performer for our company in the years to come.","5946":"Our digital services division has been a key driver of our company's overall revenue growth this quarter. [SEP] We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every geography. [SEP] This growth was fueled by several factors, including the success of several popular games and subscription-based apps.","5947":"Our new product has been well received by customers and we expect it to contribute significantly to our revenue growth in the coming quarters. [SEP] We have a very good track record overtime to reduce those cost structures, but every time we introduce a new product that is a headwind at the beginning of the cycle for gross margin. [SEP] However, we are confident that our cost reduction efforts combined with the increasing sales of this new product will eventually lead to improved gross margins as we move further into the product cycle.","5948":"We have been investing heavily in our artificial intelligence technology. [SEP] It's getting smarter and more capable. [SEP] This is allowing us to provide more personalized and efficient services to our customers.","5949":"We have a number of exciting developments to share regarding our cloud-based services and products. [SEP] For example, in FinServ, some very Tier 1 trading applications now using some of our capabilities in service fabric, which is really a PaaS service, which allows you to manage microservices with low latency and high scale, that's a place where we are seeing in fact activity, whether it's game development or trading applications. [SEP] Our team is continuing to explore new use cases for service fabric, particularly in the healthcare and logistics sectors.","5950":"During the quarter, we continued to invest in innovative marketing strategies to attract and retain customers. [SEP] Just to share one example, American Express working with Digitas, rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older. [SEP] As a result of this campaign, we saw a 5% increase in travel-related spending on American Express cards among the targeted age group.","5951":"We've had an incredible year at Apple, with record-breaking sales across all of our product categories. Our team has worked tirelessly to innovate and bring new products to market. [SEP] And so I sort of back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered and I know I never go anywhere without the Watch and it's not because I'm the CEO of Apple. [SEP] But what really sets Apple apart, in my opinion, is our commitment to the user experience. We don't just create products, we create experiences that people love and can't live without. That's why I believe the Apple Watch has been such a success - it's not just a device, it's a part of people's lives. And that's something we're incredibly proud of.","5952":"Our focus on innovation and growth continues to pay off as we announce strong earnings for the quarter. \n- Despite the challenging economic environment, we were able to see significant progress across all segments of our business. [SEP] Whether it's investment in ourselves, and the returns you've seen in this quarter in revenue growth, whether it's the acquisitions like LinkedIn that are performing better than we expected. [SEP] We remain committed to investing in opportunities that will drive long-term value for our shareholders, and we believe that our current momentum is a testament to the effectiveness of that strategy. \n- Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic and believe that our strong financial position and robust portfolio of offerings will allow us to weather any future challenges that may arise.","5953":"We have seen a lot of interest and engagement from our PIV customers since we launched this program last quarter. We wanted to share some insights with you today. [SEP] On the engagement of the Prime customers, excuse me PIV customers, we have seen buying habits that look like normal Prime customers or other Prime customers from the group that comes in through the digital pipelines, but we do also see a higher pickup in retention rates and free trial conversions. [SEP] This is encouraging for us as we continue to invest in this program and explore additional ways to engage this customer group. We believe there is a lot of potential here and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.","5954":"We are pleased to report our quarterly earnings results. [SEP] There are a lot of elements in the gross margin line that we have good control over and there are also elements that we don't control. [SEP] However, we are actively working to mitigate the impact of those elements outside of our control and remain confident in our overall financial performance.","5955":"We've been able to achieve some great results this quarter. [SEP] That's pretty unique again. [SEP] I think it really highlights the strength of our team and the innovative approach we're taking to the market.","5956":"Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current economic climate and the growth prospects for our company. We're pleased with the progress we made in the previous quarter, but we're also aware that there are some challenges that lie ahead. [SEP] And then in addition, in Q4, and over the longer term, we do continue to expect to face ad targeting related headwinds and uncertainties. [SEP] However, we're taking a proactive approach towards addressing these issues and are confident that we can navigate the current landscape successfully. Our strategy for the near term is focused on optimizing our operations, improving our customer experience, and continuing to invest in innovation.\" \n\n\"We're also exploring new avenues for growth, such as expanding into new markets and experimenting with different revenue models. These efforts will take time to bear fruit, but we believe they are necessary to ensure our long-term success.","5957":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing, the environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis. [SEP] Overall, we saw a 5% increase in revenue driven by strong sales in our core markets. However, we did feel the impact of foreign exchange rates on our earnings.","5958":"Can you tell us more about your product pipeline? [SEP] We are launching some now and everything we launch new products, we make them better. [SEP] Our focus is always on improving the customer experience and providing innovative solutions.","5959":"We have been working towards creating a more stable and sustainable monetization model for our platforms. [SEP] In terms of payments, we really see payments as primarily a way to enforce the other activities we want to see on Facebook and Instagram. [SEP] This means that we will be investing heavily in the infrastructure required to support our payments services.","5960":"We are pleased to announce that our Prime membership has continued to grow at a steady pace. Our efforts to expand our Prime offerings have been a key driver in this growth. [SEP] And as a step back, it builds stronger Prime connectivity with our Prime members, at least, the higher membership renewal rates and higher overall engagement. [SEP] This renewed engagement with our Prime members has also allowed us to better understand their needs and preferences, which we will use to continually improve our offerings. Overall, we are confident that our Prime program will continue to be a strong driver of growth and loyalty.","5961":"As we look back on the past year's sales performance and assess the data, we have decided to make some important strategic changes moving forward. [SEP] And so, Keith, the way that I think about it and I tried to outline it in my comments is that the significant revenue declines quarter over quarter through the year are a reflection of the focused approach we're going to take in phone sales. [SEP] While we may see some short-term revenue declines as a result of these changes, we believe they will ultimately lead to long-term success and growth for our company.","5962":"We have seen a significant increase in engagement on our platform in the past quarter. [SEP] In terms of video content, newsfeed is as interesting as the quality of the content in it. [SEP] Our team is constantly working on identifying high-quality video content that our users will find engaging and informative.","5963":"The next question comes from John from Goldman Sachs. John, over to you. [SEP] There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and we have extremely low share in that market overall. [SEP] Yes, thank you. We have been actively exploring strategies to penetrate that market and have made some progress in recent months. We have a highly talented team working on this and are optimistic about our future growth in this area.","5964":"Moving on to our product segments, I would like to highlight our performance in the quarter. [SEP] Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than even the overall company number. [SEP] This growth was driven by strong sales of our latest product line, as well as successful expansions into new markets.","5965":"We've seen tremendous growth in our international markets. [SEP] So we launched Prime in Australia; we're rolling devices out. [SEP] We're also continuing to invest in our fulfillment network to ensure fast and reliable delivery for Prime members in Australia.","5966":"Now let's open the line for some questions from our analysts. [SEP] The question on Services, when we look at our Services business, it's obviously growing very well across the board. [SEP] Can you provide any specific metrics or insights into what's driving this growth in Services?","5967":"We have been focusing on enhancing the online shopping experience for our customers. It is important that we provide them with a seamless shopping experience, from browsing to buying. [SEP] If we can help people check out and pay for the products and even buy the products, it makes the consumer experience better. [SEP] We have also introduced new payment options and streamlined our checkout process to ensure that the purchasing process is smooth and hassle-free. Our goal is to provide our customers with a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience, and we believe that improving the checkout process is a crucial step in achieving this. Our research shows that most customers abandon their carts due to complicated checkout processes, so by simplifying this, we are helping to reduce cart abandonment rates and boost our sales.","5968":"Now, turning to our sales figures for the quarter. [SEP] And keep in mind that that's down 5% on a comp a year ago that was up 81%. [SEP] So, we're still pleased with the performance overall, especially considering the challenging market conditions.","5969":"We are excited to announce the launch of our new Facebook tab for curated content.

Additionally, we offer repair services to prolong the lifespan of our products and encourage customers to recycle them at the end of their use.","5972":"We have seen a lot of growth in our advertising business in recent years. In fact, advertising now makes up over half of our total revenue. [SEP] When you think about mobile app install ads, those are an important but relatively small part of our revenue. [SEP] However, there are other areas of advertising that we see as having much greater potential for growth. One of these areas is programmatic advertising, which we believe will become an increasingly important part of the industry in the years to come. We are also investing heavily in new technology to make our advertising products even more effective for our clients.","5973":"Our quarterly earnings report shows a slight decrease in overall profits, primarily due to increased competition in the e-commerce market. [SEP] Its offset by the growth in the Prime program itself and the expansion of Prime Benefits or the Prime program globally. [SEP] We are confident that the continued growth and expansion of the Prime program will lead to increased revenue and a more secure financial future for our company.","5974":"Can you give us more detail on how you've been investing in your fulfillment centers and infrastructure?

[SEP] And surely even though not everyone comes to Facebook, because they want high quality news , I believe that there are going to be, whether it's 10% or 20% at a floor who I think would really want something like this. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to curate and publish content from reputable sources to ensure that our users have access to accurate and relevant news.","5976":"We've had a strong quarter for our services division, with several new partnerships and contracts. One trend that we've noticed is an increase in sales of bundled services packages that include both software and consulting services. This has had a positive impact on our gross margin for services. [SEP] Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because of the way we account for them. [SEP] However, we must also acknowledge that there are other factors at play, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, that can impact our margins. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver high-quality services that meet the needs of our customers while also driving profitable growth for our business.","5977":"Our cloud computing division has continued to perform exceptionally well this quarter. [SEP] And AWS revenue is on a, just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4. [SEP] We are confident that AWS will continue to be a significant driver of growth for our business moving forward.","5978":"Our revenue growth for the quarter has exceeded expectations. [SEP] so search is an area that we've been working on for a while to improve. [SEP] We are pleased to report that our efforts in search have paid off with a significant increase in user engagement and ad revenue.","5979":"Now, let's move to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] As you know, we gave our run rate at the end of last quarter at $4.4 billion and the course we\u2019ve said in our numbers have us on that continued trajectory as we hedge for Q [SEP] We are confident in our ability to maintain this level of growth and are excited about the potential for even further expansion in the coming quarters.","5980":"I'd like to now turn our attention to our financial performance over the last quarter. We are pleased to share that we achieved strong revenue growth, driven by several key factors. [SEP] And so that's what that means, and that number is the largest that we've ever recorded since we began measuring it three or so years ago. [SEP] We attribute this growth to our continued investment in product development and marketing efforts. Moving forward, we remain optimistic about our potential for sustained growth and profitability.","5981":"CEO: \"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our margins which have been a focus for us over the past few quarters.\"\n\nCFO: \"Yes, we've been putting a lot of effort into improving our margins and I'm happy to report that we've made some significant progress. [SEP] So the margin improvement on a lot over a period of time is something that we are absolutely going to see, but from quarter to quarter there will be more volatility, but I would ask our investor base to think more about the architecture as well as the financial outlays of what we're building. [SEP] CEO: \"We're investing heavily in new technology and infrastructure that we believe will position us well for future growth. While this will impact our short-term margins, we believe it's the right long-term strategy for the company.\"\n\nCFO: \"To add to what the CEO said, it's important for our investors to understand that we're not just focused on short-term gains, we're building something that will be sustainable for years to come.","5982":"We're excited to announce our expansion into new markets and the launch of new products.

We'll be partnering with local organizations to ensure our job creation efforts are equitable and inclusive.","5983":"Our revenue growth this quarter has been driven by a combination of factors, including a strong demand for our products and services, increased market share, and strategic partnerships. Speaking of partnerships, I want to touch on one in particular that has been a crucial part of our success. [SEP] They're still, again, great partners, have been and will continue to be for the future, but we see opportunities where we need to add additional capacity and we're filling those voids. [SEP] We're grateful for our partners' contributions to our business, but as we expand into new markets and invest in new technologies, we need to ensure we have the resources and capacity to meet the growing demand. Our investments will enable us to not only meet immediate needs but also position us for sustained growth in the long term. We're excited about the future and confident in our ability to seize these opportunities.","5984":"Our cloud adoption rates continue to exceed our expectations and we are seeing significant growth in all of our cloud offerings. [SEP] That's probably the best manifestation of the virtuous cycle that we see in any of the cloud adoption that we have, right. [SEP] We believe that the virtuous cycle will continue to drive our cloud business forward and help us capture even more market share.","5985":"One of our top priorities has always been customer satisfaction. [SEP] And so we're all about making sure the experience is great. [SEP] We've received phenomenal feedback from customers about the ease of use and seamless navigation on our website and app.","5986":"Now, moving on to our iPhone sales performance. [SEP] From an iPhone point of view, as I think Luca covered, our channel inventory decreased from the beginning of the quarter by 200,000 units, and that left us outside of our target range on the low -- outside the low end of the range to be specific. [SEP] However, we expect to make up for this shortfall in channel inventory in the next quarter and remain confident in the long-term growth potential of our iPhone business.","5987":"Our newest product, the XYZ app, has seen tremendous success in the market.

[SEP] We are confident that our continued investment in technological innovations like the XYZ app will drive sustained growth for our company in the long term.","5988":"We have been investing heavily in our supply chain infrastructure over the past year and a half. This has required significant financial resources, but we believe that it will ultimately create a more efficient and effective operation that can better meet the needs of our customers. [SEP] And so I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making. [SEP] Of course, this is just one aspect of our broader strategy. We are constantly looking for innovative ways to improve our operations and maintain a strong competitive position in the market. As always, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and customers alike.","5989":"We've seen tremendous growth in demand for our infrastructure server products over the past quarter. [SEP] And it turns out that the need for more computing, more storage and more infrastructure server products is much broader than just even the hyper scale public cloud because the one thing that is true is there are more devices in that unit backend. [SEP] As we move into the next quarter, we are confident that this trend will only continue as more and more companies look to upgrade their computing and storage capacities.","5990":"We're excited about the new product launch in Q4 and the potential it has for increasing revenue.

[SEP] This will not only improve our visibility but also help us to showcase our products to a wider audience.","5993":"We did a deep dive into user behavior across our platforms. [SEP] And some of what we found is that as we encourage people to use both Facebook and Instagram, engagement on both can increase. [SEP] This has led us to invest further in cross-promoting content between the two apps.","5994":"Looking at our Q2 results, we are pleased to report growth across all of our divisions. Our PC sales in particular saw strong performance. [SEP] And particularly in developed markets, the PC growth was better than we thought.

Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business.","5995":"I'd like to provide an update on the performance of our new tab feature. [SEP] I don't think we have any new status to share on this, but I mean overall we rolled out the tab for -- almost the first year we were really tuning it just to make sure that it would be retentive and very valuable for people. [SEP] We've seen a steady increase in user engagement and are confident in the value it's providing to our users.","5996":"Our Messenger platform continues to experience strong growth, with billions of messages being sent every day.

We are pleased to report strong growth in this area. [SEP] The strength of our Services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September.

[SEP] Our streaming platform has also seen a significant increase in active users, with a 25% growth in the past quarter alone.","6003":"We've been closely monitoring changes in the advertising landscape and their impact on our clients' campaigns.

Thank you all for your time and your continued support.","6006":"Our Q3 revenue increased by 3% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew one. [SEP] This growth can be attributed to our continued focus on expanding our customer base and increasing market share.","6007":"Our focus for the coming year is really on placing the customer at the center of everything we do. It's not just about creating the next big product, but about understanding what our customers truly need. [SEP] And we really want to speak to the needs of the customers more than any product strategy goal we have. [SEP] That's why we've invested heavily in customer research and feedback loops. We're constantly listening to our customers' pain points and concerns, and using that information to inform our strategic decisions. At the end of the day, if we can't meet their needs and exceed their expectations, then we're not truly succeeding as a company.","6008":"During this quarter, we have seen some excellent performance from our sales team, who have been working tirelessly to acquire new customers and retain existing ones. As a result, we have achieved a significant increase in revenue, surpassing our own expectations. [SEP] But again in your question on enterprise penetration, you know I think the enterprise, we\u2019re making great progress there.

[SEP] However, we did notice some impact on sales of our older models.","6011":"Can you give us any insight into your growth expectations for the coming year? [SEP] The comparable I'll give you is that I won't forecast 2017, but the 20% growth in square footage that we saw in 2015 was followed by 30% square footage increase in 2016. [SEP] So, should we expect another significant increase in square footage for 2017?","6012":"We understand that there may be concerns about the impact of our recent pricing changes on our customers. [SEP] But at the end of the day, we make our decisions from a financial standpoint to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars, and that we think is the focus that is in the best interest of our investors. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our strategy and believe it will ultimately lead to long-term growth and profitability for our company.","6013":"When our product first launched in 2015, it had a slow start. [SEP] It only had about 30 million people using it at the time. [SEP] Fast forward to today, we have over 500 million active users on our platform.","6014":"Now let's turn to our human resources. [SEP] Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. [SEP] We have continued to prioritize investing in our team members and building out our talent pipeline.","6015":"We are thrilled to report that our Pages product was a huge success this quarter.

[SEP] We have recently released new mobile ad formats that have been well-received by our clients and have seen a positive impact on engagement and click-through rates.","6019":"Our team has been working hard to improve our ad targeting capabilities.

[SEP] As a result, we have invested heavily in our e-commerce platform to meet the increasing demand for online shopping.","6022":"We have seen increasing interest in our messaging platforms, namely WhatsApp and Messenger, from businesses looking to advertise and engage with their customers. [SEP] As you can complete more payments in WhatsApp and Messenger, you would expect it to be worth more for businesses to bid more there, which is why we're so far focused on making it so that the payments can be free or really as cheap as possible. [SEP] Additionally, we are exploring ways to integrate payment processing directly into the messaging experience, allowing for more convenient and seamless transactions. Our goal is to create a holistic commerce ecosystem within our platforms, benefitting both businesses and consumers.","6023":"We've seen continued growth and usage in our messaging platforms, with WhatsApp reaching over 2 billion users and Messenger seeing increased engagement during the pandemic. As we continue to invest in these platforms, our focus remains on privacy and security for our users. [SEP] And I think if there's an opportunity to use the work that we've done with WhatsApp there, rather than doing it in different ways in the different messaging experiences, to have that really just - to have encryption work in a consistent way across the different things that we're doing. [SEP] Additionally, we're exploring ways to integrate merchant services into our messaging platforms, allowing users to easily make purchases and transactions within the app. By maintaining strong encryption standards across all of our products, we can ensure that these transactions are secure and protected. We're excited about the potential of these developments and look forward to sharing more updates in the future.","6024":"Our revenue growth in Q1 has been strong, largely driven by increased demand for our products in the Chinese market. [SEP] And the one that I got much visibility in -- that happened in early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%, so it's a very aggressive move. [SEP] We anticipate that the VAT reduction will have a positive impact on our sales in the coming quarters, as it will make our products more affordable and attractive to Chinese consumers.","6025":"We've had some challenges this quarter with supply chain disruptions and inflation in certain categories, but overall our company is still performing well.

[SEP] We've also seen positive results from our initial tests of the new privacy features, which give users more control over their data.","6028":"One of the challenges we faced during this quarter was the sudden increase in competition. We had to analyze the market and come up with strategies to differentiate ourselves. [SEP] They\u2019re part of business, and so we\u2019re dealing with them in many ways. [SEP] Our marketing team has been working tirelessly to promote our brand and reach more customers. We're also considering expanding our product line to diversify our revenue streams.

[SEP] Thank you for your thoughts on balancing virtual and physical experiences in a way that benefits society as a whole.","6031":"We've seen some changes in the market that have affected our revenue streams. [SEP] So you're seeing some of those get spread across several different lines in the P&L, so it's not going to be a clean one spot where you're going to find it. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to navigate these changes and continue to grow our business.","6032":"As far as our company's performance in the second quarter is concerned...

We are confident that our increased fulfillment capacity will allow us to continue providing top-notch service to our sellers and customers alike.","6042":"During the last quarter, we've seen a significant increase in video usage across all of our platforms. To capitalize on this trend, we've been investing heavily in our video capabilities and experimenting with new ways to make video creation and consumption even easier for our users. [SEP] And one of the big themes that we're talking about here is becoming video first, right, and as people look for richer and richer ways to express themselves just like people in the past just shared a lot of text and photos on Facebook, we think that in the future more of that is going to be video. [SEP] To support this shift towards video-first content, we're also exploring new advertising formats and partnerships that will allow us to better monetize video content. We believe that video will be a key driver of our long-term growth and remain committed to expanding our video capabilities even further in the years ahead.","6043":"We're pleased to report strong revenue growth for the quarter.

Overall, we're thrilled with our performance this quarter.","6045":"We are seeing some changes in our product mix, particularly on the higher-end models. [SEP] And also this channel inventory reduction that we've talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs.

[SEP] By going serverless, we are able to reduce our operational costs and improve the scalability and flexibility of our applications.","6069":"We have seen significant growth in our third-party seller business over the past quarter. [SEP] Brian touched on the success that our FDA sellers had with Prime Day, but we see FBA as a tailwind for third-party business in general.

[SEP] We also don't have all of our advertisers yet creating story ads. [SEP] However, we are confident that as more advertisers see the value and engagement potential of this feature, we will see an increase in those utilizing it.","6072":"We are always keeping an eye on the latest technology trends and consumer preferences. [SEP] But also recently, one of the things that we've seen is that there are a lot of AR experiences on mobile. [SEP] As a result, we have been exploring ways to incorporate AR into our own mobile offerings in order to stay ahead of the curve.","6073":"Can you speak to the deceleration in unit growth that we saw this quarter? [SEP] And on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation, because it doesn't include the -- some of our fastest growing areas, the things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number. [SEP] So, could you give us a better sense of how those areas are performing and how they may be contributing to overall revenue growth? And do you anticipate these areas continuing to be significant drivers of growth in the coming quarters?","6074":"We've identified several key areas where we can improve our performance. [SEP] There are really, when you think about it, three. [SEP] So let's start with the first area, which is our supply chain.\" \n\n\"There are really, when you think about it, three areas we need to focus on: product innovation, cost control, and customer experience.","6075":"Can you provide some insight into your overall strategy moving forward? [SEP] So for a while, our strategy has been to just continue building as good tools as we can because no matter how many people we have on the team, we're never going to be able to look at everything. [SEP] And can you speak to any specific tools or developments that you're particularly proud of?\"\n\n\"As we continue to grow and expand our capabilities, we're mindful of the fact that our team can only do so much. By investing in top-of-the-line tools and technology, we're able to more effectively analyze data and monitor trends across a range of markets and industries. This approach has served us well thus far, and we remain committed to staying at the forefront of innovation in all that we do.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, success in this industry depends on the ability to stay ahead of the curve. By leveraging the latest tools and technologies available to us, we're confident that we can continue to provide our clients with the highest quality insights and recommendations possible.","6076":"As we wrap up this earnings call, I'd like to turn the discussion to our performance in the fourth quarter.

[SEP] Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic about the state of the market and our ability to continue delivering strong results.","6077":"Our focus in the last year has been on building our streaming capabilities. [SEP] And the advantage we have with streaming is, we have a massive cloud advantage. [SEP] This has allowed us to scale rapidly and efficiently, which gives us a clear advantage over our competitors.","6078":"Moving on to our Asia-Pacific market, I'd like to discuss the growth potential in China. [SEP] The latest study I have seen from Mackenzie indicates if you look back five years China\u2019s middle class had about 50 million people in it. [SEP] But by the end of 2020, that number had quadrupled to 200 million, which presents a significant opportunity for us.","6079":"We've noticed some shifts in consumer behavior and we're working to address them. [SEP] So we're very focused on this. [SEP] We're confident that our efforts will pay off and we'll see positive results in the upcoming quarter.","6080":"We noticed a decrease in our marketing expenses this quarter.

[SEP] As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. [SEP] We saw strong growth in both foot traffic and online orders, particularly in key markets like Shanghai and Beijing.","6082":"We've seen a steady increase in demand for our premium products over the past year. [SEP] I don't really think about there being sort of a cap on that when you think about the mix percentage [SEP] As long as there is consumer demand and we continue to innovate and improve our offerings, I believe the mix percentage will continue to grow and remain a significant portion of our overall revenue.","6083":"We've seen some changes in our revenue streams over the past quarter. [SEP] Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription.

[SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making on our various initiatives aimed at expanding internet access and enhancing the experiences of users around the world.","6085":"We've received some criticism regarding our policies for moderating content on our platform. We understand that there is a delicate balance between allowing free expression and protecting users from harmful content. [SEP] So we feel a responsibility to have policies for our community which limit hate speech and limit things which are going to create just an overwhelmingly uncomfortable environment for people that is going to silence other people's speech in order to make sure that over the long-term we are enabling the most people to be able to express as much as possible as they can. [SEP] At the same time, we recognize that our policies have the potential to impact our bottom line. We are constantly evaluating our policies and making adjustments where necessary to ensure that we are creating a safe and welcoming environment for all users while also remaining profitable.","6086":"Moving on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] So, we are looking at a 400 basis point impact from foreign exchange for the March quarter. [SEP] However, despite this impact, we were able to maintain steady revenue growth thanks to strong performance in our domestic markets.","6087":"We are thrilled to announce that our company has achieved a major milestone in our long-term strategy. [SEP] That's a multiyear and a generational transformation. [SEP] We are confident that this transformation will position us as a leader in our industry for years to come.","6088":"Thank you for your questions.

[SEP] We're excited about the potential of this offering and we'll continue to explore opportunities in the advertising and video space.","6089":"We believe that small businesses are the backbone of economies all around the world. [SEP] That's why there are 45 million SMB pages on Facebook. [SEP] Our mission is to help these businesses connect with their customers and grow their business.","6090":"We have time for one more question. [SEP] On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. [SEP] Additionally, we are constantly evaluating our pricing strategy and options to make Prime accessible to as many customers as possible.","6091":"Our research and development team has been working hard to innovate new products and services that meet the evolving needs of our customers.

[SEP] Our strategy moving forward is to continue investing in the development and enhancement of our Dynamics 365 platform, while also expanding our portfolio of cloud-based offerings to better serve the evolving needs of our customers.","6096":"We have noticed a shift in our clients' approach to technology. [SEP] It's no longer just simple vendor relationships, because as they are trying to build their own software capability, they need a trusted partner who's more interested in making sure that they build their own technology capability. [SEP] We believe that our expertise and experience in developing tech solutions makes us an ideal partner for our clients.","6097":"Our profits for the last year were exceptional due to our successful launch of a new product line and the unexpected increase in demand.

[SEP] However, we still anticipate healthy growth in revenue and profitability for this year, as we continue to expand our product offerings and enter new markets. We are confident in our ability to maintain our competitive edge and deliver value to our shareholders.","6098":"Can you discuss the key strengths of our platform and how they differentiate us from our competitors?

[SEP] How do you plan to continue to leverage these advantages to stay ahead of the curve in the industry?","6099":"Our fiscal quarter has been a strong one, with notable growth across all of our product lines. [SEP] Now looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive. [SEP] As we move into the next quarter, we are optimistic about our continued success and the launch of several new products.","6100":"We have seen a significant increase in sales of our latest smartphone model. [SEP] But if you compare to iPhone 6, you would clearly arrive at the opposite conclusion. [SEP] Our market research shows that customers are particularly drawn to the larger screen size and improved camera quality.","6101":"We've received a lot of questions about our virtual reality division and where we see it heading. [SEP] But I think one of the things to recognize here is that we're still early with Oculus. [SEP] We believe that virtual reality is a huge opportunity for us and we're committed to investing in it for the long-term.","6102":"We've seen tremendous success in our recent product launches.

[SEP] When we think about bookings growth, I'm not sure -- for me -- break it down into two pieces, which is I think about bookings which were very good this quarter, has two fundamental motions. [SEP] First, there was strong demand for our products and services across all regions and customer segments. Additionally, we executed a successful marketing campaign which drove increased interest and conversions.","6107":"Thank you for joining us today for our quarterly earnings conference call. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter with revenue growth exceeding expectations.

We remain focused on providing the best solutions and support to our customers.","6108":"We have been exploring different ways to diversify our content offerings and engage with our audience on different platforms.

However, we recognize that currency exchange rates can have a substantial impact on our financial performance, so we've taken steps to minimize our exposure to fluctuations whenever possible. [SEP] Keep in mind, there are some currencies around the world that where we cannot economically hedge and so those currencies are bit excluded from what we're talking about right now. [SEP] Of course, we're still closely monitoring all of our international operations, even those that are not directly hedged against currency risks. We believe that our diverse range of products and services will continue to generate strong returns across most currencies in the long run. As always, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders while minimizing our risks and maximizing our opportunities for growth.","6110":"Our company has been expanding our operations over the past year, and we are excited about the potential for growth in the near future.

[SEP] We will be investing heavily in these areas over the next quarter to ensure that we see continued progress and success.","6111":"Can you speak to any improvements in efficiency or productivity within the company over the past quarter? [SEP] If anything, I think our cycle times have significantly come down. [SEP] That's great to hear. Can you provide any specific examples of where you've seen the most significant improvements in cycle times?","6112":"Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our long-term strategy for growth. [SEP] So at a fundamental long-term secular basis, we have new growth, new workloads, and that's what we are focused on, and that's a much bigger addressable market than anything our Transactional Server business had in the past. [SEP] We're excited about the opportunities ahead and are confident that our focus on these new workloads will continue to drive strong performance for our business.","6113":"We have invested heavily in research and development, and it's paying off. Our team is dedicated to finding solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. [SEP] We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't.

We're excited to build on this momentum and keep pushing forward.","6114":"Our focus on developer productivity has been a key driver of our success over the years. We've always believed that the more efficient we are at creating tools for developers, the more value we can deliver to our customers and ultimately, the more successful our business can become. [SEP] It's an end on to its own, which is, we've always cared about developer and developer productivity and especially at a time like this when there are more developers outside of the tech industry as the world goes digital. [SEP] As we look ahead, we remain committed to investing in technology that empowers developers to create amazing things. This is a critical part of who we are as a company and it speaks to our culture of innovation and continuous improvement. We believe that by putting developers first, we can continue to be a leader in our industry and make a positive impact on the world.","6115":"Now, let's discuss the effects of our hedging program. [SEP] The impact without hedges would be higher. [SEP] However, due to our strategic hedging efforts, we were able to mitigate the potential losses.","6116":"Now, let's move on to discussing our server products and services.

[SEP] Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. [SEP] We attribute the success of our advertising revenue to our innovative advertising solutions and increased user engagement on our platform.","6118":"During the quarter, we've seen significant growth across our messaging and communication platforms. [SEP] One of the things that had been interesting, while we were watching these different services grow, was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services were growing at the same time, and it seemed a little bit counter-intuitive at first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it actually, now in retrospect looking back, seems like there is. [SEP] This has led us to explore new opportunities for integration and cross-promotion between these services, which we believe will further accelerate growth and engagement.","6119":"Our international expansion strategy is a key focus for us this year. [SEP] We talked about opening, announcing the region in India so there's expansion there as well. [SEP] Additionally, we have identified several other regions where we believe there is potential for significant growth.","6120":"Moving on to our Intelligent Cloud and intelligent edge infrastructure. This is an area that has continued to grow rapidly for us. [SEP] because at the scale at which we operate, the Intelligent Cloud and the intelligent edge infrastructure, which you all track as Azure, you got to remember it's the core platform that's powering everything from our gaming ambitions to what we are doing with Microsoft 365, to what we are doing with Dynamics 365 and of course, our third-party business in Azure. [SEP] And we're really just scratching the surface of what's possible with Azure. We believe the platform has even more potential to unlock game-changing innovations and drive growth across our entire business. So, we're really excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to continuing to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.","6121":"As we look to expand into new markets, we are closely monitoring the regulatory landscape in each country. [SEP] I think we\u2019ll see different paces of people doing things in different countries around the world, but a lot of what we hope that we can \u2013 that we can contribute to this discussion is as much as possible have shared frameworks for how the industry should operate around the world. During the call, the CEO was discussing the company's global expansion plans. [SEP] We believe that by establishing these shared frameworks, we can create consistency and efficiency in our operations across borders.","6122":"We have received inquiries from shareholders regarding our plans for returning value to them. [SEP] But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons we see a lot of value in the stock. [SEP] Therefore, at this time, we have decided to prioritize share buybacks over dividends.","6123":"We have seen a tremendous growth in our intelligent cloud business in the last quarter. [SEP] Heather, let me -- on gross margin, over a long-term period and intelligent cloud, given the expansive TAM and the growth opportunity we see, it will create gross margin pressure over long-term. [SEP] However, we believe that by investing in technology and innovation, we can offset this pressure and maintain a healthy gross margin over time.","6124":"Can you give us some insight into which verticals are driving the most revenue growth for your company? [SEP] You have our top verticals correct, and we see a lot of strong growth in those verticals. [SEP] Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our verticals and we plan to continue investing in those areas to ensure continued growth.","6125":"Our financial results for the quarter have been very encouraging, especially in the North American and International markets. We are pleased to report growth in both of these regions. [SEP] North America was up 200 basis points sequentially and International was up 800 basis points and half of that you remember we've spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was instituted last \u2013 April 1 of [SEP] Despite the challenges we faced with the Japanese consumption tax, we were able to successfully navigate the situation and deliver strong results. Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about our future prospects and are committed to continuing to deliver value to our shareholders.","6126":"Now turning to our emerging market segment. [SEP] And so very happy with the trajectory we're on there and excited to be investing and have the opportunities we do at that point. [SEP] Moving on to our North American operations...","6127":"We're really excited about the potential of our new technology. It's a game-changer for the industry and we believe it's going to take us to the next level. [SEP] So if you look at what the initial use cases are going to be around that, I think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people talking about. [SEP] We're working closely with our partners to identify the most promising use cases for the technology, and we're confident that we're on the right track. Ultimately, we believe that this new innovation is going to help us achieve a level of growth and success that we've never seen before.","6128":"Now moving on to our financial position... [SEP] And you know, of course we\u2019ve got a very, very strong balance sheet. [SEP] So we have the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and return capital to shareholders as we see fit.","6129":"During the quarter, we implemented several initiatives to improve engagement on our platform. [SEP] We thought that helping people interact more was the unique thing that people come to our services for and that it would be good for the community and the business over the long term. [SEP] As a result, we have seen an increase in user activity and higher levels of customer satisfaction.","6130":"We're always looking for ways to invest in the business to drive future growth. [SEP] So those are important investments from an ROI perspective, but they don't have, obviously, immediate translation into revenue dollars. [SEP] However, we firmly believe these investments will pay off in the long run as we continue to position ourselves for success in the market.","6131":"We have been investing heavily in our technology and platforms to make sure that we can provide tailored solutions that meet the needs of each individual customer. This has required us to be able to handle a lot of different types of data and to be able to respond quickly to changes in the market. [SEP] So I would say we are well equipped to deal with that complexity and the variability of what our customers want us to be helping them with. [SEP] Of course, there will always be challenges and new developments that we need to stay on top of. However, we have a highly skilled and knowledgeable team who are dedicated to finding the best solutions for our customers. We are confident that we can continue to adapt and thrive in this complex and ever-changing landscape.","6132":"Our revenue for this quarter has increased by 20% compared to the same quarter last year. We attribute this growth to our continued investment in research and development. [SEP] And then of course, there's some deeper AI research that we're doing that feeds into those applications as well. [SEP] We're excited to see the impact these advancements will have on our products and services, and we believe it will differentiate us from our competitors in the long run. We remain committed to investing in AI and leveraging its capabilities to improve the experience of our customers.","6133":"Moving on to our North America segment...

Our advertising team has been proactive in developing strategies to optimize ad loads and inventory.

[SEP] Our efforts to drive relevancy have led to positive feedback from our customers, and we have seen an increase in engagement with our served ads. As we continue to refine our ad strategy, we are also exploring new advertising formats to keep things fresh and engaging for our audience.

[SEP] So we're within that period at this moment, and you can see for all of us that travel there so much, with every trip you can see this occurring. [SEP] How do you see this trend evolving over the next few quarters?","6139":"We have seen some changes in regulations regarding data privacy and usage that could potentially impact our business. [SEP] Any change of the ability for us and our advertisers to use data can impact our optimization potential at the margin, which could impact our ability to drive price improvements in the long run. [SEP] However, we are constantly monitoring these changes and adapting our strategies to ensure we can continue to deliver value to our advertisers and drive growth for our company.","6140":"Thank you for that question. [SEP] We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and services, not only to allow sellers to sell, but to help themselves more successfully. [SEP] It's really important for us to invest in our sellers and their success as it ultimately leads to more satisfied customers and a stronger business overall.","6141":"Question from an analyst: Can you talk about the impact that Instagram has had on your advertising revenue? We\u2019ve heard some advertisers express concern about rising costs and the effectiveness of the platform.\n\nResponse from the company executive: Of course. Instagram is a critical platform for us and we continue to see strong demand from advertisers. However, we understand that there may be some concerns about costs and ROI, particularly given the recent changes in user behavior and the competitive landscape. [SEP] On the Instagram question, certainly in the short-run, some of the spend is incremental and some of it isn\u2019t. [SEP] But overall, we feel very confident about the long-term prospects for advertising on Instagram. We\u2019re constantly iterating and refining our targeting capabilities to ensure that advertisers are seeing great results regardless of the size of their budget.

In fact, our commercial cloud revenue for the quarter was $13.3 billion, up 31% year over year. [SEP] Just because if you take something like Enterprise Mobility Suite, that gives you an indication of how, for example, we attach to Office 365 essentially an infrastructure service that has SaaS-like margins, or even some of our application services in Azure that attach to Office developer experiences. [SEP] And we're just scratching the surface of the potential for growth in these areas. Our focus on providing integrated, end-to-end solutions for our customers means that we can continue to drive adoption and revenue growth across our entire cloud portfolio. We're excited about the opportunities ahead and confident in our ability to capture them.","6143":"Our focus for the past quarter has been on driving growth in our core verticals.

As you may know, we have been in a legal battle with Qualcomm over licensing fees for some time now. We believe that Qualcomm is charging us unfairly high royalty rates for their technology. [SEP] The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. [SEP] We strongly disagree with this approach and believe it is not only unfair to Apple but to the entire industry. It is also important to note that Qualcomm's licensing practices are under investigation by several antitrust agencies around the world. We are confident that we will prevail in this legal dispute and we will continue to fight for fair and reasonable licensing fees for our technology partners and ourselves.","6188":"Now, I'd like to turn our attention to some of the other products within our portfolio. [SEP] If you look at the other products category and look at the revenue in this category, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year over year change and assume that were the total Watch revenue [SEP] Just keep in mind that this category includes a variety of products, not just the Apple Watch, so it's important to look at the individual numbers to truly understand our performance.","6189":"Our cash reserves have continued to grow steadily over the past year.

That's why we're so committed to our strategic goals. [SEP] And so from that perspective I feel good about leading because that's one of our strategic goals, which is we want to create new categories, foster more demand for the entire ecosystem. [SEP] We have a lot of exciting new products in the pipeline, and we're confident that they will help us create those new categories and drive demand for our ecosystem. At the same time, we remain focused on providing the best possible experience for our existing customers, because we know that their satisfaction is the key to our long-term success.","6225":"Now turning to our user metrics. [SEP] And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. [SEP] This is due to the fact that we have been investing heavily in user acquisition and engagement initiatives, and we are seeing strong results in terms of increased usage and retention.","6226":"Thank you for that question. We appreciate your interest in our company. [SEP] And on each of these, I think that there is work that we can do and that we certainly have a responsibility to really make sure that we perform well on them. [SEP] We will be continually monitoring our progress and making necessary adjustments to ensure we meet or exceed our targets.","6227":"Our company has been heavily investing in new technology to stay ahead of the game. [SEP] Of course, we have an amazing cloud with the SaaS services for IoT, but the edge compute, the ability to run a neural network at the edge, do inferences at the edge is exciting. [SEP] We believe this edge computing technology will be the next big thing in the industry, and we are excited to be one of the first to offer it to our customers.","6228":"Our Q2 financial results show strong growth in both revenues and net income. We are pleased to report that our strategies for revenue expansion and cost management have paid off. [SEP] Both sequentially and year-over-year.

[SEP] P is now up to 53% of total paid units. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue as we further invest in our partnerships with third-party sellers.","6231":"Now that we have discussed the challenges we faced in the last quarter, let's move on to our forecast for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] Having said all that, we have provided what we believe is very strong guidance for the March quarter. [SEP] We have a solid pipeline of products and are confident in our ability to drive growth in the coming months.","6232":"Based on our analysis of the current economic environment, we have been closely reviewing our purchasing decisions. [SEP] We have decided to make some purchasing decision, given current market conditions, and that should unwind over time. [SEP] We anticipate that these decisions will have a positive impact on our bottom line in the coming quarters.","6233":"We've had some questions from investors regarding how our unit sales have impacted our financial performance over the past few years. [SEP] If you look at our revenue, given the last three years, if you look at our net income during the last three years, if you look at our stock price here in the last three years, there's no correlation to the units sold in any given period. [SEP] We believe this is due to a variety of factors, including changes in pricing, fluctuations in demand from different markets, and investments we've made in new products and technologies. However, we are constantly working to find ways to improve our unit sales and maintain the strong financial position we've achieved.","6234":"Moving on to our e-commerce segment, let's talk about how our FBA services performed this quarter. [SEP] So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services.

[SEP] It's a huge thing and it's a big area that we can develop going forward. [SEP] We have already allocated a significant amount of resources towards expanding our digital offerings and I am confident that this will continue to be a major source of revenue for us in the years to come.","6237":"One of our long-term goals as a company is to ensure that everyone has equal access to an open and secure internet. [SEP] And I mean, we're working with folks to enable that but I think that, that would be good for people everywhere to make sure that basically every person who uses an Internet service has the same protections no matter where they live. [SEP] We believe that by advocating for these protections, we can improve the online experience for everyone and promote a more equitable society.","6238":"We have made significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) over the past few years. [SEP] Those are things that will play out \u2013 AI in the near-term, but the investments in AR and VR are really about building the next generation of computing, and that's got a longer-term return window. [SEP] We believe that these new computing technologies will create entirely new markets and be a major driving force behind the next wave of innovation in our industry.","6239":"When it comes to mobile advertising, we believe there are a plethora of options available. [SEP] Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms out there. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a significant ROI from our advertising spend on both Facebook and Instagram.","6240":"Our sales figures have been strong this quarter, but we're always looking for more meaningful metrics to evaluate our performance. [SEP] And the way that we really look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell-through. [SEP] We've seen sell-through increase steadily over the past few months, indicating that customers are interested in our products and returning for repeat purchases.","6241":"We have seen significant growth in our advertising revenue in the past quarter, driven by our increased ability to deliver personalized and relevant ads to our users. However, we recognize that there is still room for improvement in this area. [SEP] And this has been a theme for our ad strategy and product development for more than a year now, maybe two years, where folks have consistently asked us what we're going to do to increase the amount of ads that we're showing. [SEP] While we understand the importance of advertising revenue to our business, we also prioritize the user experience and maintaining their trust. Therefore, we have been focused on finding ways to increase ad revenue without compromising on the quality of our user experience. We remain committed to this strategy and will continue to seek out new opportunities for growth while keeping our users top of mind.","6242":"Our Prime subscriber base has continued to grow at a strong pace both domestically and internationally. We are seeing particularly strong growth in Europe and Japan. [SEP] As we may have mentioned in the past, we feel that Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally. [SEP] We attribute this growth to our focus on expanding our Prime benefits and enhancing the overall customer experience.

[SEP] If you look at the efficiency or the -- first the cost, they generally fall into a few buckets. [SEP] One major factor driving up costs has been the increased production volume in our manufacturing facilities.","6245":"During the quarter, we saw some challenges in certain regions. [SEP] These are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent period. [SEP] However, our team has been proactive in managing these challenges and navigating through the volatility. We remain optimistic for the long-term growth potential of these markets.","6246":"Our second quarter earnings demonstrate the strength and resilience of our company. Despite challenging market conditions, our team executed well and delivered solid results. [SEP] And as I mentioned before, in emerging markets, we did extremely well.

Overall, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our ability to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.","6247":"We have been working hard on expanding our Prime membership benefits and we have some exciting updates to share. [SEP] We think it's an interesting part of the selection offer for Prime and it's, in many ways, something that we can do that others can't [SEP] Our internal data shows that customers who take advantage of this benefit are more likely to renew their Prime membership and spend more on our platform.","6248":"We have some exciting updates to share with everyone on our News Feed and tab strategy for the coming year. [SEP] So the biggest change that I think that we're going to see on the consumption in News Feed and in the tab over the next year or two is going to be much more video inventory and content coming in as we work through and make that business model start to really click for a lot of folks. [SEP] This shift towards video content will provide new opportunities for advertisers to reach their target audiences in more creative and engaging ways.","6249":"We're closely monitoring the situation, but at this time, we don't see any significant changes in the market. [SEP] So I wouldn't expect any material impact. [SEP] However, we will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our strategies accordingly if needed. We want to ensure we're prepared for any potential impact on our business.","6250":"We've seen some changes in the market that have impacted our revenue streams. [SEP] But I think, in general, the goal is to have -- and continue to build on that business, but certainly, that would be where the \"volatility\" would show up. [SEP] We're hopeful that our strategies for diversification will mitigate any potential bumps in the road.","6251":"Thank you all for joining us today for our quarterly earnings conference call. [SEP] is a big year. [SEP] We have many exciting initiatives and projects in the pipeline that we are confident will continue to drive strong growth for the company.","6252":"Thank you for the question. [SEP] Let me talk about this in two or even a couple of components [SEP] Firstly, I want to address our revenue growth in the past quarter, and then discuss our investment strategy moving forward.","6253":"Our goal this quarter was to improve customer onboarding and retention. We recognized that many customers were experiencing difficulty navigating our platform and that this was negatively impacting their engagement with our product. [SEP] and so we've designed a program that made it simple and easy to do that. [SEP] As a result of these efforts, we've seen a 25% increase in customer retention and a 15% increase in active usage. We're thrilled with these results and plan to continue iterating on our onboarding program to further improve the customer experience.","6254":"We've seen some interesting changes in the market lately.

So we're watching the developments on that closely.

[SEP] In addition to advertising, we are also exploring partnerships and collaborations with other companies in the industry. We are confident that our investments in technology and talent will continue to drive growth in the years to come. Thank you for your time and attention.","6257":"During the earnings call, the CEO was asked about the impact of Office 365 on productivity within the company. [SEP] But if I think about all the tools that I\u2019m using, which is all part of Office 365, today, on a daily basis and multiple times a day I start my day as I talked about in many conferences with Dell which is a tool I love which is in fact something that\u2019s uniquely possible because of the shift to Office 365 where we can take organizational data and breakthrough all the boundaries or, again, in silos inside an organization and have people discover information.

The speed of light gets in the way of transmitting data over long distances without signal loss. We are currently exploring solutions to minimize this effect and improve the overall performance of our fiber optic network.","6260":"Now, let's discuss our revenue breakdown by geography. [SEP] FX on a sequential basis is fairly muted, so we're not seeing any significant fluctuations in our international revenue. [SEP] However, we are keeping a close eye on currency volatility in emerging markets.","6261":"We've seen a significant increase in our revenue this quarter. [SEP] That's the primary driver. [SEP] We will continue to focus on this area of our business to ensure continued growth and success in the future.","6262":"We've had some really good conversations with our customers over the past few weeks and one thing that's become clear is that they're looking for more flexibility in terms of their cloud services. [SEP] And I think it makes in fact our cloud more attractive to many of them because of that. [SEP] Overall, we feel really good about the direction we're headed in and we believe that offering more customization options will continue to set us apart from our competitors.","6263":"Our strategy for the future of our messaging apps has been a key topic of discussion among our team for some time now. We have been analyzing trends and researching the market to determine the most effective approach. [SEP] So the playbook that we're going to run with Messenger and WhatsApp is kind of similar to how we thought about building a business in Facebook and News Feed [SEP] We are confident that by using the same playbook we used for News Feed and Facebook, we can create a profitable business model for Messenger and WhatsApp. We plan to continue building on the success we have had thus far, while also exploring new opportunities for growth and innovation.","6264":"Our focus on customer retention and acquisition remains strong, and we are pleased to report that this effort is reflected in our current earnings report.

We will continue to invest in these efforts to ensure that our platforms remain the go-to destinations for social networking, news consumption, and online advertising.","6273":"We're now going to look at our projections for the upcoming fiscal year.

[SEP] However, we do expect to see an increase in revenue due to the launch of our new product line.","6274":"We've been asked if we plan to enter the budget market. [SEP] That's just not our vision. [SEP] We've always positioned ourselves as a premium brand and we want to stay true to that.","6275":"We have been focusing on expanding our product offerings to meet the changing demands of our customers. [SEP] At the same time, we're also introducing new SKUs for the front-line worker.

[SEP] And then the third area is we have about two-thirds or so of our total employee base is in the U.S. despite only a third of our revenues being here, and we'll have some things that we'll say about that later in the year. [SEP] But what I can say now is that we're actively exploring ways to expand our presence in key international markets where we see tremendous growth potential. We believe these investments will position us well for the future and help drive value for our customers and shareholders alike.

[SEP] And how do you anticipate your capital strategy evolving as you continue to expand and innovate in this space?","6382":"When asked about our cloud infrastructure, I would like to provide some insight into the efficiency of our costs. [SEP] What I can tell you is we have seen great efficiency on the cost side, the cost to generate the capacity for AWS. [SEP] This has resulted in strong profits for our cloud services division.","6383":"Our team has been working hard to improve our content ranking algorithms. [SEP] We're constantly learning about what our community wants, and we will constantly be trying to incorporate new information and signals into the models to help value all of the content in the system as accurately as possible. [SEP] This is a key part of our commitment to providing the best possible user experience and maintaining the trust of our users.","6384":"We'd now like to talk about our revenue growth. As you can see from the numbers we've just presented, we've had another strong quarter. [SEP] The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. [SEP] This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our entire team, who have continued to innovate and deliver exceptional results. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to sustain this momentum and achieve our long-term goals. Thank you for your support and we'll now open up the call for questions.","6385":"Could you please expand on your revenue collection process? [SEP] We also collect much less overall than others do. [SEP] However, our cost-saving measures have allowed us to remain profitable despite this discrepancy.","6386":"Thank you for joining us today for our Q3 earnings call. \n2. Our team has been working hard to drive growth and improve our operational efficiency. [SEP] And we're making progress across verticals, across our large customers. [SEP] We are particularly pleased with the success we've seen in our healthcare and retail verticals.\n2. We plan to continue this momentum and explore opportunities for strategic acquisitions to further expand our customer base.","6387":"During the quarter, our team worked tirelessly to bring our customers innovative products and services. [SEP] And from an upgrade point of view as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to continue to drive growth through our strong product pipeline and dedicated team.","6388":"Now moving on to our third quarter results. [SEP] And so if you think about all of those components, which actually were very similar to Q2 in terms of their strength, you see them again in Q3. [SEP] Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our company in Q3 and we look forward to finishing the year strong.","6389":"Now let's take some questions from our investors. [SEP] The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being addressed and between the large carriers there with Bharti and now Jio investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it was just 12 months ago. [SEP] Do we have any other questions or concerns related to our operations in India?","6390":"Can you discuss your company's investment strategy going forward? [SEP] I think we look at all of our investments with an eye towards trying to maximize long-term free cash flow at strong returns on invested capital. [SEP] And how does that strategy align with your overall business goals?\"\n\n\"I think we look at all of our investments with an eye towards trying to maximize long-term free cash flow at strong returns on invested capital. That means we are focused on investing in high-growth areas of our business that will deliver long-term value to our shareholders. We also prioritize investments that we believe will be resilient in the face of economic uncertainty and market volatility. Ultimately, our investment strategy is designed to balance risk and reward while positioning us for sustained growth and profitability.","6391":"We take cybersecurity very seriously at our company and closely monitor any potential threats to our systems and data. [SEP] One of the things that I think we need to look out for, that the intelligence community has warned us about is some of the goal of some of these nation-state actors is not necessarily to interfere directly, but to just sow doubt about the legitimacy of an election. [SEP] That's why we have implemented strict security measures and conduct regular training sessions to ensure our employees are aware of the latest tactics used by hackers.","6392":"In the past quarter, we have continued to see growth in our business. [SEP] I talked about some of our global rollouts in the past quarter. [SEP] Our focus for the next quarter will be to continue expanding our market share in emerging markets.","6393":"We're continuing to see strong demand for our cloud services, particularly in the enterprise space. [SEP] But we're increasingly seeing the open source workloads, the Linux workloads, the Oracle workloads, the SAPs and what have you. [SEP] And we're confident that our investments in infrastructure and data center expansion will enable us to capture even more of this market in the coming quarters.","6394":"Our focus this quarter has been on enhancing the customer experience on our e-commerce platform. We're proud to say we've made significant strides in achieving this goal. [SEP] We want customers to be able to see new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking for. [SEP] As part of this effort, we've implemented a new search algorithm and increased the number of filters available to customers when browsing products. These changes have already resulted in higher engagement and revenue. We're excited to continue improving our platform for our customers and partners alike.","6395":"Our operations team has been closely analyzing our performance in China over the past few months. [SEP] We have in fact pockets of good growth in China with our cloud doing fairly well, but at the same time we're grounded that in the fact that we need more work to do and we're working through them and then as and when they will work out, we will let you know. [SEP] Despite the challenges we are currently facing in the Chinese market, we remain confident in our long-term growth strategy for the region.","6396":"We have been hearing feedback from users that they find our platform slightly confusing. [SEP] And so I think our tools are the simplest, but I think we still need to do better [SEP] We are actively working on improving the user experience and simplifying our tools even further.","6397":"Our company has been investing heavily in research and development to stay ahead of our competitors in the market. [SEP] One is an architectural technology advantage around hybrid, right. [SEP] The other advantage is our strong partnerships with key players in the industry, which has allowed us to expand our reach into new markets. \n\nFull statement: Our company has been investing heavily in research and development to stay ahead of our competitors in the market. One is an architectural technology advantage around hybrid, right. The other advantage is our strong partnerships with key players in the industry, which has allowed us to expand our reach into new markets.","6398":"Our Q2 earnings report shows strong growth in revenue and user acquisition. [SEP] We grew across the board with large companies too, but SMBs were really important for this. [SEP] As we continue to expand our product offerings, we anticipate even more growth opportunities in both the SMB and enterprise sectors.","6399":"Looking at our financial performance for the past quarter, we have seen a decline in revenue and profits. However, we have implemented some cost-saving measures to address this situation. [SEP] And we really believe that this will be the bottom and we can start growing from there over time. [SEP] Our strategy for growth includes expanding into new markets and investing in research and development to bring innovative products to market. We are confident in our ability to bounce back and exceed our past performance.","6400":"We've been seeing some interesting trends when it comes to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and their use of technology,\" said the CEO during the earnings conference call. [SEP] If we look at even in the United States, which is a very advanced market, I think it's something like 35% of SMBs don't have a web presence of any kind. [SEP] This presents a huge opportunity for us to reach out to these businesses and offer them our web design and development services,\" continued the CEO. \"We're excited about the potential growth in this area and are already working on several initiatives to capture this market.","6401":"We have been working closely with our logistics partners to ensure that our customers receive their orders in a timely manner. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a significant strain on the global supply chain, but we have adapted quickly and efficiently to meet the needs of our customers. [SEP] But we certainly value our relationships with USPS, FedEx, UPS and other global carriers. [SEP] Our continued partnerships with these carriers allow us to offer competitive shipping rates and provide reliable delivery services to our customers. We are constantly exploring new ways to optimize our logistics operations, and we look forward to continuing our collaborations with our valued carriers.","6402":"We're confident in our ability to meet the growing demand for our product. Our supply chain is running smoothly, and we've invested in expanding our manufacturing capabilities. [SEP] And if we can grow demand faster than we grow supply, then we're going to see that play through in price. [SEP] Of course, there are factors outside our control that could impact pricing, such as changes in the global economy or shifts in consumer preferences. But overall, we feel optimistic about our positioning in the market. Thank you for your questions.","6403":"We've also noticed some interesting trends in the interplay between our domestic and international markets. [SEP] The movement between the two are important. [SEP] In particular, we've seen an increase in cross-border sales as consumers become more comfortable with shopping online.","6404":"Looking to the future, we remain focused on driving innovation and ensuring that our products and services reflect the evolving needs and preferences of our customers. [SEP] But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. [SEP] We are confident that these investments will position us well as we continue to navigate the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic and the broader economic landscape.","6405":"One of the questions we often get asked is about our server KPI and why it has remained consistently high over the years. [SEP] But because of the scale at which it's operating, that's why you still see that server KPI remain at that high level even as the base grows. [SEP] However, we are always looking for ways to optimize our infrastructure and improve efficiency so that we can continue to provide a seamless user experience while also keeping our costs under control.","6406":"Our research shows that our target audience isn't fully aware of the benefits of our product. [SEP] So we need to get to that in messaging. [SEP] Once we do, I'm confident our sales will see a significant increase.","6407":"Our video ad platform has been performing well this quarter, with increased adoption by our clients and positive feedback on its effectiveness. We believe that with growing consumption of video content online, video ads will continue to be a key revenue driver for us. [SEP] One of the things that's really important in this is helping marketers understand that they need to optimize those video ads. [SEP] To that end, we are investing in new tools and technologies that will enable our clients to measure the impact of their video ads and make necessary adjustments. This includes offering detailed analytics on viewer engagement and testing different ad formats and placements. Overall, we are confident that our video ad platform will continue to contribute to our growth in the coming quarters.","6408":"We have noticed some significant shifts in the industry over the past few quarters, particularly in terms of technology adoption. [SEP] I think the data architecture that underlies what's happening in the enterprise underneath applications is going through a dramatic change. [SEP] We believe that this change will enable companies to extract even more value from their data and drive innovation in the enterprise.","6409":"Our sales team has noticed a trend among our customers when it comes to purchasing our software. [SEP] They purchased similarly, was bought with a PC, was bought one time, it was infrequent, with an inability, as Satya said, to add workloads. [SEP] We recognize that this has hindered our customers' ability to fully utilize our software and are actively working on solutions to address this issue. Thank you for the question.","6410":"Now, let's talk about some of the efficiencies we're seeing across our operations. First, we're seeing improvements in our delivery times thanks to investments in our transportation network. [SEP] The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. [SEP] These sort centers allow us to aggregate parcels destined for specific areas, which not only reduces transportation costs but also helps us improve delivery speed. Additionally, we're utilizing machine learning algorithms to optimize routing and reduce the distance traveled by our vehicles.","6411":"Our goal as a company is to create innovative products that truly impact people's lives and change the world for the better. [SEP] The first is build an experience and get it to scale, to build a community that can get to hundreds of millions or 1 billion people or more. [SEP] Once we achieve that level of scale, the second priority is monetization through diverse revenue streams such as advertising, subscriptions, and partnerships.","6412":"As we wrap up this quarter, we want to update our shareholders on our current financial situation. [SEP] We\u2019re looking at our investment. [SEP] We recognize the need to prioritize areas of growth and evaluate where our investments will yield the greatest return.","6413":"Now turning to our revenue streams. [SEP] So we think that ads is a great business model that is aligned with our mission.

The team acknowledged that they recognize the importance of user experience and will strive to strike a balance between monetization and creating value for users. Overall, they remain optimistic about the potential for growth and success in the advertising sector.","6414":"Now turning to our Stories product, I want to take a moment to share some updates on our growth and engagement metrics. [SEP] So I'd say overall not a big change in the gap there and overall the impression growth is really the story for Stories and will remain the story we think for the near future. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our Stories product and improving the user experience. We're excited to see continued growth and engagement in this area and believe it will be a key driver of our business going forward.","6415":"Our goal this year is to strengthen our e-commerce platform and enhance the user experience. We want to ensure that our customers are satisfied with their purchases and have a seamless shopping experience. [SEP] We're working very hard to make sure that it's very easy for customers to buy the things they want to buy and access, a lot of the features they\u2019ve grown accustomed to on the website. [SEP] We're also investing in our mobile app to make it more user-friendly and efficient. Additionally, we're exploring new partnerships and expanding our product offerings to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of our customers. Our efforts are already yielding positive results, and we're confident that these initiatives will drive further growth and success for the company in the future.","6416":"We are pleased to report that our company's Q3 financial results have exceeded expectations. [SEP] And that's broad-based growth across the globe, with particularly strong results in emerging markets. [SEP] Our team is continuing to focus on innovation and expanding our market share in key regions to sustain this growth in the future.","6417":"When it comes to our advertising strategy, we're seeing a lot of success through social media platforms. [SEP] We believe both Facebook and Instagram have this combination of an ability to do great creative with the best targeting in a most sophisticated measurement which shows businesses how we help them move products off shelves. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a significant increase in sales since we began utilizing Facebook and Instagram for our advertising efforts.","6418":"As we look ahead to the next quarter, we're focused on continuing to expand our product offerings and reach new customers. [SEP] But overall, where -- a big focus for us is making sure that individuals and small businesses have access to the same kind of tools that historically only larger companies have had access to. [SEP] We believe this approach will help level the playing field and fuel growth for our company, as well as for the businesses and individuals we serve.","6419":"We're now going to take some questions from the analysts on the call. [SEP] And I think I've said this before. [SEP] But it bears repeating - our focus for Q4 will be on increasing revenue and reducing expenses.","6420":"Can you discuss the trends in average selling prices for the quarter? [SEP] So the combination of these two things obviously had an impact on ASPs. [SEP] However, we are working on a new pricing strategy that we believe will help us maintain our ASPs while still remaining competitive in the market.","6421":"We've been seeing a lot of positive feedback from our subscribers regarding the content available through Amazon Prime [SEP] We love the \u2013 customers love the content and we like the results we see, particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime. [SEP] We're continually evaluating and enhancing the Prime experience to ensure it remains a valuable and reliable service for our customers.","6422":"Our sales team put in a lot of effort to close that deal. [SEP] I think we did really well there. [SEP] However, we still need to work on improving our profit margins in that market segment.","6423":"One area that we are particularly excited about at the moment is our cloud computing segment. [SEP] I even look at the growth of virtual machine instances on Azure. [SEP] We've seen a significant increase in demand for virtual machines as more and more companies are shifting their operations to the cloud.\"\n\nThe speaker is discussing their cloud computing segment and is specifically interested in the growth of virtual machine instances on Azure, their cloud computing platform. This is a significant focus for the company and they have seen an uptick in demand for virtual machines, indicating a greater trend towards cloud computing.","6424":"Our marketing team has been exploring new ways to reach our target audience and increase brand awareness. [SEP] So to share an example, Garmin launched the Fenix 3 Sapphire watch, and they did it with videos ads on Facebook that worked without sound. [SEP] We are pleased to see that this approach has resonated with consumers and helped drive sales for this product.","6425":"As we continue to develop our technology and invest in research and development, we're constantly looking for ways to improve the user experience and provide innovative solutions to our customers. One area that we see a lot of potential for growth is in our smart home products. [SEP] When you have that, I think we're going get to a point where things like TVs, you no longer need a physical TV. [SEP] Instead, you'll be able to project the image onto any surface in your home using our new projection technology. We're also working on incorporating voice activation and artificial intelligence to make the user experience even more seamless and intuitive. We're excited about the possibilities and believe that this is just the beginning of a new era in home entertainment.","6426":"We've had a strong year of growth and are pleased with the results. Our team has worked hard to meet our financial goals, but we're not stopping here. [SEP] So innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy. [SEP] We understand the importance of staying ahead of the competition and providing cutting-edge products and services. This means we may have sudden surges in spending on research and development, but rest assured it's all in the interest of our long-term success. We appreciate the support from our investors and customers and look forward to continued growth and progress.","6427":"Our next question comes from the line of John Smith with ABC Investment. John, you may begin your question. [SEP] And so I actually feel quite good with that outperformance and our ability to see that outperformance fall to the bottom line through stronger executional gross margin percentage, particularly in that segment. [SEP] John: Thank you. Can you provide more insight into the factors driving the outperformance in that segment?\nCEO: Sure. We have been able to increase our prices without seeing much pushback from customers, which has certainly helped the gross margin percentage. We have also been able to streamline our operations and improve our supply chain, which has led to better cost efficiencies. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made in that segment.","6428":"Our Q4 earnings report shows that we have generated record-breaking revenue, and we are pleased with the company's overall performance. We have also made strategic investments in the areas of voice, AI, and grocery delivery to enhance customer experience. [SEP] We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall. [SEP] While we anticipate further growth in the Prime program, we are aware of the challenges posed by competitors and changing consumer preferences. We will continue to innovate and offer value-added services to maintain our leadership position in the market. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our business.","6429":"Our company has seen significant growth in the Chinese market over the past year. [SEP] And so lots of positive things, and you know, as you probably heard me say before, I\u2019ve never seen as many people coming into the middle class as they are in China. [SEP] This trend towards a growing middle class in China is very encouraging for our business and we expect it to continue.","6430":"We recognize that there are significant trade tensions between countries, which have impacted our business and economic conditions. [SEP] And so I'm optimistic that the countries, the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe and so forth, can work these things out and work for the benefit of everyone. [SEP] It is important for all industries to continue to engage in constructive dialogue with governments to address these issues. We remain committed to navigating these challenges and growing our business globally.","6431":"We've had a really great quarter and have seen a lot of success with our cloud computing services. [SEP] But if you look at Boeing or you look at any of the other examples that I talk about when it comes to the cloud, our servers never did what these customers are now doing in our cloud. [SEP] We are excited to continue investing in this technology and improving our offerings for our customers.","6432":"Due to the increased costs of raw materials and production, we have made the difficult decision to increase our prices. We understand this may cause some concern among our loyal customers. [SEP] The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. [SEP] However, we remain committed to providing the highest quality products and services to our customers. We have also implemented cost-saving measures to ensure that the impact of the price increase is minimal. Thank you for your understanding.","6433":"We had a strong quarter, with revenue coming in slightly above our expectations. Our gross margin also improved compared to the same period last year. [SEP] And no specific categories we're calling out as a driver for gross margin because, again, we're much more focused on the profit dollars. [SEP] We are continuing to evaluate our pricing strategy and supply chain operations to find ways to optimize our profit margins. Our goal is to stay competitive in the market while also prioritizing profitability.","6434":"We have been focusing on integrating our recent acquisitions and streamlining our operations. [SEP] So, the integration you spoke of are the right ones we want. [SEP] We believe that these integrations will lead to increased efficiency and profitability for our company.","6435":"We've had some challenges in the supply chain recently. [SEP] And so we've spent quite a bit of time on that, as you might guess. [SEP] But we feel confident that with our new partnerships in place, we'll be able to mitigate those challenges moving forward.","6436":"In response to a question about customer satisfaction, the CEO emphasized the company's commitment to improving their services. [SEP] So there, the most important thing that we need to do is get the basics right and make sure that we are providing, hands down, without any question in anyone\u2019s mind, the clear best service in those areas. [SEP] We have a lot of work to do, but we are making progress,\" the CEO added. \"Our focus is on delivering exceptional value to our customers and building long-term relationships with them. We believe that by doing so, we will continue to grow and succeed in the long run.","6437":"Our team has been working hard to improve our infrastructure and we're seeing positive results. [SEP] So now as the technology on the network level improves to support that, what we're seeing is the ability to serve what is a large amount of demand for what's a very engaging type of content. [SEP] This content has been a major driver of revenue growth for us and we're excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible on our platform.","6438":"Our team has been working hard on improving our customer experience. [SEP] This has to do with wanting to provide customers a very simple way to upgrade. [SEP] We believe that by offering this streamlined process, we can increase our customer loyalty and satisfaction.","6439":"Now, turning to our revenue outlook for the next quarter [SEP] One of the things I would point out is that from a pricing perspective, there are headwinds that we might face on targeting, given the overall privacy landscape in 2019. [SEP] However, despite these challenges, we remain confident in the strength of our product offerings and our ability to navigate the market conditions.","6440":"We have seen strong growth in our e-commerce sales over the past quarter, which has helped to offset the decline in brick-and-mortar retail. [SEP] That's one example. [SEP] We are continuing to invest in our online platform and expect to see even greater growth in this area in the coming years.","6441":"Can you give us any updates on potential partnerships or acquisitions? [SEP] I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. [SEP] We're confident that with the products in our pipeline, we'll continue to see strong growth in the coming quarters.","6442":"Can you speak to how your company plans to compete in the hardware market? [SEP] But on the other hand, from our perspective, we're not a company that's traditionally done hardware or built operating systems or these kind of products. [SEP] So, while we are excited to expand our offerings, we are mindful of the challenges that come with entering new spaces.","6443":"We're really excited to share with you our latest earnings report, which highlights our continued growth and success in the marketplace. We attribute a lot of our success to our loyal customer base and the strength of our brand. [SEP] I think people love Apple products and we are going to do our best to serve the market.

Overall, we feel optimistic about our future growth potential and are excited to see how our company will continue to evolve.","6446":"We've had a strong quarter with solid revenue growth driven by our advertising business.

[SEP] Our focus remains on improving our ad targeting capabilities and delivering relevant and effective ads to our users while also ensuring a good user experience.","6447":"We have looked at the data and polling numbers and feel that our company is well positioned for the potential outcomes of the upcoming elections. [SEP] And we feel relatively confident going into these elections. [SEP] However, we are also prepared for any potential market volatility that may occur in the aftermath of the elections.","6448":"Our financial results for the quarter were impacted by a number of factors beyond our control. [SEP] There is clearly a macro impact, especially on the transactional business. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain focused on executing our long-term growth strategy and are confident in the resilience of our business.","6449":"We are seeing a shift in our customers' preferences towards cloud-based solutions. Our sales team has reported an increase in inquiries about cloud services, and we are taking steps to meet this demand. [SEP] They are moving a significant number of them to the cloud, and in fact replatting to be even multitenant and cloud native. [SEP] This move to the cloud will not only allow our customers to scale their operations quickly, but also reduce their IT infrastructure costs and simplify their workflows. We are investing heavily in building robust cloud-native solutions that will help our customers stay competitive in today's fast-paced business environment.","6450":"Our strategy of expanding our global reach has been successful in recent years. [SEP] So we'll continue to do that. [SEP] We believe this approach will lead to sustained growth and profitability for our company.","6451":"Our iPhone sales have continued to show impressive growth worldwide. [SEP] But when we look at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, where for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. [SEP] Additionally, our expansion into emerging markets such as India has also contributed to the overall success of the iPhone.","6452":"Our Q3 results show an increase in revenue from our Windows PC and Surface device sales. [SEP] We've seen good demand inside commercial entities for and when they make those upgrades to buy Windows PCs and often Surface devices, in that choice, I think it's benefited our OEM partners and us. [SEP] We continue to focus on providing innovative products and solutions to meet the changing needs of commercial customers, and we believe this will drive further growth for our OEM partners and ourselves.","6453":"We are excited about the opportunities for growth in our international markets. We have seen strong performance in several key regions, particularly in Asia. [SEP] And there's also India, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. [SEP] We believe that India has tremendous potential and are committed to expanding our presence there. We have recently opened new offices and are hiring additional staff to support our operations in the region. We are confident that these investments will pay off in the long term and position us for success in this important market.","6454":"Our goal this quarter was to enhance our advertising capabilities and expand our reach to more users. We are excited to announce that we have made significant progress in achieving this objective. [SEP] So, for example, you can buy now in one interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network.

We are also exploring additional opportunities for integration with other social media platforms to further expand our reach.","6455":"We've been keeping an eye on this specific market for quite some time now.

We're excited to see where this could lead us in the next few quarters.","6456":"We have a unique value proposition that sets us apart from our competitors.

[SEP] Our marketing team has done an excellent job of communicating this value proposition to our target audience.","6457":"Our Q2 financial results show impressive growth in both revenue and profit. However, we are aware that financial success is not the sole indicator of our company's progress.

[SEP] That's great to hear. Can you dive a little deeper into what's driving those usage patterns?","6488":"Now turning to our Services segment, which includes both product support and professional services.

[SEP] In addition, our strong partnerships with key industry players and our focus on digital transformation have also contributed to this success.","6550":"One analyst asked about the company's efforts to combat the spread of harmful content on their platform. [SEP] So a lot of what we're trying to do is not just about taking the content down, but it's also about finding ways to prevent it from being uploaded in the first place. We've invested significantly in our content moderation systems and we're seeing positive results so far.

As you know, our operations are global, and currency exposure is a significant risk for us.

Our hedging program is just one of the many strategies that we have put in place to manage risk and ensure sustainable growth.","6571":"Moving on to our cloud services division, we are pleased to report strong growth in our Azure platform.

[SEP] In reality, we prioritize user experience and engagement above all else when making decisions about how to optimize News Feed.","6582":"Another investor on the call asked about the company's plans for expanding its developer tools and offerings.

[SEP] That's in contrast to what we worry is too passive consumption of an experience in News Feed today where people just happen to often see a video and maybe they'll watch it for a few minutes, but may not interactive around as much in News Feed. [SEP] To achieve this, we have been experimenting with new ways to surface content that is more relevant and personalized to each user. We believe that by doing so, we can create a more active and engaging experience that will keep users coming back to our platform and spending more time interacting with the content they love.

[SEP] So all-up, we have multiple pieces. [SEP] We will continue to invest in R&D to drive innovation and maintain our competitive edge in the market.","6623":"We were asked earlier about our relationship with Cognizant and I just wanted to clarify that they are one of our many partners. [SEP] But we have a wide variety of different partners beyond Cognizant who work with us. [SEP] In fact, we're always looking for opportunities to expand our partnerships and collaborate with new companies to bring innovative solutions to our clients.","6624":"Our company has recently undergone a strategic review of our operations. [SEP] The first phase is what I will describe as the upgrade phase. [SEP] During this phase, our focus will be on improving our existing infrastructure and systems.","6625":"Our company has been keeping a close eye on the trends in technology and communication. As we continue to strive for innovation and growth, we recognize the importance of staying ahead of the curve. [SEP] We know that messaging is going to be increasingly important, that\u2019s why we went out and hired David Marcus who is one of the best product leaders in the field to Messenger and why we bought WhatsApp, which the leading messaging product worldwide. [SEP] With the addition of Marcus and the acquisition of WhatsApp, we are confident in our ability to provide the best messaging services to our customers. We look forward to exploring new opportunities and expanding our reach in this rapidly evolving space.","6626":"We continue to provide a platform that encourages civic engagement and fostering a sense of community. Our efforts to improve the quality of discourse and reduce the spread of misinformation have been successful. [SEP] So between January 1 and October 7 of this year, over 68 million people on Facebook in the U.S. made over 1 billion interactions about the campaign alone, and every candidate and every member of Congress is on Facebook now. [SEP] We recognize the importance of our role in the political process, and we will continue to work to ensure that our platform is used ethically and responsibly. We remain committed to empowering individuals to express their opinions and connect with others who share their views.","6627":"Our team has been working diligently to identify areas where we can differentiate ourselves in the market. [SEP] We think that targeting end measurement are significant competitive advantages for us. [SEP] As a result of our focus on targeting end measurement, we have seen a 20% increase in customer retention over the past quarter.","6628":"We have seen a lot of volatility in the commodity markets over the past year. [SEP] Commodity markets may be very different from one year to the other. [SEP] As a result, we have implemented strategies to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations and ensure stability for our shareholders.","6629":"We have been focusing our efforts on improving our cloud services, and we are excited about the progress we have made so far. [SEP] Those choices have been made, but at the same time, now they have a choice around database, and so we think that that's a very good incremental opportunity for us. [SEP] Additionally, we have also been investing in our AI capabilities, and we believe that this will further enhance the value we bring to our customers.","6630":"Our third quarter earnings were slightly lower than expected due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic and global economic uncertainty. [SEP] However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. [SEP] Despite these positive indicators, we remain cautious in our outlook for the next quarter as the pandemic continues to pose challenges for our industry.","6631":"Now, shifting our focus to our growth strategy for the next year. [SEP] I am actually going to cover in commercial segments as one of the drivers of growth for the upcoming year. [SEP] We see a lot of potential in our commercial segments, and we believe that investment in these areas will yield significant long-term gains for our company.","6632":"We have really been focused on executing our long-term strategy over the past year. [SEP] And that strategy, I think, is bearing out and we'll continue to apply it to all of the things that we do. [SEP] Our team is committed to delivering value to our shareholders and customers through this approach.","6633":"We've identified a few key areas where we can optimize our operations. [SEP] So that's one. [SEP] The second initiative is centered around expanding our product line to include more premium options. \n\nFull statement: \"So that's one. The second initiative is centered around expanding our product line to include more premium options. We've identified a few key areas where we can optimize our operations.","6634":"We're seeing a significant increase in sales since the launch, which is why we're excited to provide an update on our financial performance today. [SEP] I was there right after the launch in October. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to maintain this momentum and we're optimistic about our future growth prospects.","6635":"We are very excited about the growth opportunities for Amazon in the physical retail space. Our investments in Amazon Books stores and Amazon Go technology have been very successful in bringing our innovative approach to customers in new ways. [SEP] Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that technology presents. [SEP] We believe these initiatives will continue to drive growth and allow us to further expand our customer base. We are constantly exploring new ways to leverage technology to create a seamless shopping experience for customers and look forward to seeing how these innovations continue to evolve.","6636":"Can you give us some examples of how your product has been utilized in the market? [SEP] So we have a pretty broad spectrum of use cases. [SEP] And what steps are you taking to ensure that your product continues to meet the needs of these diverse use cases?","6637":"We have been closely monitoring the economic situation in China over the past quarter. [SEP] I think that there's a misunderstanding probably particularly in the Western world about China's economy, which contributes to the confusion. [SEP] But I want to assure our investors that our company has a strong strategy in place to navigate any potential challenges in the Chinese market.","6638":"We have seen a lot of success in our efforts to integrate our various technologies and solutions. [SEP] So for example, one of the comments I made in my remarks was, for example, SharePoint with PowerApps and Flow. [SEP] This has led to increased productivity and efficiency for our clients, and we are excited about the potential for further innovation in this area.","6639":"Now, let's turn our attention to our investment strategy. [SEP] Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space, because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience differentiate our products. [SEP] In addition to R&D, we have also made strategic acquisitions that complement our product offerings.","6640":"We've noticed a steady increase in the popularity of our mobile app over the past few months. [SEP] And you see that even in the way customers use it. [SEP] The data shows that customers are using our app more frequently for transactions and account management, which is a positive sign for our business.","6641":"One of the questions we often get asked is whether we believe we have pricing power. [SEP] And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that, but it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace. [SEP] We're constantly monitoring the market and adjusting our pricing strategy to ensure we remain competitive while also taking advantage of opportunities where we can.","6642":"Thank you for your question. Our latest quarter results have been very strong, and we're pleased with the progress we've made so far. [SEP] And on that front, they're both doing great. [SEP] In fact, we've seen significant growth in both markets over the past few months. We're confident that we can continue to build on this momentum and deliver strong results for our shareholders going forward. Thank you again for your interest in our company.","6643":"Can you elaborate on some of the new markets you are targeting? [SEP] Then things like what we are doing to even go to non-knowledge worker audiences in retail or in manufacturing with some of the things that we're doing with staff scheduling for example. [SEP] Are there any other industries you are focusing on reaching with your services?","6644":"We've received feedback from our customers that our website is difficult to navigate. [SEP] But then we have to make it easy. [SEP] We'll be implementing a new user interface that simplifies the purchasing process.","6645":"During the quarter, we experienced some headwinds due to the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic. [SEP] The guidance we gave and our annuity positions in terms of renewals and where we saw them were exactly, frankly, what we expected with the small exception of the geos that I called out [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenging times and continue delivering value to our shareholders. We are also exploring new growth opportunities in emerging markets and digital channels.","6646":"We've been closely monitoring the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and their potential impact on our business. Our team has been actively strategizing ways to mitigate any potential negative effects. [SEP] And so I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently. [SEP] Additionally, we are continuing to explore new markets and partnerships in order to further diversify our revenue streams and reduce our reliance on any one region or country.","6647":"Now let's shift our focus to the upcoming months. [SEP] It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season. [SEP] We're expecting a surge in sales during this time, especially with our new product line. Our marketing team has put together some great campaigns to drive traffic to our website and in-store locations. We're excited to see the results.","6648":"Our App Store continues to be a primary driver of growth and revenue for our company. [SEP] We now have over 2 million apps in the App Store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there are so many out there. [SEP] We are constantly analyzing user data and seeking feedback from developers to improve App Store search algorithms and features.","6649":"We have been focused on building bridges between our apps to create a more cohesive experience for our users. We believe that this will not only improve user engagement, but also increase our ability to monetize our platforms. [SEP] We want to make it so that features that get built across Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp and when people engage on those, it can also make your experience better across the other apps in the family, too. [SEP] We have already started testing some of these features, such as cross-posting between Instagram Stories and Facebook Stories. We have also seen positive results from our recent integration of Messenger and Instagram Direct messaging. We will continue to invest in these cross-platform features in order to create more value for our users and advertisers.","6650":"When we look at user behavior on our platform, we've noticed some interesting trends. Specifically, we've seen differences in the types of content users prefer to share across different devices. [SEP] So on desktop, for example, it's easier to type, so we saw more text posts. [SEP] On the other hand, on mobile devices, we've noticed that users tend to share more visual content like photos and videos. This is likely because the small screen size makes it difficult to type long messages. As a result, we've updated our mobile app to make it more intuitive and user-friendly for sharing these types of content.","6651":"We're really excited about the evolution of our product roadmap and our ability to deliver new experiences to our users. The social aspect of the platform is something we believe will be particularly powerful. [SEP] So some parts of this will not land this year, but I expect a lot of this will start to land this year around this vision of building the private social platform. [SEP] Of course, there will be challenges along the way, but we're confident in our team's ability to overcome them. Ultimately, we believe that this private social platform will be a game-changer for our business, and we're excited to see it take shape in the coming months and years.","6652":"Our team has been working tirelessly to identify new opportunities in the market.\n\n2. Over the past few quarters, we have seen a significant shift in demand towards niche segments. \n\n3. As we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure, we are confident about our ability to capture these new opportunities. [SEP] In fact, I'm very excited about some of the new workloads. [SEP] With the launch of our latest product line, we have already received interest from several high-profile clients. \n\n2. These new workloads present a unique opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves in the market and establish a stronger foothold in key regions. \n\n3. I look forward to updating all of you on our progress in the coming months.","6653":"We have been working hard to streamline our production process and optimize our supply chain. We understand the importance of remaining cost-competitive in today's market. [SEP] We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures and over the life cycle of the product, we are able to bring them down. [SEP] This approach has helped us to remain profitable and drive growth for our shareholders. As we continue to refine our operations, we believe that we can maintain our cost advantage while delivering high-quality products to our customers.","6654":"We have been focusing on creating innovative features for our platform that promote engagement and enhance user experience. Our team has been working hard to identify areas where we can add value and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. [SEP] I think Stories is another example of this. [SEP] Stories has been incredibly successful, with users sharing over a billion Stories each day. We are constantly updating and improving this feature, adding new filters and interactive elements to keep users engaged and coming back for more. We are excited to see the continued growth and adoption of Stories on our platform.","6655":"Our commercial cloud has continued to experience strong growth over the past year. We are pleased to share that our revenue numbers have hit a new high. [SEP] When you think about, you are right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it, and for the year on a pure basis it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue. [SEP] Our team has worked tirelessly to expand our offerings and maintain our position as a leader in cloud computing. We look forward to continuing this growth trend in the upcoming year.","6656":"Our company's focus on providing high-quality goods at competitive prices has been a key driver of our success. [SEP] And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs. [SEP] Our research and development team has been hard at work to identify new opportunities to innovate and improve our product offerings.","6657":"We've received questions from investors and analysts about whether we plan to integrate these two acquired companies. [SEP] In terms of integrating them, no, we're not going to do that. [SEP] Instead, we plan to let them maintain their separate identities and work on synergies where it makes sense within our overall portfolio.","6658":"We have taken a closer look at the recent policy changes that have been implemented in the Indian market. [SEP] We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers. [SEP] Our team is currently exploring alternative options that will better serve the needs of our customers and partners in the region.","6659":"Our second quarter earnings were very strong, driven by the continued success of our App Store business. [SEP] The number of paying accounts continues to grow very strongly, and that's very, very important to us for the App Store business. [SEP] We are continually investing in our App Store to ensure that we provide the best possible experience for our customers and developers.","6660":"Now turning to our plans for the future. [SEP] The developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier, lots of interest there, lots of interest from the Watch App Store, to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the Mac. [SEP] We believe that these new tools will not only drive revenue growth for our company, but also enable our developers to create even more innovative and engaging experiences for our customers. \n\n\"The developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier, lots of interest there, lots of interest from the Watch App Store, to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port an iOS app to the Mac. Now turning to our plans for the future, we believe that these new tools will not only drive revenue growth for our company, but also enable our developers to create even more innovative and engaging experiences for our customers.","6661":"We have recently launched a new product line focused on sustainable materials. [SEP] We are seeing strong traction in that front as well. [SEP] Our sales team is actively promoting these products to customers who prioritize eco-friendly options.","6662":"Our team has been working diligently to streamline our operations and optimize our resources. [SEP] If not the best, we are continually driving up efficiency and lowering costs and we see that in our bottom line. [SEP] We are confident that our focus on efficiency will continue to yield positive results for our company in the coming quarters.","6663":"Our revenue this quarter has exceeded expectations despite the challenging market conditions. [SEP] But I like where we are. [SEP] Looking ahead, we have a solid plan in place to continue our growth.\"\n\nFull statement: \"Our revenue this quarter has exceeded expectations despite the challenging market conditions. But I like where we are. Looking ahead, we have a solid plan in place to continue our growth.","6664":"So, let's talk a little bit about how our user metrics have been trending recently. [SEP] I think on the Facebook app, I just say the DAU trend paints the picture broadly for Facebook. [SEP] We've been seeing some really strong growth in our user base, particularly in emerging markets.","6665":"We have been able to significantly reduce our costs through our device recycling program. [SEP] And then that phone is then redistributed to someone else. [SEP] This not only benefits our bottom line, but also allows us to extend the life cycle of our devices and reduce our environmental impact.","6666":"Can you provide some insight into how the recent market trends may impact the company's profitability in the coming quarters? [SEP] On the second half of your question, I tend to think you're right. [SEP] We are keeping a close eye on any potential headwinds and are actively working to mitigate any negative impact on our financial performance.","6667":"As we look at our financial performance over the past year, there is a trend of some fluctuations that we want to address with our shareholders and investors. [SEP] Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile. [SEP] However, when we look at the overall trajectory of our business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects and our ability to deliver value to our customers.","6668":"We've been working on a number of initiatives to optimize our cost structure and improve our margins. [SEP] So I would expect us to have the biggest change in our margin structure to happen in 2019 and for it to moderate from there. [SEP] Overall, we're optimistic about the outlook for our business and believe we're well positioned for long-term growth.","6669":"Can you provide an update on your strategy in India? [SEP] What I can say about India is when we see a positive surprise we double down on it. [SEP] We have seen some promising growth in our investment in the Indian market and plan to continue to allocate resources accordingly.","6670":"Can you talk about any changes or shifts in your spending strategy for sales and marketing? [SEP] But, yes, we are investing more in general in sales and marketing over time [SEP] We believe this investment will help us reach new audiences and drive growth in the long term.","6671":"We've been receiving questions about our pricing strategy for certain features, so we wanted to address that. First, let's talk about voice calling. [SEP] Yeah, and in terms of voice calling, no, we're not going to charge for it just like we're not going to charge for messaging. [SEP] We believe that offering free voice calling and messaging adds significant value to our platform and helps us attract and retain users. Instead, we plan to monetize through other means, such as advertising and premium features.","6672":"Our company has been closely monitoring changes in consumer behavior when it comes to sharing content. [SEP] Now one of the things that we see is that the way that we are sharing is always changing, and some of this is because of underlying technical transition. [SEP] However, we believe that these technical transitions ultimately create more opportunities for us to innovate and improve our services.","6673":"Now let's move on to a breakdown of our revenue growth for the quarter. [SEP] The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well. [SEP] Specifically, our subscription-based services and licensing agreements contributed to this increase in other revenue, showcasing the diversification of our business model.","6674":"As we look at our subscription numbers, we're really pleased with the continued growth we're seeing across our product lines. Office 365 in particular continues to be a strong performer for us. [SEP] And that's probably frankly been true a little bit longer than we talked about technically in terms of what goes off and what comes on given we've now got, as Satya said, 60 million users and more than that in terms of seats sold. [SEP] We're also excited about the potential for growth in our Teams platform as we continue to invest in new features and capabilities. Looking ahead to the next quarter, we anticipate strong demand for our cloud services and are confident in our ability to deliver for our customers.","6675":"Our one-day delivery service has been a game changer for our customers, and we're seeing strong demand for it. [SEP] So we do need to build out more one-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start. [SEP] In addition to expanding our one-day capacity, we're also investing in technology to optimize delivery routes and improve efficiency.","6676":"We've had a lot of changes over the past year in terms of our product offerings and our organizational structure. [SEP] So there's no \u2013 I don't think we ever are going to declare that we are done making changes. [SEP] Our goal is to continuously adapt and improve as we navigate this ever-evolving market.","6677":"We've identified some really impactful demographic groups that we want to focus on. [SEP] So we look that that and we ask the question of hey, if 100 million people are in those very meaningful groups today, can we get that to be 1 billion people over next several years? [SEP] And we believe that with the right strategy and execution, we can achieve that goal.","6678":"Now let's move on to our international expansion strategy. [SEP] On Brazil, just briefly, yeah we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. [SEP] We've seen strong initial sales in the electronics category in Brazil and we're excited about the potential for growth in this market.","6679":"Our cloud computing division has seen incredible growth over the past year and shows no signs of slowing down. [SEP] In fact as I said, a lot of the Azure use case, I think you referenced this, have been non-zero-sum [SEP] We see even more potential for growth as we continue to expand our offerings and tap into new markets.","6680":"Our research shows that video-sharing is an area that has tremendous growth potential. [SEP] And we're going to focus a lot more on helping people share videos of their moments in their lives. [SEP] We plan to invest in new technology to make the video-sharing experience easier and more seamless for our users.","6681":"Our customers have been consistently requesting faster delivery options. [SEP] So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program. [SEP] We anticipate that this evolution in our shipping program will drive increased customer loyalty and repeat business.","6682":"We had a strong quarter overall, with revenue increasing by 20% year-over-year. Our core business continues to perform well, driven by growth in subscription revenue. [SEP] And then just on your second question around advertising, if you look at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some. [SEP] However, we are still seeing growth in our advertising revenue, albeit at a slower pace. This is due in part to increased competition in the digital advertising space. Nonetheless, we remain confident in our ability to innovate and find new opportunities for growth.","6683":"We have seen strong demand for our products and services, particularly in our wearables category. [SEP] Having said that, I think we\u2019re in a good position and by sometime in late June, we currently anticipate being in a position that we could begin to sell the Apple Watch in additional countries. [SEP] We will continue to closely monitor the global situation and work with local authorities to ensure the safety of our customers and employees as we expand the availability of the Apple Watch.","6684":"Thank you for the question. [SEP] We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. [SEP] Our investments have been focused on expanding our product offerings, improving our infrastructure, and hiring top talent to support our growth. We firmly believe that these investments will pay off in the long-term and position us for success in the increasingly competitive market.","6685":"When looking at our cloud services, we've seen continued growth and adoption from our customers. [SEP] So that's another place where something like Cosmos DB which is very unique in capability in the marketplace is definitely another service that's got real traction. [SEP] We believe that offering these unique services and capabilities is what sets us apart from our competitors and will continue to drive our success in the market.","6686":"Can you provide some insight into the growth potential of this segment? [SEP] If you look ahead five years, it will have ten times that number in it. [SEP] We are confident that our strategic investments and product innovation will continue to drive this growth.","6687":"We've seen a decline in sales over the past quarter and have been trying to identify the key reasons for this. [SEP] So, yes, I do think that price is a factor. [SEP] However, we also need to consider the impact that our competitor's advertising campaigns have had on our sales.","6688":"Our video platform has seen tremendous growth over the past year. [SEP] We have 500 million people watching video a day. [SEP] This represents a 25% increase in daily video consumption compared to the previous quarter.","6689":"Our enterprise business has been a key focus for us this past quarter. We have been working to expand our sales team and increase our market share in this area. [SEP] So you know there\u2019s a lot of factors at play there on the enterprise business, but we are having great success and we\u2019re adding a lot of sales force or sales representatives, especially for the enterprise market. [SEP] We have also introduced new product offerings specifically tailored to meet the needs of enterprise customers. Additionally, we have invested in our customer support team to ensure that we are providing the highest level of service to these important clients.","6690":"Our revenue for the quarter was $10 million, representing a 5% decrease from last quarter. We faced significant challenges in the supply chain due to disruptions caused by the pandemic. [SEP] In this quarter we decreased by 700,000. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to rebound as we have secured new partnerships with key suppliers. Additionally, we have launched a new marketing campaign to expand our customer base. We expect to see positive growth in the next quarter.","6691":"During the call, there were questions about the company's financials related to acquisitions. [SEP] On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. [SEP] Our accounting team has reviewed the paperwork and determined that the accrual is necessary based on current accounting standards.","6692":"We are keeping a close eye on the Asian market, especially China, as it has been showing tremendous growth potential. Our China operations have been performing exceptionally well, and we believe there are still plenty of opportunities to expand our presence in the country. [SEP] I see a lot of similarities to where China was several years ago. [SEP] However, we also recognize the challenges that come with operating in China such as regulatory changes and increasing competition. Despite this, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and capture the vast market opportunities that lay ahead. We will continue to invest in our China operations and work closely with our local partners to ensure sustainable long-term growth.","6693":"Our e-commerce division has seen tremendous growth over the past quarter, with a significant increase in online sales. We continue to focus on expanding our product offerings and delivering unparalleled convenience to our customers. [SEP] We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year. [SEP] In addition to the integration of Whole Foods, we're also excited to announce the expansion of our grocery delivery and pickup services in select markets. We believe this will further enhance the shopping experience for our customers and drive continued growth for our business.","6694":"I want to provide an update on our financial performance for the year so far. [SEP] In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track. [SEP] However, we are continuing to implement cost-saving measures and exploring new opportunities for revenue growth in order to mitigate this slowdown.","6695":"One factor that affected our business performance in the past year is worth mentioning. [SEP] It had a measurable impact on our run rate, our growth rate last year particularly Q2. [SEP] Nevertheless, we were able to recover and even exceed our pre-COVID revenue projections in the latter part of the year.","6696":"We have been reviewing our expenses closely and assessing where we should prioritize our investments. [SEP] But the places where we are more likely to go and put our OpEx in the coming quarters, in the coming years are going to be about revenue that's going to show up for multiple years out. [SEP] We believe that making strategic investments now will position us for long-term growth and profitability.","6697":"Our focus on the commercial cloud has been a key driver of our growth in the past year. We've been putting a lot of effort into improving our gross margins within this segment, and the results have been impressive. [SEP] So our improvement and continued improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin portfolio, I think this is a key criteria of that. [SEP] We're confident that we can continue to drive these improvements going forward. As we invest in new products and services for our commercial cloud customers, we're also working hard to optimize our operations and drive further margin gains. All in all, we believe that our commercial cloud business is well positioned for continued success in the years ahead.","6698":"Now let's talk about the performance of our flagship product, News Feed. [SEP] So on all those measures, we really like what we're seeing and we like the investments that we're making to make that News Feed experience even better. [SEP] We've received positive feedback from users and we're confident that our efforts will lead to sustained growth in the long term.","6699":"Our company has experienced some significant changes in market demand and customer behavior over the past few months. We have also faced supply chain disruptions and increased costs due to the pandemic. [SEP] So there will be differences quarter to quarter. [SEP] However, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects. Our management team is working to implement new strategies and initiatives to adapt to the evolving market landscape. We believe that these efforts will position us for success in the years to come.","6700":"We've had a lot of success with our partnership with LinkedIn this quarter. [SEP] And I would also add, Keith, the LinkedIn team has really done a tremendous job. [SEP] Their platform has been a valuable tool for us in attracting top talent and expanding our professional network.","6701":"Our team has been working hard to identify areas where we can improve our profitability. [SEP] I think that we can grow profit dollars, and I think that we can do that in the OpEx guidance I gave you for 2017, as we continue to pivot to that opportunity. [SEP] Additionally, we will be implementing new cost-saving measures throughout the company to help reach our financial goals.","6702":"Now let's move on to our plans for future product developments. [SEP] On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like auto play in feed, but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. [SEP] We believe that by improving the user experience with video content, we can increase engagement and ultimately drive advertising revenue.","6703":"We've received feedback from stakeholders about our company's ethical practices.

[SEP] The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and I think is going to \u2013 is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook. [SEP] This is a significant shift for us as we move beyond just connecting people and begin to explore new revenue streams in the content space.","6792":"We have noticed a decrease in customer engagement on our platform. [SEP] And those are slow interactions. [SEP] We are currently exploring ways to improve the user experience and make interactions more efficient.","6793":"And now turning to our future growth drivers.

[SEP] Our team is focused on continuing to deliver comprehensive and differentiated solutions to our customers, and we believe this will position us for long-term success.","6799":"We've received some questions about our logistics capabilities, so I'd like to take a few minutes to address those now. As you all know, we take customer satisfaction very seriously and have been working diligently to improve our delivery speeds. [SEP] And then on the logistics question, stepping back, the reason we add logistics capability and transportation capability is so we can serve our customers faster and faster delivery speeds and we've needed to add more of our own capacity to supplement our carriers and our partners.

[SEP] And we are confident that this will lead to strong growth in the second half of the year.","6813":"Can you speak more to the user engagement on your platform? [SEP] And so these whole communities have formed, which was somewhat surprising to us honestly, because we hadn't developed that product specifically for buying and selling. [SEP] But we see the potential for this to be a major part of our business going forward.","6814":"We've seen some competitive offers from our rivals in the wireless industry. [SEP] But I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers.

Additionally, we are implementing cost-cutting measures to mitigate the impact on our bottom line in the short term.","6861":"During the past quarter, we experienced growth in international markets, particularly in Brazil.

With our strong foundation and commitment to tech intensity, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.","6865":"I must say that it was a challenging quarter for us due to the impact of the pandemic on our supply chain and operations. [SEP] In spite of that, it was an all-time record revenue. [SEP] We are confident that our strong financial performance this quarter will enable us to invest in new technologies and expand our business in the coming months.","6866":"So looking at the sales figures, we are thrilled to report that we exceeded our expectations for this quarter. Our team worked incredibly hard to not only maintain our market position but to also expand our reach. [SEP] We sold more units than we thought we would and so that was a part of that. [SEP] However, we did experience some unexpected costs in production which affected our profit margins. We are actively working to address these issues and ensure we can continue to grow while also maintaining financial stability. Overall, though, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and excited for what the future holds.","6867":"We've seen growth beyond what we initially anticipated in our advertising sector. [SEP] It's not just what people think of as direct response advertisers. [SEP] We've had success with brand advertisers as well, who are seeing the value in our targeted approach. This has led to a more diverse range of advertisers utilizing our platform.","6868":"We have seen significant growth in our top line revenue over the past year. [SEP] The first one's just pure revenue scale. [SEP] As we continue to expand our customer base and product offerings, we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future.","6869":"When you look at our growth in the cloud space over the past year, it's been really remarkable [SEP] And I think, in fact unlike any other time other than Windows, we've not had this kind of platform effect. [SEP] Our goal is to continue to build on this platform effect and create even more value for our customers.","6870":"Another question from the line is from Karl about the recent surge in expenses. [SEP] Karl, thanks for asking that question; it gives me a chance to reiterate how many of those components are bit one-time in nature. [SEP] However, we are constantly reviewing our expenses and identifying areas where we can optimize costs in the long run.","6871":"We have seen a decline in revenue due to the end of support frame for our on-premise products. However, we are encouraged by the growth of our cloud-based solutions which have been steadily gaining traction. [SEP] And so when it's annuity based there is really no opportunity to see it as upside in Q4 from an end of support frame. [SEP] While we do not expect any immediate improvement in our Q4 performance due to the annuity based structure of our cloud products, we are confident in their long-term potential for revenue growth. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in the development and expansion of these solutions to maximize their impact on our business.","6872":"The company has seen significant growth in international markets.\n- Shareholders asked about the company's approach to global regulation and how it could impact their investments. [SEP] Well, one of the things that I\u2019ve been focused on is trying to help develop global frameworks where possible, but the challenge of course, with that is that except in a limited number of cases, regulation typically isn\u2019t global; it\u2019s national. [SEP] Despite the challenges with diverse regulations, the company remains committed to operating within legal frameworks in all countries where it does business.\n- We are actively engaging with policymakers to encourage more collaboration on international regulations.","6873":"Now moving on to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] On the CapEx guidance, this is really just about better visibility on how spend will come through. [SEP] We have also identified some areas where we can optimize our spending and reduce unnecessary costs.","6874":"We recognize that the smartphone market is becoming increasingly saturated. In order to stay competitive and continue to grow, we need to look beyond just phones. [SEP] The big shift that we are making when it comes to phones is to not think about phones in isolation. [SEP] We are focusing on creating an ecosystem of devices and services that seamlessly integrate with each other. This means developing products like smartwatches, tablets, and home assistants that work together to provide a comprehensive user experience. By doing this, we believe we can set ourselves apart from our competitors and provide our customers with a truly connected experience.","6875":"I'd like to now turn our discussion to our various business segments and provide an update on their performance. [SEP] Frankly, our display business has been quite good. [SEP] We have seen strong growth in both our digital and programmatic advertising offerings, which have helped to offset any declines in traditional print advertising.","6876":"During the last quarter, we successfully acquired XYZ Company and added their technology solutions to our portfolio. [SEP] And we went through this process of integrating that and making sure that it\u2019s integrated with all these system well. [SEP] As a result of this integration process, we have seen increased efficiency and effectiveness in our operations. Our teams are now able to access all necessary data and information through one centralized system, improving overall productivity. Thank you for your attention and we look forward to sharing more updates in our next earnings call.","6877":"Our strategy for the coming year is to focus on enhancing our portfolio mix. [SEP] So that aggregate portfolio is what helps us move up the margin curve. [SEP] We believe that by continuing to strategically allocate resources towards high-margin products, we can maintain the positive momentum seen in our most recent earnings report.","6878":"Thanks for your question. [SEP] On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well. [SEP] We're constantly striving to improve our logistical operations and provide the best possible experience for our customers.","6879":"We've been working hard on developing new strategies to grow our business in the coming year. [SEP] So that's one way that I think that this will be valuable. [SEP] Additionally, we've also been exploring partnerships with other companies in our industry that could help us leverage our strengths and better serve our customers.","6880":"We have seen significant growth in user activity over the past quarter. [SEP] But across all of the different types of content issues of people trying to spread hate or incite violence. [SEP] Our content moderation team has been working diligently to identify and remove any harmful content as quickly as possible.","6881":"We've seen a significant increase in user engagement on our platform. [SEP] And people in our community, they don't know the difference about whether that content is coming from Facebook or a different place. [SEP] This is a testament to the strength of our content curation and recommendation algorithms.","6882":"Our goal is to provide seamless and productive experiences for our users across all of our platforms. [SEP] And so, you will see us \u2013 with Windows 10, so you'll see us continue to do these integrations that add value again to both the Microsoft 365 and Dynamics users, as well as LinkedIn members. [SEP] This will not only benefit our current users but also attract new customers to our integrated ecosystem.","6883":"Moving on to our regional performance, let's start with the Rest of World segment. [SEP] And then rest of world, we saw some countries come back online like Ethiopia came back online. [SEP] However, we did experience some challenges in other markets such as Venezuela and Iran due to economic and political issues.","6884":"In terms of advertising, we saw significant growth in the number of ads delivered to users during the quarter. [SEP] Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunities to continue to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on our other apps such as Instagram. [SEP] As we continue to expand our presence globally and invest in new products and features, we believe there is still ample room for growth in the advertising space for both Facebook and our other properties.","6885":"Now turning to our financial performance for the quarter [SEP] And then on your question of marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was up 110 basis points year-over-year. [SEP] We continue to invest in targeted marketing campaigns to drive organic growth as well as customer acquisition through strategic partnerships.","6886":"We are seeing steady growth in demand for our EMF products. The positive feedback from our customers is a testament to the quality and utility of our offerings. [SEP] EMF continues to be I think of incredible value to customers. [SEP] As we continue to innovate and expand our EMF product line, we believe we can capture even more market share and deliver even more value to our customer base. Our focus on meeting their needs and exceeding their expectations has been and will continue to be a driving force behind our success.","6887":"We've seen some challenges in the market recently that have led us to re-evaluate our projections for the rest of the year. [SEP] So really, it\u2019s the compounding of those three issues that are creating headwinds that we think are going to impact us, as we get later in the year and into 2020. [SEP] However, we are confident in our ability to adapt and make necessary changes to continue delivering value to our shareholders.","6888":"Now let's take a closer look at our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] If you back out exchange that\u2019s approximately breakeven, included in there we certainly have a sizeable step up in investment in India. [SEP] However, we believe this investment is critical for our long-term growth strategy in the region.","6889":"We have seen incredible growth in our advertising revenue in the past quarter, due to our strategic efforts and investments. [SEP] And, again, that's a big part of what we're trying to do to drive the overall ads growth story, as well as providing a good experience for users with the ads that they're seeing. [SEP] In addition, we plan to continue investing in research and development to improve our ad targeting capabilities and provide even more relevant and personalized ads for our users.","6890":"During the past quarter, we've been focusing on improving the user experience on our platform. We identified that the quality of the content and the ability to share it with others were two areas that needed improvement. [SEP] So we ran a bunch of qualitative studies and talked to a bunch of people and incorporated those signals into the model, and that has had the result that the people in our community who gave us that feedback and who we worked with on this, what we had expected in terms of both increasing the quality of the content that people see, and therefore also enabling people to share more with their friends and the people that they want. [SEP] We're very pleased with the results we've seen from these changes. User engagement has increased by 25%, and we've seen a significant uptick in the number of new users signing up for the platform. We will continue to monitor user feedback and make adjustments as needed to ensure that our platform remains a valuable resource for our community.","6891":"As we look towards our expansion plans for the upcoming quarter, we're excited to announce our focus on entering the South American market. [SEP] We have a lot to do there, we think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. [SEP] Our team has been conducting extensive market research and we are confident that our product will satisfy the needs of consumers in this region. We will be deploying additional resources to ensure we are successful in establishing a strong presence in South America.","6892":"Now let me move on to our financial performance for the second quarter. [SEP] So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. [SEP] In terms of operating income, we expect to see a range of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, compared to $3.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020.","6893":"We have seen great success over the past year in building strong relationships with our customers. [SEP] And we have the business model that aligns with them and their interests and the trust. [SEP] Our team is committed to continuing to prioritize customer satisfaction, as we believe it is crucial to our continued growth and success.","6894":"We believe that measurement is a really important area for our industry, for our advertisers, and for us if we're going to enable the best advertising experiences possible. Without measurement, there's no way for us to know whether the advertising that's being delivered is actually effective. [SEP] because if we can connect, people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy, in stores or in other ways, that's how you close the loop and that's why we put so much investment and hopefully so much innovation behind measurement. [SEP] We've made a lot of progress in this area, but we still have a long way to go. We're continuing to invest heavily in measurement technology and are looking for innovative ways to close the loop between advertising and purchasing behavior. We're committed to providing our advertisers with the best possible tools to measure the impact of their ads and make more informed decisions about their marketing investments.","6895":"Now let's turn to our performance in our various business segments. [SEP] So we're very happy with the results in video. [SEP] However, we still need to focus on improving our results in our print division.","6896":"Can you provide some more detail on the fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter? [SEP] It was very lumpy this time with 18 warehouses in one quarter and another five in the first three weeks of the next quarter. [SEP] How do you plan to address this uneven distribution of warehouse openings in the future?","6897":"We are currently evaluating a new technology that has the potential to revolutionize our production process. [SEP] We want to make sure we get the safety implications of that right. [SEP] Our team is working closely with industry experts and regulatory bodies to ensure that we have a thorough understanding of any potential safety risks.","6898":"Our earnings for this quarter were strong, with a significant increase in revenue from our Azure cloud services. [SEP] So, I\u2019m actually hoping that going into this next fiscal year, we do a much better job and customers do a much better job, but they don\u2019t benefit because the advantage Azure has because of the hybrid used benefits across the entire workload are pretty phenomenal, and we had a good set of sessions at our partner meetings this week just really making sure that everybody understand those benefits. [SEP] We believe that hybrid cloud solutions will continue to be in high demand, and we are investing heavily in developing our offerings in this area. Additionally, we are seeing growing interest in our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, which we believe will be a major source of growth in the coming years.","6899":"Our latest financial results reflect the successful launch and adoption of Windows 10 across all segments, especially in the enterprise. [SEP] I think the overall adoption cycle of Windows 10 in the enterprise is perhaps the best that we have seen in the enterprise for any new release of Windows, and primarily driven by security and manageability of the new Windows, and that's what's been the driver. [SEP] We are committed to continuing to improve and innovate the Windows ecosystem to meet the evolving needs of our enterprise customers and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.","6900":"We're looking to expand our business into new markets this year. [SEP] So there's a lot of foundational work that needs to get done there. [SEP] However, we're confident that the investments we're making now will pay off in the long run.","6901":"Moving on to our financial results, I'd like to highlight a couple of important factors that have affected our performance this quarter. [SEP] The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of life and we dealt with it for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated against the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. [SEP] Despite this challenge, we have been able to maintain strong sales numbers by focusing our efforts on emerging markets where our products are still highly competitive.","6902":"Now turning to our performance in the grocery sector. [SEP] So if you adjust for those, with the Whole Foods growth year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis was approximately 6%. [SEP] We anticipate continued growth in this area and have plans for expansion in several key regions.","6903":"We have been evaluating the feasibility of expanding our operations in India. [SEP] And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection and better convenience for the Indian customer. [SEP] However, we will continue to monitor the Indian market and explore opportunities for growth in the future.","6904":"Thank you for your question, Steve. [SEP] And I will think general what we see, especially as contract gets larger, for us the opportunity under Tier 1 workloads for us to really see TAM growth. [SEP] Our focus on innovation and efficiency has been key in securing new contracts and expanding our market share.","6905":"Now let's delve into our overall business strategy. [SEP] Just to recap the framework that we have here, the strategy is there are three phases for that. [SEP] The first phase involves market analysis and product development, followed by a roll-out phase where we enter the market and establish a customer base, and lastly, the scaling phase where we aim to increase market share and profitability.","6906":"Our team has been working diligently to prepare for the enterprise deployment phase, which we anticipate will be a significant milestone for our company. [SEP] We expect the enterprise deployment to start in earnest the beginning of next calendar year or the second half of this fiscal year. [SEP] We recognize that many of our stakeholders are eagerly anticipating this next step, and we are committed to keeping everyone informed of our progress and any potential challenges that may arise. Thank you for your continued support and investment in our success.","6907":"We have seen strong revenue growth in the past quarter, and our team has been very pleased with the performance of our advertising initiatives. [SEP] So I think we're still seeing good growth in Europe on the revenue front, and a lot of the similar dynamics playing out in Europe as in the rest of the world where you see good impression growth opportunity, especially in areas like Instagram and Stories contributing to overall ability to drive revenue growth. [SEP] Looking ahead to the next quarter, we are confident that we will continue to see significant growth in Europe and other key markets around the world.","6908":"Our virtual reality division has continued to see strong growth, particularly with the Gear VR headset. [SEP] I think Samsung shipping 5 million Gear VRs. [SEP] This is a significant milestone for the company, as it demonstrates the widespread adoption of virtual reality technology.","6909":"Now let's move on to a region-specific analysis of our Q4 earnings. [SEP] To give you a perspective in of some detail, our business in India in Q4 was flat. [SEP] However, our overall revenue for the quarter saw a significant increase due to the successful launch of our new product line in North America.","6910":"We are excited to share with you the progress we have made in our digital transformation strategy. [SEP] In fact you should think of Azure as the common fabric of all our applications. [SEP] By leveraging Azure, we have been able to improve our efficiency and responsiveness to customer needs.","6911":"We have seen strong growth in our online sales channel this quarter. [SEP] So there is, in that sense, a cannibalistic effect of sorts that happens there. [SEP] However, we believe that ultimately the shift to online purchasing will lead to greater overall revenue for the company.","6912":"Our focus has always been on providing the best possible customer experience. [SEP] We added, of course, we have over 100 million items that customers would get within two days, but there's now over 3 million that will be delivered within one day or faster in 10,000 cities in town. [SEP] This has been made possible due to our investments in our logistics and delivery systems, as well as expanding our network of warehouses and fulfillment centers.","6913":"Our financial results for the previous quarter have been stellar, with our revenue exceeding expectations. We have been working tirelessly to grow our iPhone sales and we have reason to believe that our efforts will pay off. [SEP] We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base that on what we are seeing from a switcher point of view, we recorded the highest rate on record for Android switches last quarter at 30%. [SEP] Furthermore, we are seeing a strong demand for the latest iPhone models, particularly from emerging markets. We are confident that we will continue to gain market share and deliver strong results in the coming quarters. We will continue to invest in product innovation and customer experience to maintain our competitive edge.","6914":"Our company has been investing heavily in developing online marketplaces that have grown significantly in popularity over the past year. [SEP] I mean, we have Facebook Marketplace is probably the most advanced and hundreds of millions of people use that to buy and sell things. [SEP] We are continuing to explore new ways to enhance our existing marketplaces and potentially launch new ones to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","6915":"We've seen a lot of interest in our new subscription service over the past month. Many customers have taken advantage of our 30-day trial offer and signed up to try it out. [SEP] People are just coming out of the 30-day trial period in the last few days or week or so. [SEP] We're now analyzing the data from those who completed the trial period to assess the success of the program and determine our next steps. We're optimistic about the results so far and believe that we can continue to drive adoption and revenue growth over the coming quarters.","6916":"We've had several factors impacting our advertising revenue this quarter. [SEP] And then the second factor is just we're seeing proposed changes from the mobile platforms that are more oriented towards privacy which could affect targeting and measurement and make that more difficult. [SEP] However, despite these challenges, we are confident in our ability to adapt and continue to provide value to our advertisers and users. We have several initiatives underway to mitigate the impact of these changes and find new avenues for revenue growth.","6917":"We are pleased to report strong growth in our productivity software division. [SEP] The small business number I talked about, the 50,000 per month additional customers that we're adding to Office 365. [SEP] This growth in Office 365 adoption is largely driven by our continued investment in new features and capabilities that make it an essential tool for small businesses.","6918":"We're now going to take some questions from the analysts on the call. [SEP] Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. [SEP] But overall, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter.","6919":"Another question we have is about your plans for expanding into new markets. [SEP] We're excited about this kind of thing but this is as early as anything could be. [SEP] Can you elaborate on the current stage of development and when we can expect more concrete details?","6920":"As we continue to analyze our growth trends across our different platforms, we wanted to highlight the performance of Instagram. [SEP] So we\u2019re certainly seeing good growth in places where Instagram is strong, including the U.S., so that\u2019s been good to see. [SEP] In addition to the U.S., we're also seeing strong growth in key international markets where Instagram has a strong presence.","6921":"We are pleased to share with you our fourth quarter earnings report. [SEP] The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. [SEP] This achievement would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our entire team.","6922":"Our new product line had a slow start due to supply chain issues and delayed shipments. [SEP] But we were able to get this in a lot of different merchants and I give them a lot of credit for that. [SEP] As a result of their efforts, we saw a significant increase in sales and brand awareness in the past quarter.","6923":"Now let's turn to our financial results for this quarter. [SEP] Our overall long term under imbalance has been impacted by the Windows 10 deferral over the past. [SEP] However, we are optimistic about the outlook for the next quarter as we expect to see the impact of our recent product launches and marketing initiatives.","6924":"We've seen a decline in our sales revenue over the past quarter. [SEP] And that's where we have a lot of work to do. [SEP] However, we have identified some key areas for improvement and are confident in our ability to turn things around.","6925":"We've noticed that our customers have been experiencing some difficulties with the website's checkout process. [SEP] And at some point we will probably want to work on that [SEP] But for now, our priority is launching our new product line and ensuring a smooth holiday season for our customers.","6926":"Now turning to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] There\u2019s a foreign exchange element, and I mentioned before the negative impact on a sequential basis about 40 basis points. [SEP] However, on a year-over-year basis, the impact was positive, contributing 20 basis points to our overall revenue growth.","6927":"Our advertising team has been working hard to identify areas where we can continue to expand our reach and provide value to our clients. [SEP] I think we've taken our experience on how to help advertisers migrate to the right places and been able to do that even more quickly in new formats like Stories. [SEP] As we move forward, we plan to continue leveraging our experience and expertise to help our advertising partners successfully navigate new platforms and formats.","6928":"Now, let's move on to our advertising segment. Our advertising revenue was up 28% year-over-year, reaching a total of $16.6 billion. We continue to see strong demand from our advertisers across all regions and industries.

[SEP] Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an advertising part of our North American consume segments. [SEP] But can you give us an idea of how much growth you're seeing in the advertising segment compared to the rest of your consumer business?\"\n- \"So, do you foresee any changes to your advertising strategy in the coming quarters?","6931":"Now I'd like to turn our attention to our marketplace business, which has been a significant area of focus for us this quarter.\"\n- \"We've been closely tracking several key metrics and are pleased with the progress we're making. [SEP] We're really encouraged with what we are seeing, both on the customer side and the seller side. [SEP] One area of particular strength has been our international expansion efforts, where we've seen a steady increase in both customer and seller activity.\"\n- \"Overall, we feel confident in our ability to continue driving growth in the marketplace and remain committed to investing in this important area of our business.","6932":"We're now going to take some questions from the analysts. [SEP] On CapEx, we still expect to be within the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, and we're investing aggressively in our data center footprint to support the global growth that we see. [SEP] Our investments in AI and machine learning are also continuing, and we're seeing promising results from these initiatives.","6933":"We prioritize delivering high-quality service to our customers. [SEP] So we always do that. [SEP] And it's one of the reasons why we have such high customer retention rates.","6934":"Can you give us an update on how your company is positioned among the competition in the market? [SEP] As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we provide to customers. [SEP] However, we are constantly monitoring and analyzing our competitors' strategies and adjusting our own approach accordingly. We believe that staying proactive and innovative is crucial to maintaining our position as a market leader.","6935":"One question that investors may have is about the company's growth strategy. [SEP] It's not a simple thing that you can apply a set formula to or one variable or a couple of variable formula in my opinion. [SEP] Therefore, it's important that we continue to analyze the data and look at multiple factors to make informed decisions in our business operations.","6936":"Now moving on to our investment strategy for the upcoming quarter. [SEP] So the way we think about our overall investment, I think of this as a systems investment [SEP] By investing in a cohesive system, we believe we can maximize efficiency and profitability across all of our operations.","6937":"Our database segment continues to be a strong performer for us. [SEP] We have a very good business in SQL Server, we have perhaps the most competitive SQL Server product ever in SQL 2014, which is growing nicely. [SEP] We're also excited about the potential growth opportunities in the cloud computing space for SQL Server.","6938":"We've been evaluating our expenses and revenue streams carefully in order to make sure we're making strategic decisions moving forward. [SEP] So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said. [SEP] Our goal is to continue to grow the company while also maintaining financial stability.","6939":"Our team has been working hard to diversify our revenue streams. While traditional product sales are still a major part of our business, we recognize the importance of expanding into services. [SEP] And so as we are able to grow the services business, that should provide a positive, a tailwind. [SEP] Of course, there will be challenges along the way. We will need to invest in training and hiring additional staff to support our services offerings. But we are confident that this shift in focus will ultimately pay off for our company and our shareholders in the long run.","6940":"Thank you for that question. [SEP] On the category mix question, you know, obviously category mix does play a role in the gross margin.

[SEP] In the past quarter we expanded further internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program, again, offering free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items. [SEP] We're seeing great uptake and positive feedback from customers in these markets, which is encouraging us to explore additional international opportunities. We remain committed to providing our customers with fast and convenient delivery options, and we're excited for what's to come in the future.","6943":"We saw significant growth in our advertising revenue this quarter. Our team worked hard to develop new ad formats and improve targeting capabilities. [SEP] And teaching people here is what a Facebook ad looks like was a new format people had to understand.

We will continue to innovate and improve our offerings to provide better results for our advertising partners.","6944":"We've been investing heavily in our data analytics capabilities over the last few years. Our focus has been on building out a robust data ecosystem that enables us to gain deeper insights into our business operations and customer behavior. [SEP] And given that, we want to have these leading indicators showing up in our dashboard not are static reports and Power BI is this rich canvas for us to be able to, one, visualize data as well as ask natural language questions. [SEP] In fact, we're now working towards integrating Power BI with our other data management tools to create a more seamless user experience for our analysts and business users. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to access and interpret our data in a more intuitive and efficient way. We believe the combination of leading indicators and dynamic visualizations will empower us to make smarter, more informed decisions about our business strategy going forward.","6945":"Our earnings report for this quarter has been very positive, with strong performance across all our business units. Our mobile News Feed apps in particular have been a key driver of our success. [SEP] The business continues to perform very well, driven off the strength of our mobile News Feed apps business, and really consistent with the trend we've seen in the last several quarters, we would expect that year-over-year ads growth rate to decline modestly in Q3 and Q4, and it's really a function of the law of large numbers and the natural maturation of our ad business. [SEP] However, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of our ad business, and we will continue to invest in new technologies and strategies to drive growth and innovation. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter and look forward to building on this momentum in the months ahead.","6946":"We've been closely monitoring the performance of our emerging markets, and while we've seen some challenges, overall we're pleased with the progress we've made. [SEP] And so I think, or at least the way that I see these, is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story, and I don't see it as some sort of issue that is common between those for the most part. [SEP] Of course, there are always going to be macroeconomic factors that affect these markets, but in general, we believe we have a strong strategy in place. Our focus now is on continuing to build our brand and expand our reach in these regions.","6947":"We've received a lot of positive feedback from our customers about the new product launch. [SEP] I think our partners have done a terrific job on that as well. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a significant increase in sales since its release.","6948":"Our company is actively expanding our global reach. [SEP] We have significant content from the U.S. market. [SEP] This gives us a competitive advantage in targeting American consumers.","6949":"We are currently working on expanding our operations and increasing our market reach. [SEP] And so both of those are all happening in parallel. [SEP] We believe that these efforts will lead to significant growth and profitability in the coming quarters.","6950":"We have been closely monitoring user feedback and privacy concerns. As a result, we have been working on several initiatives to address these concerns. [SEP] And then finally, we are rolling out our own product changes such as the recent launch of OSA that's our user control on what data stored on Facebook activity. [SEP] We are confident that our new product changes, including OSA, will help increase user trust in our platform. We remain committed to improving our user experience while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security.","6951":"During the Q&A session, an analyst asked about the company's policies on hate speech and nudity. [SEP] So one of the pieces of criticism that I think we get that I think is fair is we're much better able to enforce our nudity policies, for example, than we are hate speech. [SEP] Our team is working hard to improve our hate speech detection algorithms and we're already seeing some progress in reducing the amount of problematic content on our platform.","6952":"Moving on to our financial outlook, we are revising our guidance for the year based on the current market conditions and foreign exchange exposure. As you know, the global economy has been impacted by changing exchange rates and geopolitical challenges. [SEP] And just if you're looking on a non-FX adjusted basis, the foreign exchange exposure, which I mentioned was $730 million or 250 basis points expected in this guidance. [SEP] However, we have implemented several cost-saving measures and have gained market share in key regions that will help mitigate the impact of these challenges. We remain committed to achieving our growth targets and are confident in our ability to do so.","6953":"Our financial results for the quarter have been very encouraging and we are pleased to report a significant increase in revenues and profits. [SEP] On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 400,000 employees, both full-time and part-time in the U.S. and UK will be getting a substantial wage increase. [SEP] This wage increase is part of our ongoing commitment to invest in and support our employees, who are the backbone of our company. We hope that it will not only improve their quality of life but also enhance their overall job satisfaction and loyalty to the company.","6954":"Can you elaborate on the timeline for achieving network efficiency for a new facility? [SEP] We still say it takes up to three years or three peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility, and that's about the same although the whole network gets sufficient over time. [SEP] However, we have been implementing new technologies and processes that have helped us reach network efficiency faster than in the past.","6955":"Our team has been closely examining the usage trends and patterns of our Messenger platform. [SEP] And so, when we think about the format of Messenger, we think about the direct correspondence between a person, either an existing or a potential client or with a business, and we think there are many times in kind of a life cycle of interacting with a business where that's a very attractive opportunity. [SEP] Additionally, we believe that Messenger has the potential to become a valuable tool for customer service and support, further strengthening our relationships with our clients.","6956":"Our team has evaluated the useful life of our equipment and has determined that it is shorter than previously estimated. [SEP] So, we are going to start depreciating them on a four year basis. [SEP] This change in our depreciation schedule allows us to more accurately reflect the value of our assets on our financial statements.","6957":"During the past quarter, we saw steady growth in our user base and engagement levels. Our advertising revenue also showed strong growth, particularly in the mobile segment. [SEP] We're excited to bring the UEFA Champions League Soccer and College Basketball to Facebook, and we're going to continue to experiment with developing many different forms of content for Facebook. [SEP] We believe that creating original content for Facebook is a key strategy for driving user engagement and increasing revenue. In addition to sports content, we're also exploring opportunities in the areas of news, entertainment, and gaming. We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the coming months.","6958":"As we look ahead to the next quarter, there are a few key metrics we will be keeping a close eye on. [SEP] I don\u2019t -- easier way frankly to think about that Keith is our Q4 gross margin and our Q1 gross margin. [SEP] Of course, we understand that there are many factors that can impact our gross margins in the short-term, but we feel confident that we have a solid strategy in place for the coming months.","6959":"Now I'd like to turn to our Amazon Business segment. [SEP] Amazon business, yes, in April you may remember we launched it as a marketplace with specific features and benefits for businesses. [SEP] Can you give us an update on how it's been performing and any plans for expansion?","6960":"We've invested heavily in improving our technology infrastructure over the past year. [SEP] So I think the systems are much more robust. [SEP] This should help us avoid any major issues or outages in the future.","6961":"We are very excited about our latest feature on Messenger that allows businesses to connect with their customers in a more seamless way. Our team has worked hard to ensure that these interactions are efficient and effective for all parties involved. [SEP] But in terms of the business, the more important piece is how people can interact with businesses through Messenger. [SEP] We have seen a significant increase in usage of this feature, with many businesses reporting higher customer satisfaction and engagement rates. This is a key area of focus for us moving forward, and we will continue to improve and enhance these capabilities to better serve our customers.","6962":"We have identified two main challenges facing us in the upcoming quarter. [SEP] And the other one is the fact that our existing hedges expire. [SEP] We are actively working on implementing new hedging strategies to mitigate this risk.","6963":"Our team has been closely monitoring customer trends and analyzing data to gain insights into emerging patterns. We've noticed some significant shifts in behavior over the past few months. [SEP] we see huge changes in customer behavior taking place now. [SEP] As a result of these changes, we are taking steps to adapt our strategies and offerings to better meet the evolving needs of our customers. We believe that by staying nimble and responsive, we can continue to build strong long-term relationships with our customer base.","6964":"We have found that our targeted advertising has not been performing as well as we had hoped. To remedy this issue, we have decided to change our bidding strategy for ad placement. [SEP] They'll then bid differently into the auction. [SEP] We expect this new strategy to result in more effective targeting and ultimately increase our return on investment. Additionally, we will continue to monitor and make adjustments as necessary to ensure the best outcomes for our advertising campaigns.","6965":"Thank you for joining us on this earnings conference call. As we review our financial performance for the quarter, I am pleased to announce that we exceeded expectations with strong revenue growth. [SEP] And you heard on this call me give a few examples of where we're already able to connect what happens in terms of ads with real sales of real products. [SEP] This connection between ad performance and sales is a powerful tool for our business, and we plan to invest in this area further. We believe that this technology will enable us to better understand and serve our customers, ultimately driving even greater revenue growth in the future. Thank you for your continued support of our company.","6966":"We've recently made some changes to our product offering. [SEP] So I don't think it's a philosophical shift. [SEP] Rather, it's an adaptive response to the ever-changing market conditions.","6967":"Our user base has seen significant growth over the past year. [SEP] And I think when you look at the value, I think we feel good about the opportunity to continue to move these users including new first-line or frontline users that we've not had access before. [SEP] We will also be exploring options to expand our product offerings to attract new user segments and drive further growth.","6968":"As we discuss our Q3 earnings, I want to take a moment to highlight some exciting developments in our product offerings. [SEP] But in addition to that, I must say there are two other things that are increasingly becoming fairly relevant in the adoption cycle, which is moving to both Office 365 and Windows 10 and getting essentially to this new frontier for productivity, which is an always up-to-date operating system, which is secure, and an always up-to-date Office experience that is a SaaS service. [SEP] We are seeing strong adoption rates for both Office 365 and Windows 10, with many customers recognizing the benefits of a cloud-based, always-updated software suite.","6969":"During this quarter, we experienced increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies. [SEP] We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. [SEP] These changes did result in some temporary disruptions to our operations, but we are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges.","6970":"We have seen a lot of success in our expansion into the Asian market. [SEP] So we will continue to invest there. [SEP] Our team is confident that this investment will lead to long-term growth and profitability for the company.","6971":"Our cloud computing services have delivered strong results this quarter. We have seen promising growth in our Azure platform offerings. [SEP] If you go up to the Azure marketplace today, you'll see that. [SEP] We are continuously working to improve the Azure marketplace experience for our customers. Our team is dedicated to providing a wide range of solutions and tools to help businesses thrive on our platform.","6972":"We have noticed a significant decline in our revenue stream from our Hong Kong subsidiary. [SEP] And our perspective on that is it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the U.S. dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the U.S. dollar. [SEP] However, we are exploring opportunities to hedge our currency exposure in the future to mitigate this risk.","6973":"As we look to the future growth of our business... [SEP] We certainly have additional delivery capability of our own. [SEP] But we also recognize the importance of partnering with third-party delivery services to reach more customers in a cost-effective manner.","6974":"We noticed a decrease in our earnings for the last quarter. [SEP] It can be product-launch related. [SEP] However, we are optimistic for the upcoming quarter as we plan to introduce several new products to the market. It can be product-launch related.","6975":"We've seen a lot of growth in our sales and marketing efforts, and we're excited for the upcoming product launch. [SEP] And to your specific question, Mark, before every launch we tend to have a tightening in the channel as they prepare and run reasonably lean. [SEP] However, we expect the channel to loosen up fairly quickly after the launch and anticipate strong sales throughout the quarter.","6976":"Can you discuss any recent developments or accomplishments in the international markets? [SEP] We've done many things we're the only cloud provider for example that operates in China. [SEP] This has given us a unique advantage in this market, but we still face some challenges with navigating the government regulations.","6977":"We've seen strong growth in Q1 and are excited to share our results with you today. [SEP] So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove. [SEP] As we move forward, we'll continue to focus on delivering value to our customers and driving profitability for our shareholders. \n\nFull statement: \n\n\"We've seen strong growth in Q1 and are excited to share our results with you today. So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove. As we move forward, we'll continue to focus on delivering value to our customers and driving profitability for our shareholders.","6978":"Thank you for that question. [SEP] We do realize it's a period of investment and we're in different stages of growth in different countries. [SEP] However, we remain focused on our long-term strategic goals and are confident in our ability to deliver strong returns to our shareholders in the future.","6979":"Now, turning to our products and their performance in the market, I would like to discuss one particular aspect that has caught my attention. [SEP] I look at my own usage of one note in Surface. [SEP] As a technology enthusiast myself, I believe that this feature has a lot of potential for growth and will continue to drive demand for our devices.","6980":"Our company has seen tremendous success in the tablet market. In fact, our latest earnings report shows that tablet sales have increased by over 30% year-over-year. [SEP] And so by very high, I mean that if you look in some of the developed market like the U.S., Japan, the UK, you would find that 50% of the people are buying an iPad for the first time. [SEP] This truly demonstrates the growing demand for tablets among consumers. We are excited to continue innovating and improving our tablet offerings to meet this demand and provide the best experience for our customers.","6981":"During this quarter, we faced some challenges with our revenue growth, which impacted our overall financial performance. We understand that this may cause concerns among our shareholders and investors. [SEP] You know it\u2019s going to be hard on revenue growth, it\u2019s going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make or some are faster than others and some have other work to do before they can migrate. [SEP] However, we want to assure you that we remain committed to driving sustainable revenue growth over the long-term. We are taking steps to enhance our sales and marketing efforts, as well as improve our product offerings to better serve our customers. We are confident that these measures will help us overcome the short-term fluctuations and deliver strong financial results in the future.","6982":"Thank you all for joining us today for our earnings call. [SEP] We just passed our Fifth Year Anniversary \u2013 celebrated our Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site in India. [SEP] Our success is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team, and we look forward to continued growth and success in the years to come.","6983":"We have been exploring ways to increase engagement across our platforms. [SEP] That's something we can put in News Feed in Instagram and Messenger and it both grows the ecosystem and creates a new opportunity for interaction. [SEP] Our research shows that users want more opportunities for social interaction within our apps.","6984":"We're seeing strong growth in this sector, especially in emerging markets. [SEP] so there's a great opportunity here. [SEP] We plan to increase our investment in research and development to capitalize on this potential.","6985":"In terms of ad load, we continue to expect in the second half of the year that ad load will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth. We anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months. [SEP] because every time we put an ad in newsfeed, if it\u2019s a video ad, it\u2019s taking a place of an ad with another format. [SEP] As ad load continues to be less important, we are focusing on ad quality and relevance to drive better performance for advertisers. We are also exploring other revenue streams, such as in-stream video ads and sponsored content, to diversify our business.","6986":"Our team has been focused on driving growth and increasing adoption of our Office suite of products. [SEP] And we were able to see that this quarter across all the core workloads in Office. [SEP] We expect this trend to continue as we invest in improving user experiences and expanding our offerings.","6987":"Thank you for your question. We have had a lot of success in our first year of operation, but we recognize that there is still a lot of work to be done to fully realize our potential. [SEP] So, there's always learnings that we have that's why we say it's still day one here. [SEP] We believe that by staying focused on our core values and continuing to innovate, we can build a truly great company. We are excited about the future and look forward to sharing our progress with you in the months and years ahead.","6988":"We have seen strong demand for our new product line. [SEP] And so there is a real benefit right now to being an early adopter, the pricing is very attractive. [SEP] As the product gains traction in the market, we may adjust the pricing accordingly.","6989":"As we expand our fulfillment capabilities, we also incur certain costs that impact our margins. [SEP] And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. [SEP] However, we anticipate that these costs will decrease as the fulfillment center reaches its full capacity.","6990":"We have invested heavily in our AI technology to enhance our products and services. Our goal is to integrate AI into all aspects of our business. [SEP] So over time we may not have to ramp it as much, but I don't foresee any time in the near future that AI is going to make it to that if the cost comes down. [SEP] However, we are always keeping an eye on advancements in technology and will adapt accordingly. At the moment, we believe that the investment in AI will ultimately pay off in the long run and provide significant benefits for both our company and our customers.","6991":"Our company has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence technology for the past year. [SEP] That doesn't mean that the computers will be thinking or be generally better, but that is useful for a number of things. [SEP] This improved efficiency and accuracy will ultimately save our company both time and money.","6992":"Let's take a closer look at our customer metrics. [SEP] On the customer side \u2013 excuse me, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year. [SEP] This significant increase in active customer accounts is a testament to the strength of our marketing and sales efforts, as well as the appeal of our products and services to consumers.","6993":"A question from an analyst asked about the competition between Azure and AWS. [SEP] First of all, I don\u2019t think that of the comparison between Azure and AWS is the true north for me. [SEP] I believe that there are many factors to consider when it comes to choosing a cloud provider, and it's not just about who has the biggest market share.","6994":"We are always looking for ways to improve efficiency in software development. Our team has been exploring ways to reuse code and data across different projects. [SEP] So reuse of code, reuse of data, so you would use some amount if iOS infrastructure and then past consumption. [SEP] This approach reduces the time and resources needed to build new applications and features. By leveraging the iOS infrastructure and past consumption data, we can create better experiences for our users while reducing development costs. We believe this is the right strategy to drive growth and profitability in the long run.","6995":"We're seeing continued momentum across the board in our advertising business, with particularly strong growth in our Instagram ad business. In fact, we're pleased to announce that we've hit a major milestone... [SEP] And as I mentioned, 98 of our top 100 advertisers in Facebook are now advertising on Instagram. [SEP] with 2 million active advertisers on Instagram. That's double the number we had just two years ago. We believe we still have a lot more opportunity to grow this business as we continue to improve our ad products and help businesses of all sizes connect with the right audiences on Instagram.","6996":"Can you give us more details on which products are being offered through the new partnership? [SEP] It's not our entire selection, it's tens of thousands of items that they may need on a daily basis. [SEP] We believe this will greatly benefit our customers by providing them with convenient access to essential items at competitive prices.","6997":"Now, I'd like to talk about some of our recent innovations and experiments. [SEP] We've been running an experiment with mobile financial services in Messenger, and one of the things that we found in the Philippines, for example, is that people can buy access to data plans through Messenger. [SEP] We are excited about the potential this holds for opening up new revenue streams in emerging markets.","6998":"Our revenue for the quarter was $16.9 billion, up 11% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong demand for our advertising products and are constantly working to improve our targeting capabilities. [SEP] We then work on helping them use our ad products and upsell them to our paid ad products as well, and we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram. [SEP] Our focus in the coming quarter will be on expanding these numbers even further and providing even more value to our advertisers. We are also investing heavily in our virtual event capabilities, as we believe this will be a crucial area of growth in the coming years. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.","6999":"We have seen impressive growth in our gaming division this quarter and are excited to announce our plans for the future. [SEP] In other words, we have now increasing past services that we are going to reinforce on Azure and attract more game developers [SEP] Our team has been working diligently to create new and innovative solutions for game developers using Azure. We believe that this investment in our gaming services will fuel further growth in this sector and continue to position us as a leader in the industry.","7000":"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our products and services to better meet the needs of our customers. [SEP] So really that's a big part of the focus. [SEP] In addition to improving our products, we are also investing in our employees to ensure they have the training and support they need to provide exceptional customer service.","7001":"We've had some challenges in our sales department this quarter. [SEP] So, I don\u2019t really think of that as being negative, and you saw the exact same behavior and dynamics. [SEP] Overall, we're still confident in our growth strategy moving forward.","7002":"As we continue to expand our services and offerings, we see many of our customers beginning their journey with us in one area and gradually utilizing more of our solutions as their needs grow and evolve. [SEP] I think the Maersk example I walked you through is probably a good one, where it may start with some commodity workload on Azure or it may start with Office 365, but then it will end up with HoloLens and someone using Dynamics 365 for increased automation. [SEP] This is the beauty of our integrated, cloud-based platform - it allows businesses to seamlessly adopt and integrate new tools and technologies as they become necessary for their operations.","7003":"As we move forward into the next quarter, I want to address some concerns about our sales numbers. [SEP] Now over the next period, especially in H1, we continue to see -- expect to see very good hybrid percentage and execution, which help to offset some of that. [SEP] Additionally, our team is working hard to streamline our production processes to further improve efficiency and reduce costs.","7004":"We're now going to take a question from an analyst on the line. [SEP] The biggest focus \u2013 the biggest impact of the focus on meaningful interactions as Mark mentioned will be in areas like passive video, where from a business perspective, we monetize less on a time spent basis. [SEP] So we think with this focus on meaningful interactions, we can actually create a better experience for people who are engaging with passive video, and that will ultimately drive more value and more monetization for us.","7005":"Our focus for the next quarter will be on expanding our video capabilities. [SEP] So there's a big space here in terms of helping people have real connections and interactions around video. [SEP] We've already seen a positive response from users in our initial testing phases and we're excited to continue growing this area of our platform.","7006":"Our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction has driven strong growth in our mobile app usage. [SEP] You can also have Siri call for you, you can send messages, you can get a Uber car or a Lyft car. [SEP] We continue to explore partnerships and integrations with other popular services to expand the convenience and capabilities of our app.","7007":"Our sales team has been making great strides in promoting iPads to businesses and we have seen significant growth in this area. [SEP] I\u2019m a big believer in the ability for iPad to play in a major way in enterprise. [SEP] With the introduction of new features and enhancements, such as multi-tasking and Apple Pencil support, I believe the iPad will continue to be a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes.","7008":"We are pleased to announce that we have exceeded expectations for this quarter. Our team has been working hard to deliver strong results and we are thrilled with the outcome. [SEP] And so our internal goal was to be able to beat the thousand level, and we thought it would be great if we were able to do that by a little bit. [SEP] I am happy to report that we have in fact surpassed our goal and achieved a revenue of $1,200. This is a significant milestone for our company and a testament to the dedication of our employees. Moving forward, we will continue to strive for excellence and look for new opportunities for growth.","7009":"As we continue to see growth in the industry, we've noticed a shift towards hybrid solutions in the manufacturing space. [SEP] And then there is the hybrid choices, where if somebody's building a smart factory, they're now looking and saying, what is the server I deploy in the factory to manage the millions of sensors that are there across the factory. [SEP] Our team has been working tirelessly to develop cutting-edge servers that can seamlessly manage these high volumes of data, leading to increased efficiency and productivity within the smart factory environment.","7010":"Moving on to our social media strategy, I wanted to highlight the impressive growth we've seen on our Instagram account. [SEP] because 90% -- more than 90% of Instagram users are following a business. [SEP] This presents a huge opportunity for us to reach our target audience and drive sales through the platform.","7011":"I'd like to address a question we received about our cloud strategy.\"\n- \"As we continue to shift towards cloud-based solutions, I think it's important to clarify our approach. [SEP] Again Mark this goes back to a little bit of understanding I guess how we think about both X as well as OpEx in terms of our cloud. [SEP] Basically, we see X as a key driver of cloud adoption among our customers.\"\n- \"And when it comes to OpEx, we try to balance cost savings with investments in innovation and scalability.","7012":"Our Q3 earnings report is showing significant growth in several areas, including our advertising revenue. We've been working hard to improve our offerings and create more value for our customers and advertisers. [SEP] Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offering's more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America, although not in the North America segment. [SEP] However, we did see a decrease in advertising revenue in the North America segment due to some unexpected market challenges. We're addressing these challenges and remain optimistic about the growth potential in this region. Overall, we're pleased with the strong performance of our advertising business and will continue to invest in improving our offerings.","7013":"I am pleased to report on another successful quarter for our company. [SEP] Our growth this quarter was very broad-based across all of the regions [SEP] In particular, our latest product release has contributed significantly to our increased sales and customer engagement.","7014":"We've received a lot of feedback from our customers about the shopping product. [SEP] But on the shopping product itself, it is still very early days and we're working to improve the product and it's quite small. [SEP] However, we're confident that with continued development and marketing efforts, we can drive growth in this area.","7015":"We understand that our users are eager to see the improvements we've promised to our platform. [SEP] So we'd ask for some patience on this to do this correctly, and the game plan will be more similar to what we did in Facebook with News Feed. [SEP] We want to make sure that the changes we implement not only address these concerns, but also align with our company's values and goals for growth.","7016":"During the last quarter, Microsoft's cloud business has grown significantly, but we are interested to hear more about the factors behind the growth. [SEP] Really, Karl, what can drive that in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud, it's also really the strength we see in our Windows business. [SEP] Can you provide us with some specific examples of how the Windows business has contributed to the overall gross margin improvement?","7017":"We have seen strong growth in our sales figures this quarter. [SEP] So that's looking great. [SEP] With the launch of our new product line next month, we anticipate even further growth in the coming quarters.","7018":"We started this experiment with just a few thousand users to see if it would catch on. [SEP] And now it was more than 100 million people doing this, I think we\u2019ve really proven as part of that hypothesis, that this is something that people are going to want to go do. [SEP] We are excited to continue to expand and improve our platform to meet the growing demand for this type of experience.","7019":"We've noticed a significant increase in engagement and click-through rates on our online advertisements over the past quarter. [SEP] because it takes \u2013 it makes the ads more relevant. [SEP] Our team of data analysts have been implementing machine learning algorithms to better understand consumer behavior and preferences, and we believe this is a major factor in our recent success.","7020":"We\u2019ll now turn to our segment results, which were in line with our expectations. Overall, our team executed well during the quarter, and we continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives. [SEP] And so, we did see a bit of growth that we were excited to see frankly on a segment where we\u2019ve been working hard to make additional progress and add value. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain committed to driving profitable growth in this segment through a combination of operational improvements and targeted investments. We see significant opportunity to capture market share in this space, and we\u2019re confident that our team has the skills and expertise to execute on our plans. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.","7021":"Can you give us an update on your company's plans for 5G technology?\"\n- \"I'd like to ask about the impact of 5G on your business in the coming years. [SEP] With respect to 5G, I think most people would tell you, we're in sort of the extremely early innings of it. [SEP] What steps is your company taking to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to 5G adoption?\"\n- \"Do you see 5G as a significant growth driver for your business in the long term?","7022":"Thank you for your question on our second quarter results.

[SEP] As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories have become wider over time and therefore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past, because we got this much wider sales price dispersion, so unit of sale per se becomes less relevant.

We believe that by making these strategic investments in both our infrastructure and workforce, we'll be able to achieve this goal and position ourselves for long-term success.","7110":"Our company has been expanding its global presence over the past year.

[SEP] It's not necessarily in the overall geo footprint build out. [SEP] However, we are always evaluating opportunities for growth and may consider expanding our geo footprint in the future.","7112":"A question was raised about how pricing affects customer decisions regarding AWS. [SEP] Its probably is worth adding that, although prices are factor, the primary factor for customers choosing with AWS is really around their ability to move quickly and to be nimble and agile [SEP] Our team is always focused on enhancing this agility and speed for our customers by investing in new technologies and features.","7113":"Now, let's move on to our financial outlook for the next quarter. [SEP] The starting point for our expectation would be, the usage growth would be very \u2013 that our growth in infrastructure costs would start with the growth in usage, which has been exceeding the revenue growth rate. [SEP] However, we have implemented cost management strategies to control expenses and optimize our infrastructure investment.","7114":"We are pleased to report strong growth in our AWS business segment. [SEP] The multitude of launches that we had in reinvent was great for all sizes of customers, really, both large and small; both companies starting \u2013 just getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years.

[SEP] The government stimulus, this came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold one. [SEP] As a result of this VAT reduction, we've seen an increase in consumer spending across all of our markets.

[SEP] We'd like to take this opportunity to share some of the highlights and challenges we faced during these two years and our plans for the future.","7119":"We have noticed a decline in the sales of our virtual reality headsets this quarter. While the pandemic has led to an increase in the demand for virtual reality, we have observed that most people are now using it indoors and for personal entertainment. [SEP] You're not wearing VR out in public. [SEP] However, we are still optimistic about the future of virtual reality. With advancements in technology and the growing popularity of virtual events, we believe that the demand for VR in the public domain will increase eventually. We are currently exploring opportunities to partner with companies in the hospitality and tourism sectors to bring VR experiences to public spaces like malls, parks, and tourist attractions.","7120":"We have received a lot of interest and questions about our plans for virtual reality technology.

[SEP] We've received a lot of positive feedback from both our employees and customers regarding their experience with these new skills.","7123":"Another area of focus for us has been voice technology. As we continue to innovate and improve our products, we recognize the importance of voice as a key interface for consumers. [SEP] But in all of these different ways, voice and how people interact with each other and eventually building products that allow people to interface with our products through that, we\u2019re quite focused on this.

We believe that voice has the potential to transform the way people interact with technology and we want to be at the forefront of this innovation.","7124":"We've seen incredible demand for our products over the past quarter, particularly for the iPhone and Apple Watch. [SEP] The reverse of that is also true, is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided I really want something to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth like the watch does so well and so it's not always a linear path. [SEP] That's why we continue to innovate and create new products that meet the evolving needs of our customers. We're excited about the upcoming release of the next generation Apple Watch, which will include even more advanced health and fitness features.","7125":"Thank you all for joining us today for our Q4 earnings conference call. I\u2019d like to start by providing an update on our current financial performance. [SEP] And then in Q4, last time on this call I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty.

I will now turn it over to our CFO for a more detailed financial update.","7126":"We're committed to offering a wide range of products to our customers.

[SEP] You see it this quarter. [SEP] Our new product launch drove increased revenue and customer engagement, and we expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters.","7129":"We've seen tremendous growth over the past year and we believe that much of it is due to our investments in digital technology. [SEP] So we're super excited to have the platform and to continue to invest in it. [SEP] We believe that the platform will allow us to further enhance our customers' experience and improve our overall efficiency. We anticipate significant returns on our investment in the coming years.","7130":"Our focus for this quarter has been on increasing the adoption and integration of our Office suite of products.

[SEP] We're already seeing great results in terms of increased developer engagement and customer satisfaction.","7131":"We're seeing strong growth in our business and demand for our products and services is robust.

[SEP] So we see the combination and they're not all happening coincident, but there is time lag in it but therefore that\u2019s one of the reasons why we want to be very aggressive in getting the workloads on to Azure both storage and compute; and even in the storage and compute, we now have premium offerings for higher SLA, for higher performance, higher VM sizes and then on top of that, we have these managed services which have a different margin profile. [SEP] As we continue to expand our offerings and improve our margins in this area, we believe Azure will be a key driver of our overall business growth. We're confident in our ability to continue to innovate and meet the needs of our customers in this ever-evolving landscape.","7133":"We've been expanding our services to new regions recently. [SEP] And we also open up to new customers when we add these regions. [SEP] Our goal is to increase our client base and revenue streams by tapping into these untapped markets.","7134":"Thank you for the question. Now turning to our cloud services business [SEP] And in the case of AT&T we were the only public cloud in there. [SEP] Our strong performance in this segment is a testament to the value we bring to our customers and our ability to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive market.","7135":"We're still working on the specifics of our plan to continue growing our company. [SEP] But I can't tell you just yet what that timeframe is going to look like, but I think we're well-positioned over the long-term because we're leading in Stories in basically every country.

[SEP] But I think we\u2019re off to a good start. [SEP] We have several new product launches slated for Q2 and are confident in our ability to continue this positive momentum.","7137":"Now let's shift our attention to the potential growth opportunities in our energy sector. [SEP] I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on. [SEP] We will continue to explore and invest in these assets to drive long-term value for our shareholders.","7138":"We've made significant investments in our cloud infrastructure over the past year, and I want to talk about how that's impacting our business. [SEP] So that\u2019s why utilization of that entire infrastructure is how we think about even total return on invested capital for our cloud business. [SEP] We're seeing great results from the investments we've made in our cloud infrastructure, and we expect this to continue to drive growth for our business in the coming year.","7139":"In terms of our earnings performance, things are shaping up well. We saw solid revenue growth across all business segments, and we\u2019re making good progress on cost management initiatives. [SEP] On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. [SEP] However, we\u2019re closely monitoring the effects of the ongoing trade tensions and potential further currency fluctuations. We\u2019re also exploring opportunities to expand into new markets to mitigate any potential impacts on our earnings.","7140":"Can you talk a bit more about the pricing strategy for our products?

However, our goal is to encourage customers to sign up for our subscription service, which not only provides them with convenience and cost savings but also ensures repeat business for us.","7141":"Thank you for joining our earnings call today. We are pleased to report our Q1 results. [SEP] First, the top-line growth was \u2013 continued to be strong coming out of Q4.

Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth for the remainder of the year.","7142":"We are constantly evaluating our performance and looking for ways to improve our offerings to advertisers. [SEP] Our goal is to give marketers the highest return they can and over time to capture the amount of budget that's equivalent to the percentage of media time we capture and we're not there. [SEP] We have identified certain areas where we need to improve, such as targeting capabilities and measurement tools, and are investing heavily in these areas to better serve our clients.","7143":"The technology landscape is constantly evolving, and we are continuously exploring new ways to improve our offerings and increase our efficiency.

[SEP] Wearables has very, very strong momentum. [SEP] We plan to build on this success with new product launches and innovative features in the coming months.","7148":"Our company has always been committed to creating a safe and responsible online environment for our users. [SEP] And we see a lot of that online and that's a pretty big issue from everything from bullying to terrorism, there are lots of reasons why people might otherwise have the tools to share what they would want but feel silenced. [SEP] That's why we've invested heavily in technology that can identify and flag content that violates our community guidelines, and why we continue to work closely with law enforcement to combat harmful behavior.","7149":"The company has been experiencing growth in the past quarter, with increased revenue and a steady rise in customer acquisition. However, there are challenges when it comes to determining the appropriate compensation for employees and executives. [SEP] You don't know how much to pay.

[SEP] And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience. [SEP] In addition to our hardware offerings, we're also continuing to invest in our software and services, such as Apple Music and iCloud, to provide a seamless user experience across all devices.","7154":"We've received a lot of questions about the ongoing legal battles surrounding patent infringement between our company and some of our competitors. I'd like to take a moment to address this issue. [SEP] And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. [SEP] We'll continue to work closely with regulators and take all necessary measures to protect our intellectual property. But at the end of the day, what really matters to us is delivering the best possible product to our consumers.","7155":"Moving on to our financial performance, our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.78, which is in line with our guidance.

This has required a shift in our approach and a greater emphasis on understanding our customers' needs. [SEP] And I think the way we've seen this in the field is -- and our sales organization has been not unlike some of these Dynamics transactions or the Power platform transactions that require a fundamental understanding of business process and the changes you're trying to implement. [SEP] To support this shift, we've invested heavily in our sales training programs and have seen great results. Our sales teams now have a deeper understanding of our customers' businesses and are able to present solutions that are tailored to their specific challenges.

Do we have any last questions for our CEO? [SEP] On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, as you know for us, will always be the product and the experience.

[SEP] However, initial data suggests that there has been a significant increase in website traffic and engagement since the launch.","7166":"Moving onto our financial performance for the quarter, I'd like to first highlight our gross margin. [SEP] As you know, we typically have what we call product transition costs during the September quarter, and this year we also have about 30 bps of headwind from foreign exchange again because the dollar has appreciated recently. [SEP] However, we expect these costs and headwinds to be temporary and anticipate improved margins in the upcoming quarters.","7167":"We've been very focused on improving our risk management processes over the past year. [SEP] We're judging our success by how proactive can we get, so what percent of the stuff that we're taking down are we identifying before other people identify it for us.

[SEP] For us, this is an important investment and it's very strategic. [SEP] We believe this acquisition will help us expand into new markets and strengthen our position in the industry.","7169":"Our revenue for the quarter was slightly lower than expected, but we still had a strong performance overall. We attribute this to the fact that there's some volatility in the ins and outs based on seasonality. [SEP] because there's some volatility in the ins and outs based on seasonality. [SEP] However, we anticipate there will be a significant uptick in revenue during the next quarter as we launch a new product line. We also plan to implement more targeted marketing campaigns to drive sales during traditionally slower months. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our annual revenue goals.","7170":"We're excited to announce the expansion of our software offerings.

We believe that by improving these metrics, we can increase the value of our platform to advertisers and continue to grow our revenue. Thank you for your questions and for joining us on this call today.","7175":"Our focus continues to be on driving growth and profitability. [SEP] And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. [SEP] This is a positive trend that reflects the strength of our brand and the effectiveness of our sales strategy.","7176":"Now we'll open up to questions from the investors.

[SEP] And the pilots, the place which in the second half is going to be a huge focus for us is the enterprise deployment, and that's where I think there's real excitement [SEP] Our enterprise deployment efforts will be a key component of this strategy, and we're working hard to make sure we hit the ground running. We believe there's significant potential in this area, and we're excited to see the results of our efforts in the coming months.","7190":"One of the things we've been focusing on is our product innovation. We continue to invest in our R&D to make sure we have the best technology in the market. [SEP] And our ability to blend them into interesting products that solve customer solutions, which may not even be priced as the component parts, is I think how we think about, especially in our solution areas that Satya talks about, how we talk about delivering it to a customer. [SEP] We've also been looking at ways to streamline our supply chain so we can deliver products faster and more efficiently. Our goal is to make sure we can meet the needs of our customers in a timely manner. Overall, we're confident that our approach to product development and delivery will continue to drive growth in the coming year.","7191":"Our next question comes from the line of [Analyst Name] from [Investment Firm Name]. [SEP] And then I'd say across all of our apps, we're seeing strong adoption of Stories and, on WhatsApp Status products around the world, and that continues to provide another way for people to connect and share. [SEP] Do you see any specific regions or demographics driving the growth in Stories and Status?","7192":"Now let's turn to our Q4 earnings results. [SEP] If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter in Q4, we felt very good about cloud demand across all three services, but in particular with Azure. [SEP] We believe this trend will continue into 2021 as more businesses prioritize digital transformation and remote work solutions.","7193":"We have some updates regarding our financial reporting. As many of you know, we have recently adopted ASC 606, which is a new revenue recognition standard. [SEP] The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of ASC 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM. [SEP] However, it's important to note that ASC 606 will impact our overall revenue recognition and financial reporting beyond just Windows OEM. Specifically, we expect changes in how we recognize revenue from our cloud offerings and other subscription-based products. We will continue to evaluate and communicate these changes as they occur.","7194":"We'd like to take a moment to highlight the growth of our messaging platform. [SEP] Messenger today has 1 billion organic interactions between businesses and consumers each month. [SEP] This success is a testament to the investments we have made in building out new features and improving the user experience.","7195":"Our team has been working hard to improve our content moderation policies and processes. [SEP] It helps us identify content that might be offensive or graphic that might violate the policies of Facebook so we can flag that and review that better. [SEP] We have also invested in AI technology that is able to detect harmful content before it is even reported by users.","7196":"We acknowledge that there has been a decline in user engagement and trust in our platform. This is largely in response to the various controversies that have plagued our company in recent years. [SEP] And therefore over time the community feels less comfortable sharing that kind of content on Facebook. [SEP] We are working tirelessly to regain the trust and confidence of our users. We have implemented various measures to curb misinformation and hate speech, and we will continue to invest in these efforts moving forward.","7197":"Over the past year, we've seen unprecedented changes in the way we do business. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated many trends that were already in motion, and forced us to adapt to a new reality. [SEP] That's perhaps the biggest shift in our industry that we've seen in our lifetimes. [SEP] As a company, we've had to transform the way we operate in order to meet the changing needs of our customers. We've invested in new technology, reimagined our supply chain, and embraced new ways of working. While we've faced many challenges along the way, I'm confident that we're well-positioned to succeed in the years ahead.","7198":"Our strategy for our digital media division has been focused on expansion into new markets.

[SEP] We believe this will position us well for continued growth and profitability in the years to come.","7199":"Our strategy for this year is to focus on expanding our market reach and improving customer satisfaction.

Thank you for your continued support as we work towards creating long-term value for our shareholders.","7200":"We've seen some questions from investors about our revenue recognition process, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify. [SEP] And then there are transactions, like for example, App Store sales, where a portion of the transaction does not get recognized by Apple, but it goes to the developer. [SEP] This is because we only recognize revenue for the portion of the transaction that represents our fee for facilitating the sale.","7201":"In response to a question about Instagram's e-commerce capabilities, the CEO of the company explains how they see potential in making shopping more seamless on the platform. [SEP] So when you think about the shopping experience or the checkout experience on Instagram, these are still very early days, and we're working hard to improve the product and expand to more businesses. [SEP] The CEO also notes that the company is constantly soliciting feedback from businesses and users to improve the shopping experience on Instagram. Additionally, they are exploring new ways to integrate payment and shopping features into the platform to make it easier for businesses to sell products directly to customers.","7202":"We have seen strong demand for our products during this quarter, especially for the iPhone line. [SEP] You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward. [SEP] Our focus remains on delivering exceptional experiences to our customers and continuing to innovate in the market.","7203":"Thank you for taking my question. \n2. I wanted to follow up on the video tab that was announced last quarter.

[SEP] Can you provide more detail on the steps you're taking to achieve that goal? \n2. Additionally, how do you plan on leveraging your existing partnerships to support this initiative? \n3. Thank you for your time on this call today.","7204":"We're now moving onto our plans for the rest of the year.

[SEP] We'll be sharing more updates on these new services as we near their launch dates.","7205":"We have seen strong growth in our user base and engagement metrics, which has translated into increased revenue and profits. Our advertising business continues to perform well, particularly with our focus on mobile-first approaches. [SEP] Then you can start thinking about Messenger and some of the other platforms we have. [SEP] We are also exploring new opportunities in the emerging markets, where we see significant potential for growth. Our investments in artificial intelligence and virtual reality are progressing well, and we anticipate that they will become increasingly important to our business in the coming years.","7206":"Thank you for the question, next question please. [SEP] Yes, I think that's a fair interpretation of my commentary both last year and this, which really speaks to consistency. [SEP] And I believe consistency is a key factor in building trust with our investors and stakeholders.","7207":"We\u2019ve seen a significant trend towards mobile usage over the last few years, which has coincided with a shift in consumer behavior. [SEP] In terms of monetizing time spent, it\u2019s certainly the case that consumers have shifted to mobile and businesses need to catch up. [SEP] Our team has been working hard to develop new strategies for mobile advertising to ensure that our clients can effectively reach their target audience on mobile devices.","7208":"We remain committed to our mission of providing the best possible service to our customers. [SEP] But when you're running an operation and serving people at this scale, I think you have a responsibility to invest in all these things that are downstream that could help shape and improve people's lives, because I don't think that there are that many other folks in the world who will. [SEP] That's why we've made significant investments in things like renewable energy, social initiatives, and community programs.","7209":"We have identified a key area of opportunity for growth in our business. [SEP] And so you can bet that we're pulling that string. [SEP] We have already begun implementing strategies to capitalize on this opportunity, and are confident in our ability to see positive results.","7210":"We are constantly exploring ways to improve our efficiency and effectiveness in moderating content within our platform. [SEP] AI tools over time will be able to do a better job of flagging things for the set of people who are in the Community Ops teams that we can prioritize what we look at. [SEP] This is just one example of how we are utilizing technology to support our Community Ops teams and ensure that we are providing a safe and welcoming environment for our users. As we continue to invest in AI tools, we believe we will see even more opportunities to enhance our moderation efforts.","7211":"During the past quarter, we have seen a significant increase in our revenue compared to the same period last year. [SEP] We had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada, so that was part of the growth. [SEP] Additionally, our team has been working hard on expanding our product line and entering new markets, which has contributed to our overall growth.","7212":"During this quarter, we have been focused on driving revenue growth and improving our profitability. One of the primary ways we aim to achieve this is through improving the fees charged to our sellers. [SEP] So we will always be evolving that, part of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes, adding new fees or subtracting old ones, part of it involves raising or lowering fees that sellers pay. [SEP] Our research and analysis indicate that changes to our fee structures have been well-received by our seller community. We will continue to monitor feedback and adjust our fees as needed to ensure a competitive and sustainable marketplace. Ultimately, we are committed to providing our sellers with a low-cost, high-value platform that meets their evolving needs.","7213":"We have seen steady growth in our revenue in this particular market. [SEP] We like our position in it. [SEP] Our team is continuing to explore ways to expand our presence and offerings within the market to capitalize on this positive trend.","7214":"Thank you for joining us for our earnings conference call. Today we're going to be discussing our financial results for the quarter and also providing some updates on our business strategies going forward. [SEP] I mean that is absolutely the fact, case, that is we are seeing a much faster adoption cycle, obviously starting with the consumer side but even the 8 million business PCs that are already running Windows 10 before we have started in fact the push on enterprise. [SEP] This rapid adoption of Windows 10 gives us confidence that our strategy of focusing on cloud-enabled devices and services is the right one. We believe that as more and more businesses move to Windows 10 and embrace cloud computing, we'll see strong growth in our Azure and Office products as well. Overall, we're very pleased with the progress we've made and excited about the opportunities ahead.","7215":"While the past year has been challenging, we are pleased with the progress we have made as a company. [SEP] So over the very long run, I think we remain very optimistic about the growth opportunities we have. [SEP] As we look to the future, we plan to continue investing in research and development to stay at the forefront of our industry.","7216":"Our investments in infrastructure and technology have been key to our growth. [SEP] CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014 and grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. [SEP] We anticipate continued robust CapEx spending in the coming year as we pursue strategic initiatives to support our long-term goals.","7217":"Our financial results for this quarter have been strong, with revenue up by 10% compared to the same period last year. [SEP] But we're also making investments to support the core growth of the business.

As you all know, content is at the core of our business and we remain committed to delivering the best possible experience for our users. [SEP] So in terms of news and different kinds of content, I know this has traditionally been something that we've delivered a really good experience for in terms of people being able to share the content that they want, being able to get access to the content that they want, different recommendations from friends, and we've a lot more coming there, including some new updates to our recommendation algorithm that we believe will really help surface the content that people are most interested in. But beyond just the content itself, we're also focusing on ways to enhance the overall viewing experience for our users. [SEP] We're investing heavily in improving our user interface, making it easier for people to find the content they love. We're also testing new interactive features, which we believe will make watching videos on our platform even more engaging. Overall, we're confident that these initiatives will help us increase viewer engagement and ultimately drive revenue growth.","7220":"As we look at the trends in the market, we can clearly see that traditional cable and satellite TV services are losing ground.

We are confident that this innovation will drive significant growth for our company in the coming quarters.","7223":"Our user base has continued to grow steadily over the past quarter, with more and more people turning to our platform for their entertainment needs.

[SEP] We're also seeing a higher stock-based compensation expense. [SEP] Despite the increase in stock-based compensation expense, we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering strong financial performance in the coming quarters.","7225":"In terms of our sales, we saw a strong start to the year in Q1. [SEP] We had some \u2013we think some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year. [SEP] However, we anticipate that the impact of the pre-buys will subside in the upcoming quarters.","7226":"Thank you for the question. Moving on to our projections for the upcoming year. [SEP] So in terms of the deceleration, we continue to expect deceleration into 2020, but it would be, we believe, more moderated and the reasons for that, that we expect the deceleration. [SEP] Overall, we remain confident in our ability to navigate any further deceleration and continue to drive growth in our core businesses.","7227":"We've had a strong quarter and are looking forward to capitalizing on our momentum as we move into the second half of the year.

We are confident that our expanded capabilities will help us continue to deliver strong financial results in the months ahead.","7228":"In response to a question about the company's plans for LinkedIn.

[SEP] Our marketing team has been working hard to expand our reach and introduce our annuities to new customers.","7231":"Our inventory management strategy has been a key driver of our success over the past few quarters. By carefully analyzing customer demand and our own supply chain capabilities, we've been able to increase our inventory levels while avoiding excess stock and markdowns. [SEP] And we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and to continue to grow inventory in that way. [SEP] Of course, the global supply chain disruptions we're seeing due to Covid-19 are a challenge to our inventory management efforts. We're working closely with our suppliers and logistics partners to mitigate these challenges and ensure we can continue to deliver high-quality products to our customers. Despite these challenges, we remain optimistic about our ability to grow our inventory and serve our customers' needs.","7232":"Our company is committed to staying ahead of the competition and providing the best possible experience for our users.

[SEP] Additionally, our team has been working around the clock to ensure that this product meets all of our high standards before its launch date.","7237":"I just wanted to touch on our advertising strategy for a moment.

[SEP] We understand that user experience is critical to our success, and we are constantly evaluating and tweaking our methods to ensure that we strike the right balance between advertising and user experience.","7238":"Now, let's turn to our mobile gaming business.

[SEP] We're pleased to report that Minecraft on mobile experienced strong user growth and is generating significant revenue.","7239":"Let's take a look at our iPhone sales over the past year.

[SEP] However, we are proud to report that we have successfully navigated these challenges and continue to see strong demand for our iPhone products.

[SEP] We are seeing adoption in the building of new front ends, back ends for new front ends, so essentially using Azure as the cloud back end for their mobile apps across Android, iOS, and Windows as well as their web.

We expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters, and we remain committed to investing in our cloud services to meet this growing demand.","7254":"We take user privacy very seriously, which is why we have been working on improving our end-to-end encryption system. [SEP] Because there are really important safety and content issues in messaging and if we don\u2019t have the ability to see the content, we need to make sure we have different tools in place to handle that.

And in the long-term, we're exploring potential acquisitions to enhance our product offerings and capabilities.","7258":"Our marketing team has been exploring new ways to reach new audiences and increase brand awareness.

I want to address some of those concerns now. [SEP] I think what you're asking is specifically for a transactional component when the old transactional component has gone.

[SEP] We think about it in the combination of Office 365, Dynamics, EMS, because really it's one cloud infrastructure first of all from a capital perspective that sort of serves all of these and there's a virtuous cycle between all of these for our customers as well. [SEP] So it sounds like the idea is to create this kind of ecosystem where customers can access everything they need from one cloud-based infrastructure. Is that right?\"\n- \"I can definitely see how bundling these services together could create more value for customers. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this.","7262":"Our latest research shows that there has been a significant increase in the number of people accessing our online services over the past quarter. [SEP] And the research there is very clear that when people are using the Internet, and including our services, to interact with other people, that's associated with all the positive elements of well-being that you'd expect: feeling more connected, feeling less lonely, feeling happier, and long-term measures of health but when you're simply using the Internet to passively consume content that isn't necessarily associated with positive improvements to well-being. [SEP] We are constantly striving to improve the user experience on our platform, ensuring that our users are engaged in meaningful interactions with others and are not just passively scrolling through content.","7263":"Investor: Can you speak to the sustainability of the company's growth?\n\nResponse: Sure, I can address that.

[SEP] There are two broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. [SEP] The first set of improvements centers around our internal systems and processes. We need to streamline and automate as much as possible to increase efficiency and reduce costs. The second set of improvements relates to our customer-facing operations. We need to enhance our products and services to better meet the needs and preferences of our customers. Overall, making these improvements will position us for continued growth and success.","7266":"Thank you for your question about the current state of our business. [SEP] We aren't seeing a cause for concern. [SEP] Our sales figures remain strong and we believe we are well positioned for future growth.","7267":"We've received questions from investors about our outlook for the upcoming quarters. [SEP] But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continue to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change outside of that component we discussed. [SEP] However, we do anticipate some headwinds in the next quarter due to increased competition in the market.","7268":"We have our next question from the line of John Smith. [SEP] So that's where if you think about the thing that Amy and I focus a lot on is the capital efficiency end-to-end in that context versus getting caught up in even the capital efficiency as measured by any one of these individual pieces, because we think that's what Microsoft's uniqueness long term lies. [SEP] Thank you for your question John, I hope that helps answer your concerns about our approach to capital efficiency.","7269":"Our company strives to understand the ever-changing movement of people in order to provide the best possible products and services. [SEP] People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. [SEP] In response to this trend, we are developing new transportation solutions such as ride-sharing and electric bikes to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","7270":"Our mobile app development platform has been an area of significant focus for us this quarter. [SEP] That's where we have pretty unparalleled value, which is we have Visual Studio Online and some of the tools I talked about, so you can generate these apps at a low cost of ownership, manage them, secure them, and deploy them to our phone endpoints, and then of course, management and security. [SEP] We're seeing great traction with our customers who are looking to quickly and efficiently deploy customized apps to their employees.\"\n\n\"So not only are we offering end-to-end app development capabilities, but we're also providing a comprehensive suite of management and security tools to ensure that our customers can easily maintain and protect their app ecosystem,\" added the CEO.","7271":"Now let's move on to our customer acquisition efforts. [SEP] We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw, our highest ever recorded. [SEP] This is a solid reflection of our marketing strategy and product offerings.","7272":"We are thrilled to report another strong quarter of growth in our commercial business. [SEP] The opportunity for us across what the cloud makes possible for our commercial business and this moment in time that I am a believer in of where companies are going to change their businesses to rely more deeply on technology than they ever have. [SEP] Our team is working hard to capitalize on this trend and ensure that we are well-positioned to provide our customers with the most advanced cloud solutions in the market.","7273":"Our overall revenue for this quarter was $1.5 billion, which is a 5% increase from the same period last year. [SEP] So that clearly is having an impact in APAC and India was our strongest growth market. [SEP] Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the growth potential in these markets and are investing in expanding our operations and workforce to support this growth.","7274":"We're really excited about the potential for our new gaming platform. [SEP] I mean there are a lot of communities that can get that -- people who really care about gaming. [SEP] And with our targeted marketing campaigns, we're confident we can reach these communities and see significant growth in our user base.","7275":"We've seen tremendous growth in our cloud services division. [SEP] And in the last year, we just added more focus and we put more selling capacity around it, more marketing capacity, and now for the mainstream that's across Microsoft [SEP] Our strategy has paid off as we've seen a significant increase in revenue from these efforts.","7276":"We can now take questions from our investors on the earnings call. [SEP] And just to add quickly, I mean, Stories on Facebook is growing quickly. [SEP] Our advertising revenue has also seen steady growth this quarter.","7277":"Our main goal is to prioritize the privacy and security of our users above all else. As part of our efforts to make our messaging platform more secure and reliable, we have made significant investments in our infrastructure. [SEP] We want to make it so that the infrastructure that these services are built on is the most secure and most reliable and fastest and most widely available of any of the major messaging platforms out there, we think that that\u2019s the foundation to build a successful private platform on. [SEP] We are also exploring ways to improve the user experience by incorporating new features and functionalities. We are confident that these initiatives will help us achieve our goal of becoming the leading private messaging platform in the market. Ultimately, we believe that our commitment to security, reliability, and innovation will allow us to deliver significant value to our shareholders and customers.","7278":"We've continued to see strong growth in our cloud business, particularly with Azure. Azure revenue grew 62% year-over-year in the quarter, driving the overall growth in our Intelligent Cloud segment. [SEP] And it turns out that we have ISVs in many cases driving new applications on top of Azure. [SEP] These new applications range from healthcare to financial services to retail. ISVs are drawn to Azure because of its flexibility, security, and scalability. We're thrilled to see the innovation and growth that our ISV partners are driving on our platform.","7279":"Can you give us an update on your latest product releases? [SEP] As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability. [SEP] How has the market responded to this new feature?","7280":"In terms of measuring user engagement and satisfaction on our platform, we use a variety of methods. One of the key ways we assess this is through surveys and feedback from our users. [SEP] We also do a lot of qualitative surveys to see what people, what makes \u2013 what people write in that they want to see from us, what people tell us is the most important thing that they saw in Facebook today or saw anywhere in the world today and what they would've wanted to have seen on Facebook. [SEP] This helps us understand what types of content and features are most valuable to our users, and enables us to make informed decisions about how to enhance the user experience on Facebook. From these surveys, we have discovered a number of key insights that have informed our product development strategy over time. We remain committed to soliciting feedback from our users regularly and using that feedback to further improve our platform.","7281":"We have developed a strategic plan for growth in the next fiscal year. [SEP] We will raise debt both in the U.S. and outside of the United States. [SEP] This will allow us to invest more in research and development for innovative products.","7282":"Our company has been adapting to the changes in the market to remain competitive. [SEP] And then as you might imagine, that provides an interesting environment for us to add on some of the products actually that Satya mentioned very directly in his comments such as EMS or Enterprise Mobility Suite. [SEP] We have already started to see positive results from implementing EMS and we are excited about its potential for growth.","7283":"In fact, our sales in the assistant-enabled category have grown substantially year over year. [SEP] And so it's very large and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assistant enabled devices than probably anyone out there. [SEP] Moving forward, we are continuing to invest heavily in this category, with plans to expand our product line and improve our technology to stay ahead of the competition.","7284":"I'd like to touch on one of our exciting new innovations that's been getting a lot of attention lately. [SEP] When you have Skype translate when two people are talking two different languages and are able to automatically translate without between languages, it's using a deep neural net pens bring together speech synthesis, speech recognition and machine translation with Skype data, that is fairly magical. [SEP] And with its potential to break down language barriers, we believe Skype translate will continue to revolutionize how we communicate with people from all over the world.","7285":"Looking at our revenue and customer data, we've noticed a couple of interesting trends in the market. One of the trends is... [SEP] So those are the two trends we're seeing. [SEP] We plan to continue monitoring these trends closely and adjust our strategy accordingly. In the meantime, we're also exploring new opportunities that align with these trends, such as expanding our product offerings in certain areas.","7286":"We have seen strong growth in both India and China, and we are excited about the potential for continued expansion in these markets. However, as we have delved deeper into our operations in each country, we have noticed some key differences that are worth discussing. [SEP] So that\u2019s probably the biggest difference that we see between India and China. [SEP] Despite these differences, we remain committed to both markets and are actively exploring ways to optimize our operations and capitalize on the unique strengths of each country. We believe that with the right approach, we can achieve sustained growth and profitability in both India and China over the long term.","7287":"Thank you for your question. As you know, we are always striving to drive growth and improve profitability for our shareholders. [SEP] And so I feel really good about where we are, and you can hopefully tell with the strong guidance that we provided, that we\u2019re very bullish on the current quarter as well. [SEP] Additionally, we are optimistic about the long-term prospects of our industry, and we are making strategic investments to position ourselves for continued success. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the next earnings call.","7288":"We are extremely proud of how our team has been able to pivot and adapt during this challenging year. [SEP] And the value as we continue to see in SQL next year I do think there is some opportunity for customers to realize the real value from these hybrid benefits. [SEP] Additionally, we have been investing heavily in our training and development programs to ensure that our employees are equipped to handle the evolving demands of the industry.","7289":"Our Q1 results have exceeded our expectations, and we have a lot to be proud of. We worked tirelessly to innovate and improve our product offerings, and it's paying off. [SEP] I feel really great about it. [SEP] I want to thank all the hardworking staff and executives who made this possible. Let's keep pushing forward and achieving great things.","7290":"Now, moving on to our advertising revenue. As you may know, the advertising industry has been impacted by the pandemic. [SEP] On TV, we are definitely seeing people continue to advertise on TV and use us as a complement. [SEP] However, we have been seeing growth in our digital advertising revenue, particularly in the e-commerce sector.","7291":"Our digital transformation efforts have been a key driver of our success this quarter. [SEP] In fact, if you take Walgreens Boots Alliance, it was Microsoft 365 as well as Azure. [SEP] We have also made significant progress in expanding our e-commerce capabilities and improving our supply chain efficiency.","7292":"Our social media team has been hard at work over the past quarter, leveraging our existing platforms and experimenting with new ones to drive engagement and expand our reach. We're pleased to report that their efforts have been paying off in a big way. [SEP] We hit 200,000 for Instagram, and often the platforms really work together. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a lot of synergy between our various channels. For example, when we post content on Instagram that highlights a product or service, we often see a corresponding increase in traffic on our website and corresponding uptick in sales. It's clear that a multifaceted approach to social media is the way of the future, and we plan to continue investing in these efforts moving forward.","7293":"Now, let's dive into the performance of our various geographic segments. [SEP] So each of the geos did extremely well and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music to iCloud to Apple Pay and more. [SEP] This strong growth is a testament to the dedication and hard work of our teams around the world.","7294":"Can you speak to how you see Facebook's role evolving as people increasingly use it for e-commerce, buying and selling goods, and other transactions? [SEP] But with a strong technological foundation supporting all of these different use cases, the Facebook app has always supported people using all of them. [SEP] And do you see any potential areas for expansion into new use cases in the future?","7295":"The current market conditions are challenging, and we need to adapt to stay competitive. [SEP] So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer, wherever they happen to be. [SEP] This includes exploring new digital channels and expanding our physical presence in key markets.","7296":"During this quarter, we made significant progress in our advertising initiatives. We continued to develop new advertising products and expand our reach into untapped markets. [SEP] We also rolled out ads in Marketplace, which are available in 94 markets, which means advertisers can extend their News Feed ads to Marketplace. [SEP] Our efforts have shown strong results, with overall ad revenue increasing by 25% compared to the same period last year. We plan to continue investing in innovative ad solutions that meet the needs of our users and advertisers alike.","7297":"Our team has been dedicated to enhancing the video capabilities of our products, and we've seen a significant increase in user engagement as a result. [SEP] But what Mark alluded to was video is where people \u2013 as networks improve and devices improve and our products improve, video is the most engaging experience that we can offer. [SEP] We're also exploring new ways to monetize our video content without disrupting the user experience, including sponsored content and targeted advertising. Overall, we're incredibly excited about the potential of video and its role in driving the growth of our business going forward.","7298":"Moving on to the topic of our communication channels. Can you give us an update on how our messaging platforms are performing? [SEP] Messaging, I think, is going to be pretty similar, right? [SEP] Yes, I agree. We haven't seen any major changes in the usage patterns of our messaging channels. However, we are continuing to explore new ways to enhance the user experience and drive engagement.","7299":"In terms of iPhone performance, we saw strength in our iPhone SE and iPhone 11 models, but this was partially offset by softer demand for our higher-end iPhones. [SEP] So during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no iPhone SE units in channel inventory, so we had to do an at least a partial channel fill that obviously had an impact on ASPs. [SEP] However, we are confident in the continued success of our iPhone lineup, and we expect ASPs to improve in the coming quarters as we work to optimize our channel inventory. Additionally, we are exploring new opportunities for growth in emerging markets, where demand for iPhone SE and other mid-range models remains strong.","7300":"Now, let's move on to discussing our company's performance in the cloud infrastructure market. [SEP] Overall what we have seen is the public cloud or cloud infrastructure makes it much more possible for businesses of all sizes and developers of all sizes to get at infrastructure with much less friction than ever before. [SEP] As a result, we have seen significant growth in our cloud infrastructure business and expect this trend to continue in the coming years.","7301":"Moderator: Our next question comes from Mark Smith with ABC Investments. Please go ahead.\n\nMark: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your infrastructure business. How do you see it performing in this competitive landscape? [SEP] Sure, I'll start Mark and having grown up essentially in our infrastructure business at Microsoft, I would say that compared to even the previous eras where we did well in the client server era, in face of tough competition and in this era again in the face of a different set of competitors, we are doing well and we are doing well much better than we did in the previous era because we are seeing these tier 1 workloads which we never saw in the past. [SEP] Moderator: Thank you, Mark. Our next question comes from Sarah Lee with XYZ Financial. Please go ahead.\n\nSarah: Thank you for your presentation. Could you provide some examples of the tier 1 workloads you mentioned earlier and how they have contributed to your success? \n\nMark: Absolutely. One example would be our work with a major healthcare provider to move their critical patient data to the cloud. This was a huge undertaking and required a lot of expertise and support from our team, but it has been a major success and has contributed significantly to our growth in this space.","7302":"We've been working hard over the past few months to expand our product offerings and improve our operations. [SEP] The ops team has done a great job getting us to a position where we are in and I think that\u2019s going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4. [SEP] We anticipate this new service will help increase our revenue and strengthen our relationship with customers.","7303":"Now turning to our expenses for the quarter. [SEP] And we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, and we're seeing the same thing this year. [SEP] However, we remain confident in our ability to manage these expenses while continuing to grow our business.","7304":"Our advertising revenues continue to grow, driven by the strength of our core Facebook platform and our family of apps. Looking ahead, we remain focused on investing in new products and technologies that will further enhance our user experience and drive long-term growth. [SEP] If you're a large company or a small company, you can buy Facebook. [SEP] Furthermore, we're constantly working to improve the effectiveness of our ad targeting capabilities, which has been a major driver of our success. With our massive user base and sophisticated data analytics capabilities, Facebook is an ideal platform for businesses of all sizes to reach their target audiences and drive sales.","7305":"We've talked a lot about our monthly active users and the growth we've experienced over the past quarter. [SEP] And I think the best proxy for you really beyond any numbers we talk about in terms of monthly active is our capital, so the more capital-efficient we can be, the better we're doing. [SEP] That being said, we're always looking for ways to streamline our operations and decrease costs, which will ultimately benefit our shareholders.","7306":"As we continue to expand our technological capabilities, we've been closely monitoring our workforce needs. [SEP] There's a lot of movement of tech head count. [SEP] We've also implemented new recruitment strategies to attract top talent in the industry.","7307":"I'd now like to turn to our iPhone sales, which continue to be a key driver of growth for our company. [SEP] The ramp for iPhone X is going well, especially considering that iPhone X is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created and it has lots of new technologies in it. [SEP] We're seeing strong demand for iPhone X in all of our key markets and are working hard to ramp up production to meet that demand.","7308":"We are pleased to report that our company has experienced considerable growth over the past quarter. [SEP] To grow on a base that big, that kind of rate, you really need pretty strong performance across the board. [SEP] We've seen particularly strong performance in our online sales, with a significant increase in website traffic and conversion rates.","7309":"We're now going to turn to our sales growth over the past quarter. [SEP] So just to put numbers on that, the year-over-year in the U.S. or in North America was 32% growth, which was up from 28% in Q4. [SEP] This growth was driven by strong demand for our products, as well as successful marketing campaigns targeted towards our key demographics.","7310":"As we've previously shared, our cybersecurity team has been monitoring and responding to a sharp increase in attempted cyber attacks against our company over the past few months. These attacks have been coming from a variety of sources and we've identified several patterns. [SEP] We've seen similar types of attempts from Iran, China and some places, others as well. [SEP] We've been working closely with law enforcement and government agencies to identify the specific actors behind these attacks and to implement additional security measures to prevent future breaches. We want to assure our customers that we take their privacy and security very seriously and are doing everything in our power to protect their data.","7311":"Our next question comes from the line of [analyst name] from [firm name]. [SEP] At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments, which Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time picking markets and making sure we execute in them. [SEP] And so, as we look forward, we're very focused on how we continue to grow that market share and grow that TAM [total addressable market]. Again, not just in one vertical or geography, but broadly within the tech industry. So, we're very excited about the opportunities ahead of us.","7312":"Overall, we are pleased with our earnings this quarter and I am happy to report that our margins have increased year-over-year. [SEP] Mark, as I talked a bit about, we've seen a mix shift as we have moved Office 365 and Azure to our premium service and to premium SKUs within our cloud environment, that is one of the drivers that helps improve margin growth. [SEP] Additionally, we have also made improvements in our operational efficiencies which have contributed to our margin growth. Looking ahead, we expect this trend to continue as we invest in our high-growth areas and focus on delivering value to our customers. Thank you all for joining us today.","7313":"We have invested heavily in developing AI tools to help streamline our content analysis processes. [SEP] Now, one of the things that I think is going to be interesting, and in some cases a little frustrating, is that AI tools lend themselves towards identifying certain content a lot more easily than others. [SEP] However, we are aware of this limitation and are constantly working to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of our AI algorithms.","7314":"We have been investing heavily in talent to support our growth strategy and have been successful in attracting top talent in the industry. [SEP] We did see a big jump in head count in year-over-year. [SEP] This has resulted in increased productivity across all departments and has positioned us well for future success.","7315":"During the quarter, we have been focusing on enhancing our digital communication capabilities in order to connect with our customers in an efficient and secure way. As we continue to shift toward a more digital world, we recognize the importance of utilizing messaging tools for communication with our customers. [SEP] One of the challenges in retail and in many other industries is what's that messaging tool that has actually got the security framework that they expect of any other enterprise tool as opposed to using one of these consumer messaging tools, which then all the liability is with the enterprise. [SEP] To address this challenge, we have partnered with a secure enterprise messaging provider that meets all of our security and compliance standards. This has not only increased our efficiency in communication but also reduced our liability as an enterprise. Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize secure communication channels to protect both our customers and our business.","7316":"Our Q2 earnings report shows positive growth across our various platforms and products. We continue to invest in innovation and user experience in order to drive engagement and revenue. [SEP] And that includes the Facebook mobile app, where we saw good year-over-year growth in time spent per DAU [SEP] Looking ahead, we are focused on expanding our user base and diversifying our revenue streams. We plan to launch several new features and products in the coming quarters and are excited about their potential to drive growth. Thank you for your continued support and investment in our company.","7317":"Now let's take a closer look at our earnings for the past quarter. [SEP] And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there. [SEP] Despite the challenges, we were able to maintain steady growth and are optimistic about our future prospects.","7318":"We've seen great progress over the last quarter. [SEP] So we're in the middle of the journey here. [SEP] But we still have a lot of work to do to achieve our long-term goals.","7319":"Now let's take a closer look at our financials for this quarter. [SEP] If you look at the gross margin, it dropped from 86% to 84%. [SEP] This can be attributed to the increase in production costs due to the implementation of new manufacturing processes.","7320":"We've had a great year in terms of revenue growth and profitability, thanks to our strong product portfolio and expanding customer base. [SEP] And then finally, the last point that we've taken into account is what Tim's talked about in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic level in some emerging markets where clearly consumer confidence is not as high as it was 12 months ago. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy and believe we can navigate the current economic climate by focusing on operational efficiency and innovation. We will continue to closely monitor the situation in these markets and adjust our strategies accordingly.","7321":"In terms of customer behavior, we've been closely monitoring our sales and payment data to identify any emerging trends. [SEP] What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. [SEP] Namely, customers tend to start small with their purchases and payments, but gradually ramp up spending as they become more comfortable with our products and services.","7322":"Can you tell us about any upcoming features or updates for WhatsApp? [SEP] We don't have that rolled out in WhatsApp. [SEP] However, we are currently exploring the possibility of implementing it in the future.","7323":"Our social media team has been closely monitoring the trends and engagement on Instagram. [SEP] On the first, when we think about Instagram, we think we have a great opportunity [SEP] We have seen a significant uptick in user adoption and usage since our last earnings call, and we believe there is even more room for growth.","7324":"Our earnings report for this quarter shows strong growth in our advertising revenue and we are pleased with the results. [SEP] I think specifically on the advertising side and the opportunity with that, we are continuing to see some increased adoption. [SEP] We have also invested in new technologies and partnerships to enhance the effectiveness of our advertising platform and to better target our audiences.","7325":"Our focus on small and medium-sized businesses has been a key driver of our revenue growth over the past year. We have seen strong demand for our advertising products from this sector of the market. [SEP] On SMBs, I think it's one of the most compelling opportunities we have for Facebook [SEP] We are continuing to invest in tools and features that will make it easier for SMBs to advertise on our platform. We believe that by helping these businesses grow, we can create long-term, sustainable value for Facebook and our shareholders.","7326":"We're now going to open the floor for questions, so please go ahead if you have any.\n- Our next topic of discussion is the performance of our advertising revenue for the quarter.\n- I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the hard work of our employees for their dedication during this challenging time. [SEP] Yeah, and on video, we're excited about people sharing all different kinds of content on Facebook. [SEP] We recognize there are still improvements that need to be made in terms of content moderation and privacy concerns, but we're confident in our team's ability to address these issues.\n- As we continue to invest in our video capabilities, we're also exploring new monetization opportunities that will benefit creators and advertisers alike.\n- That being said, we understand the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem on our platform, which is why we're committed to providing our users with a safe and enjoyable experience.","7327":"Our new advertising strategy has been highly effective in reaching our target audience and driving engagement. We've seen a significant increase in both click-through rates and conversions. [SEP] It also really takes people further down the funnel from seeing an ad to having a direct connection with businesses, which consumers like and businesses like. [SEP] This approach has not only benefited our company, but it has also helped small businesses thrive. By providing a direct connection between consumers and businesses, we are able to support our local communities and help them grow. We are committed to continuing to enhance our advertising technology to better serve both consumers and businesses.","7328":"Our company has continued to see growth in our technology and services sectors in recent months. [SEP] And that drives a lot of the higher level services, in particular our data services as well as our AI services when AI services are essentially compute, but what happens is all this compute then requires storage and data, and that\u2019s another place where we see increasing acceleration. [SEP] As we continue to expand our offerings in these areas, we expect to see even greater demand for our data and AI services in the coming years.","7329":"During the quarter, our company saw strong growth in our smartphone sales. We are pleased to share that our flagship model, the iPhone X, was a significant driver of this growth. [SEP] And as I\u2019ve mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top five selling smartphones in urban China were all iPhones. [SEP] This trend is not limited to just China, as we are seeing strong demand for our iPhones in other key markets such as Japan and the United States. We believe that our commitment to innovation and quality is driving this popularity and we will continue to invest in these areas to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","7330":"We've received questions about how to best reach our target audience on social media. [SEP] But it is easier and free to start a Facebook page until you see broad adoption. [SEP] However, we believe that investing in social media advertising will ultimately lead to stronger engagement and conversions.","7331":"Now I'd like to discuss our hiring strategy for the quarter. [SEP] We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices. [SEP] These areas have been driving significant growth for us and we feel that investing in additional sales reps will allow us to further capitalize on these opportunities.","7332":"We have a diverse portfolio of products and services that cater to various industries. Our revenue streams come from multiple sectors, including healthcare, finance, technology, and retail. [SEP] so no one vertical drives our business. [SEP] This approach helps us minimize the impact of economic fluctuations in any one vertical. It also gives us the flexibility to adjust our strategy and allocate resources as needed based on market trends and customer needs.","7333":"Our team has been working hard to introduce new iPhone models to the market, and we are excited about their reception among consumers. However, with any new product introduction, we must carefully manage our inventory levels to ensure we are meeting demand without creating excess supply. [SEP] And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically. [SEP] We anticipate that this decline in ASPs will be temporary and that our pricing strategies, combined with strong demand for our products, will allow us to maintain healthy margins in the long term. Additionally, we are focused on optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing processes to reduce costs and improve efficiency across the board.","7334":"We've seen tremendous growth in our sales in China over the past year. [SEP] We're very committed to China as a market. [SEP] We're currently exploring opportunities to expand our operations in the country and increase our presence there.","7335":"Can you give us an update on average revenue per user (ARPU) in your Services business? [SEP] We've got multiple categories in the Services business, so it's difficult to talk about ARPU in general. [SEP] However, I can break down the ARPU for our streaming service and our cloud storage service separately if that would be helpful.","7336":"We are seeing tremendous growth in our cloud computing division. [SEP] And then that\u2019s all just on Azure. [SEP] Additionally, we are continuing to invest in expanding our data center infrastructure to support this growth.","7337":"We continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure and services to support the growing demands of our customers. [SEP] A lot of what we do even in Windows, mostly people don't recognize it, but one of the most important services we run is Windows Update as a cloud service. [SEP] Windows Update delivers critical security and feature updates to over a billion devices worldwide, enabling our customers to stay up to date and secure. We remain committed to providing reliable and efficient cloud-based services to our customers.","7338":"We have received feedback from our customers expressing concerns over the security of our platform. [SEP] I think moving more towards end-to-end encryption and improving security there is the right direction to go in. [SEP] We have already begun investing in new technologies and hiring additional security experts to ensure the safest and most secure experience for our users.","7339":"When discussing our financial performance this quarter, I have to admit that I am feeling good about where we stand. [SEP] I don\u2019t show much joy, but I am happy. [SEP] Of course, there is always room for improvement, but I am confident in our team's abilities to continue to grow and succeed.","7340":"We have been closely monitoring the performance of our different markets. [SEP] In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see. [SEP] We will be implementing new strategies to address this issue and stimulate growth in these markets.","7341":"The CEO was asked about the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China and how it might impact their business. \n\n\"I think it's important to remember that our company operates on a global scale and we have operations in both the United States and China,\" the CEO began. \"We believe that there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together. [SEP] because there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together, that each country can only prosper if the other does and of course the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper for the world to do well.

[SEP] And so some of that weakness frankly is in the non-annuity and very transactional business, which happened to impact Windows Server a bit more than other workloads. [SEP] However, our annuity business continues to show strength and growth, which gives us confidence moving forward.","7493":"I'd like to touch on our approach to regulatory compliance and privacy. [SEP] Certainly, regulation is always an area of focus that we work hard to make sure that we are explaining our business clearly and making sure regulators know the steps we take to protect privacy as well as making sure that we're in compliance. [SEP] We are committed to maintaining transparency with regulators and continuously improving our practices to ensure the safety and privacy of our users.","7494":"Now let's turn to our growth strategy for the upcoming year.

[SEP] Our research shows that users are migrating towards more visual and interactive forms of content, and we believe that investing in features such as Stories will help us stay ahead of the curve.","7503":"Now I'll turn it over to our CFO to discuss the financials for the quarter. [SEP] We improved as we thought we would from the previous quarters a little more than I thought we would. [SEP] Overall, we are pleased with our performance and look forward to building on this momentum going forward.","7504":"During the past quarter, we experienced a deceleration in our unit growth rate. [SEP] And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric. [SEP] However, we want to emphasize that this deceleration is not representative of our overall business performance, as we continue to make significant gains in key areas such as subscription services and AWS.","7505":"One of the things we're really excited about is the potential for end-to-end encryption on Messenger and Instagram.

[SEP] Do you have any data on the success rate of click-to-Messenger ads compared to other types of digital advertising?","7507":"As we look ahead to the next quarter and beyond, there are a few key factors that we must consider. First and foremost is the regulatory landscape. The changes happening at the federal and state level could have a significant impact on our business. [SEP] And that's the three factors that I cited, the regulatory landscape, potential platform changes and then the adoption of our own products like OFA that we're just rolling out now. [SEP] We're confident that we have a strong team in place and the right strategy to navigate these challenges. Our focus is on staying agile and continuing to innovate, particularly when it comes to our own products like OFA. We believe that this will be a key driver of growth for us in the years to come.","7508":"In terms of our product offering, we are always looking for ways to expand and diversify.

[SEP] As a result, we saw a significant increase in customer engagement and sales on our online platform.","7509":"We have a strong focus on our company's mission and values in everything we do.

[SEP] For sellers, it means they sell more. [SEP] We anticipate continued growth in our seller base as a result of this positive trend.","7513":"We have had a very strong quarter with impressive revenue growth and improved profitability. Our team has done an excellent job in executing on our strategic plan and delivering value to our customers. [SEP] And clearly, we will want to continue to offer new services over time, so there are a number of vectors that allow us to continue to grow the business over time. [SEP] One particular area of focus for us will be expanding our presence in international markets and exploring strategic partnerships with companies that offer complementary services. Additionally, we will be investing in research and development to bring innovative solutions to market and stay ahead of industry trends.","7514":"We've been experimenting with various ways to monetize our platform and have made some progress in recent months. As we've mentioned before, we believe advertising offers a promising avenue for generating revenue, and we've been conducting some initial tests in this area. [SEP] One is we're starting to put some ads into the product just to see the basic parameters around how that performs, how people like the ads or don't, how they work for businesses, and just try to get an understanding of that. [SEP] So far, the results have been mixed, but we're encouraged by some of the metrics we're seeing. We've also received some feedback from our users about the ads, which has been helpful in refining our approach. We'll continue to iterate on this and explore other opportunities for monetization as we aim to build a sustainable business over the long term.","7515":"Our e-commerce business is a key driver of growth for us, and we are constantly evaluating ways to improve our fulfillment and delivery capabilities.

We've seen some great engagement from users who are passionate about specific topics, whether it's cooking, fitness, or gaming. We believe this is a key area of growth for our company, and we're actively exploring new ways to foster these communities within our apps.\n\nOverall, we remain committed to investing in our family of apps to meet the evolving needs of our users. We're confident that our continued focus on social sharing and community building will drive long-term growth and success for our business.","7521":"We have seen tremendous success in our user engagement metrics this quarter.

[SEP] There are differences in migration patterns that will make any quarter-to-quarter movements lumpy, as I said. [SEP] However, over a longer period of time, we expect to see a more consistent trend in migration patterns based on our internal data and market research.","7526":"There have been rumors circulating that Qualcomm has made an offer to Apple to renew their licensing agreement.

[SEP] Overall, our goal is to provide our customers with a range of flexible and scalable options that meet their specific needs and help them achieve their business goals.","7535":"A competitor recently released sales figures that showed they outperformed us. [SEP] Our own data would look better than that. [SEP] However, after reviewing the data and conducting our own analysis, we have determined that our own data would look better than that.","7536":"We have seen a significant shift towards cloud adoption in the past few years. [SEP] But to your point, Raimo, I think what has happened is the change, even in the financial services, the segments that you all represent, the kinds of workloads now that are moving to the cloud has qualitatively changed. [SEP] This shift towards cloud adoption has accelerated due to the pandemic as more companies are embracing digital transformation.","7537":"We have seen a significant shift towards cloud-based solutions in the past year.

Can you talk a bit about your strategy around video content? \n\nResponse: Sure, happy to. [SEP] On the video question, we're basically focused primarily on video on our own site and service, and video tends to be pretty short form content right now on Facebook because it's playing in News Feed. [SEP] We do see longer-form video gaining traction on Facebook Watch, but for now, our main focus is on creating engaging, shorter-form videos that work well in the News Feed. As we continue to expand our video offerings, we'll be exploring more ways to incorporate longer-form content into our platform.","7542":"Now let's turn our attention to our privacy and security initiatives. [SEP] So when I first announced that we were going to be moving our private communication services to all be end-to-end encrypted, I was very clear that we\u2019re planning on taking at least a year to go consult with experts and governments and law enforcements around the world to make sure that we have the right safety systems in place to make sure that we handle this really well, right?

By focusing on these KPIs, we can get a clear picture of our overall performance and identify areas for improvement.","7544":"Our research shows that the gaming industry is growing rapidly and has great potential.

[SEP] We are also closely monitoring social media platforms and news outlets to ensure that any misinformation or false claims are quickly addressed and corrected.","7549":"We've been working hard to make improvements to our suite of apps, and I'm happy to say that we're seeing positive results. Our users are responding well to the changes we've made, and we're already seeing increased engagement across the board. [SEP] The apps will always continue to have their own identity and brand now because they -- people use them for somewhat different things, and that's really important. [SEP] That said, we are exploring ways to make these apps more interoperable, so users can seamlessly move between them as their needs change. We believe this will be particularly valuable for our business users, who often need to switch between different tools throughout the day.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to create a seamless user experience that caters to a variety of needs. We're committed to investing in research and development to ensure that our suite of apps continues to evolve and meet the changing needs of our users.","7550":"Our social media platform has been performing well in Europe, and I wanted to share some exciting news with our investors.

[SEP] We are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the Q2 guidance and continue our growth trajectory for the rest of the year.","7554":"We've seen great success with our advertising campaigns using carousel ads on social media platforms. Our strategy is to provide personalized content to our target audiences in order to increase engagement and drive sales. [SEP] So the carousel ads, they're not just that they're showing multiple products, it's that they're showing products that are more specifically directed at the person. [SEP] Through our data analysis, we are able to determine what products are of interest to each individual and use that information to showcase those products in the carousel ad. This has led to a significant increase in click-through rates and ultimately, conversions. We plan to continue utilizing this approach in our advertising campaigns moving forward.","7555":"Our quarterly earnings have been impacted by several external factors. We've seen fluctuations in currency exchange rates and there have been changes in privacy regulations that have affected our business.

With these efforts, we're confident we can continue to grow our business and deliver strong results for our shareholders.","7560":"In talking about our overall cloud strategy, it's also important to mention the role that Microsoft Azure plays. [SEP] I think about the Microsoft Cloud because even the way we do capital, the way we measure utilization is all with the complete unit, which is of course all of Office 365 runs on Azure, Azure AD powers all of our Cloud, and even Dynamics 365 runs on Azure infrastructure.

With its sleek design and innovative features, we anticipate strong demand from our customer base.","7564":"Overall, we saw strong performance in our software and services divisions, which partially offset weaker-than-expected hardware sales. However, we did experience some headwinds in the form of rising material costs and competitive pricing pressure.

I think it's one of our key strengths as a company and I look forward to continued collaboration with this incredible team.","7646":"One of the key areas of our growth strategy is strengthening our partnerships with marketing firms. [SEP] Our focus with our marketing partners is their business results. [SEP] By prioritizing their success, we believe we can achieve mutually beneficial outcomes and drive sustainable growth for our business.","7647":"Our company just finished the fourth quarter, and today we will discuss our financial results. We are excited to share that we had a successful quarter with strong sales figures. [SEP] On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top selling smartphone during the quarter. [SEP] This success can be attributed to the strong demand for the iPhone X, which exceeded our expectations. Additionally, our marketing efforts and customer loyalty programs helped drive sales of our other products, including the Apple Watch and iPad. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum we have going into the next quarter.","7648":"We've seen a significant increase in engagement on our social media platforms over the past quarter,\" said the CEO. \"Users are spending more time on our apps and engaging with each other in new ways. [SEP] So this is across the whole family of apps. [SEP] We're continuing to invest in developing new features and improving the user experience across all of our apps,\" the CEO added. \"We believe this will drive further growth and monetization opportunities in the future.","7649":"Our earnings report for this quarter shows a decline in unit sales compared to the same period last year. [SEP] As I've talked in other quarters, it's a number that's excludes AWS subscription services, advertising and Whole Foods, which are some of the fastest growing areas and we also have \u2013 are actively selling subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited, which can cannibalize unit sales. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we remain committed to investing in innovative products and services that meet the evolving needs of our customers.","7650":"Now moving on to our growth strategy for the upcoming year. [SEP] and so the fact that we have so much room to grow is exciting for us. [SEP] We have already identified several opportunities for expansion in new markets and can't wait to see our efforts translate to increased revenue.","7651":"Now let's turn to the performance of our company. [SEP] The overall economy is certainly also quite good, and the installed base had actually gotten older. [SEP] However, we saw some challenges in our sales department due to increased competition.","7652":"Our Cloud business has experienced significant growth over the past year. [SEP] And that's where a lot of the transformation we have done internally is helping us accelerate our Cloud business. [SEP] By streamlining our processes and investing in new technology, we are now better equipped to meet the demands of our customers in this space.","7653":"We've seen tremendous growth in our user base this year and we want to ensure that we can maintain the trust and safety of our platform for all users. [SEP] It's included growing the security and content review teams to 20,000 people to be able to handle the volume of work that we need to do. [SEP] As a result of these investments, we've already seen a significant decrease in the number of reported incidents and have received positive feedback from our community.","7654":"During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our cloud services, with revenue increasing by 15%. Our Office and Dynamics products also continued to do well, with Office 365 adding 9 million subscribers in the last three months. [SEP] I also talked about the 70 million monthly active users of Office. [SEP] Looking ahead, we're excited about the potential for our upcoming release of Microsoft Teams, which we believe will further enhance our collaboration offerings for businesses of all sizes. We also remain committed to investing in research and development to ensure that our products continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","7655":"We've been investing heavily in our infrastructure to support our growing user base. Our engineering team has been working hard to optimize our systems for scalability and reliability. [SEP] And so, while this really is \u2013 the majority of this spend is servers. [SEP] But we're also investing in other areas, such as machine learning and data analysis. Our goal is to continue to improve our product and provide the best possible experience for our users.","7656":"We're excited to see a significant increase in user engagement on our platform. One of the contributing factors has been our efforts to introduce new features that are user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of people. [SEP] They're free, they're easy to set up, and they already know how to do them because almost all of them are already Facebook users in the first place. [SEP] We believe that this will continue to drive growth and attract even more users to our platform in the coming quarters.","7657":"We are currently evaluating the impact of the recent market disruptions on our business operations. [SEP] I mean it reduces our growth rate. [SEP] However, we remain confident that our long-term growth strategy will mitigate any short-term setbacks.","7658":"During the Q&A session, a participant asked about the company's plans for migrating their systems to the cloud. [SEP] That I think the future which is distributed computing going back to what needs to be truly distributed, even driven server-less even versus this thing about let's just have one-time migration to something new. [SEP] I believe that by embracing distributed computing and going server-less, we can achieve true agility and scalability in our infrastructure, rather than just trying to replicate our current setup in the cloud.","7659":"Now let's turn to our revenue streams from our software contracts. [SEP] These are contracts that unless it is used and deployed and a customer gets value from, it does not land into the P&L. [SEP] As such, we are optimistic about our continued growth potential as more customers realize the value of our solutions.","7660":"Moving on to our financial performance for the quarter, I'm pleased to report solid results across the board. [SEP] In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us as it is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double digits over last year during the quarter and so we're thrilled with that and you can see that carrying through to the services line and the growth that we had there. [SEP] Looking ahead, we expect to continue to see strong growth in our services business as our installed base continues to expand and our offerings become even more attractive to our customers.","7661":"During the quarter, we made progress on expanding our messaging capabilities. [SEP] We have a very slow rollout in Messenger. [SEP] However, we are committed to investing in Messenger and expect to see growth in the coming quarters.","7662":"Now, let's turn to our second quarter performance. [SEP] As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. [SEP] This growth was driven by our successful product launches and strong marketing campaigns.","7663":"We have recognized that the community is what makes GitHub successful. [SEP] And so therefore that's why we want to ensure that everything we do and the number one priority for Nat and team at GitHub will be all about maintaining that GitHub community, the ethos around developers at the core. [SEP] We believe that continued investment in the community will benefit both our users and our business in the long term.","7664":"We have seen some positive momentum in user engagement over the past quarter, but we know there is still room for improvement. [SEP] On engagement, John, I think we're obviously focused across a number of different dimensions to drive engagement. [SEP] Some of the initiatives we are putting in place include personalized content recommendations, enhanced social features, and expanded video content.","7665":"We've seen strong growth in our established markets, but we're also looking to expand into new regions. [SEP] But there is certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. [SEP] However, we believe the potential for revenue growth in these new markets outweighs the upfront costs associated with launching operations there.","7666":"We have received a lot of feedback from our customers regarding our latest product release. We are taking their feedback seriously and trying to address their concerns. [SEP] And so we continue to work on that, but not much new to add right now. [SEP] However, I can tell you that our team is dedicated to improving the user experience and we have some exciting plans in the works. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming months.","7667":"Now let's move on to our Q4 results. [SEP] So that was generally very good financially. [SEP] However, our marketing expenses were higher than anticipated and may impact our profitability going forward.","7668":"Moving on to our second topic for today's conference call: industry trends and challenges. [SEP] The second is platform changes as it relates to operating systems and a more of a focus on privacy from the operating systems and the impact that that can have on measurements and also on targeting. [SEP] We believe it's important to stay ahead of these changes and adapt our strategies accordingly to continue delivering value for our clients.","7669":"We've been investing a lot in improving our ad targeting and measurement capabilities. [SEP] It's too early to see any direct impact, but I think it's part of the innovation that you'll see from us as we continue to roll out different ways that marketers can use our tools, different ways they can pay, different results they can target. [SEP] Overall, we're very optimistic about the opportunities this will create for us and our advertisers in the long run.","7670":"Now let's talk about our performance in the last quarter. [SEP] The only transactional weakness I felt in the quarter at all was what we covered, which was the OEM impact from the chip supply, which was about 1.5 points of growth on MPC, and the Office Consumer impact, which was secondary impact of the PC environment plus some execution challenges we had that I feel really good that we've gotten to the root of and will get handled in H2. [SEP] Despite these challenges, we still managed to exceed our revenue target for the quarter. Our team has been working hard to address these issues and we are confident that we will see improved results in the second half of the year.","7671":"We've been investing heavily in our supply chain over the past year, and I'm happy to report that these efforts are starting to pay off. Our fulfillment times have improved significantly, and we're able to deliver products to our customers faster than ever before. [SEP] But in the long run we\u2019re going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that we\u2019ve used in the past. [SEP] Of course, we'll continue to explore opportunities to expand our capacity as needed. This could include investing in new warehouses or distribution centers, or partnering with additional carriers who can help us meet growing demand. But for now, we feel confident in our ability to meet our customers' needs and continue growing our business over the long term.","7672":"Now moving on to our capital allocation strategy. As you know, we've had a strong year in terms of revenue and profits. But we also want to make sure we're making strategic investments for future growth. [SEP] So when I think about even the capital allocation per quarter we very carefully look at what is our current utilization forecast, and what our demand forecast is. [SEP] Based on our analysis, we've decided to allocate more funds towards R&D in the upcoming quarter, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning. We believe this will give us a competitive advantage in the long-term. Of course, we'll continue to monitor our utilization and demand forecasts to ensure we're making the most informed decisions.","7673":"Our company has always been focused on pursuing strategic acquisitions that will enable us to grow and expand our operations. [SEP] And if anything comes up in M&A which allows us to pursue our strategic vision that we will need to even allocate more to on an OpEx basis, post-acquisition we will look at that. [SEP] However, we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to our expenses and ensure that any allocation of resources is in line with our overall financial goals and objectives.","7674":"We've received a lot of feedback from our customers in New York and Los Angeles about their experiences with our products and services. [SEP] So right now, we're working through some next issues in both cities. [SEP] Our goal is to address these issues as quickly and efficiently as possible to continue delivering exceptional value to our customers.","7675":"And to follow up on that question, can you discuss how your PaaS offerings are being received by customers? [SEP] So that's the network effect that we see when it comes to the PaaS services. [SEP] It's been a strong driver of growth for us, and we believe that we're well positioned to continue capturing market share in this area.","7676":"Our revenue growth this quarter was driven largely by our productivity and business processes segment, which saw a 19% increase in revenue year over year. [SEP] And if you think about that, it\u2019s the Windows commercial, it\u2019s Office 365 commercial and EMS. [SEP] We continue to see strong demand for these offerings from both consumer and enterprise customers, and we are confident in our ability to grow our market share in these areas in the coming quarters.","7677":"Now turning to our financial performance for the quarter. [SEP] And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. [SEP] This decision has resulted in strong shareholder returns and we plan to continue this practice going forward.","7678":"We understand that our customers have been experiencing long wait times on our phone lines and have voiced their frustration through social media and customer surveys. [SEP] And so we\u2019re working hard to remedy that. [SEP] We are hiring additional customer service representatives, implementing chatbots and self-service options, and optimizing our call routing system to improve efficiency and reduce wait times.","7679":"Our company is excited to announce some exciting new partnerships and initiatives that we hope will continue to drive growth and innovation in the unmanned aerial vehicle space. [SEP] And we're extremely happy to partner with the UK government to advance the safe use of drones for small parcel delivery. [SEP] We believe that this partnership will not only benefit our company and shareholders, but also contribute to the broader goal of making drone technology more accessible and useful to people around the world.","7680":"Our top priority for the coming year is to drive user engagement and increase our revenue streams.

[SEP] We have recently added new features and integrations to enhance the user experience and we will continue to invest in this area to drive growth.","7681":"Our financial results this quarter demonstrate the continued strength of our business and the demand for AWS services. [SEP] As I talked about earlier, that\u2019s one factor customers save a lot of money, but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move really quickly. [SEP] We will continue to invest in innovation and expanding our capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","7682":"One of the questions we often get asked is how we define our cloud offerings. [SEP] Let me start by saying we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components, from the IaaS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer. [SEP] We believe this comprehensive approach allows us to provide the most flexible and scalable solutions for our customers.","7683":"During the second quarter, our digital marketing team implemented a new advertising strategy to drive more online bookings. [SEP] Celebrity Cruises used these Dynamic Ads for travel on both Facebook and Instagram to increase their online bookings. [SEP] As a result of the Dynamic Ads campaign, we saw a 25% increase in online bookings compared to the same period last year.","7684":"We are constantly evaluating our strategies to ensure we are utilizing the most effective resources. [SEP] That's something you're going to deploy, whether that's EMS, is the best example. [SEP] Our team has conducted extensive research and testing to determine the most beneficial solution for this particular issue.","7685":"We have seen incredible growth in video content on our platform and we believe there is still a lot of potential for us to capture. [SEP] And there's a pretty clear roadmap of stuff that we're going to do over the next couple of years that I'm quite excited about to add some more dimensions to the video experience on Facebook. [SEP] Our team is already hard at work on these initiatives and we look forward to sharing more details with you in the coming months.","7686":"As we analyze our financial performance, it's important to consider some of the factors that may contribute to fluctuations in our gross margin. One of these factors is our product mix. [SEP] Also, the mix of products that we sell into the market tends to change over time, and that also has an impact on the overall gross margin for the company. [SEP] To maintain a healthy gross margin, we continually evaluate the profitability of our product offerings and make adjustments as needed. We anticipate that this ongoing analysis and adjustment process will help us maintain a strong financial position in the years to come.","7687":"We understand that our customers have high expectations of us and we are committed to meeting and exceeding those expectations. [SEP] And this is something that Kevin Turner, myself and Amy and all of our leadership team is very focused on. [SEP] Through our investments in technology and infrastructure, we believe we can deliver an even better experience for our customers and drive growth for our company.","7688":"We're very excited to see a lot of buzz and interest around our new product launches in the last quarter. [SEP] And so that -- when you have that kind of first time buyer rates, you don\u2019t have a saturated market. [SEP] In fact, we've seen a steady increase in our first time buyer rates over the past few months, which is a great indication of growth potential for our business.","7689":"During the past quarter, we achieved record-breaking sales for our latest iPhone models. [SEP] And also that the current iPhone line up experienced the highest Android switcher rate in any of the last three launches in the three previous years. [SEP] We believe this is due to our continued focus on providing a superior user experience and introducing new features that exceed customer expectations.","7690":"Our advertising revenue for this quarter has exceeded our expectations and we are pleased with the results. [SEP] And click to Messenger ads on Facebook are actually very promising as well because advertisers want to see a return for the money they spend. [SEP] We are also exploring new advertising opportunities on other social media platforms to expand our reach and generate even more revenue.","7691":"Now moving on to our financial results for the quarter. [SEP] So we're really happy that our growth has been really strong across our verticals, and that continues to be the case. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to sustain this growth and remain optimistic about the future of our company.","7692":"We continue to focus on improving the user experience while also driving revenue growth. One way we're doing this is through our messaging platform, which has seen significant growth over the past year. [SEP] And we're also in the early days of sponsored messages, which enable businesses to reengage people once a conversation has started. [SEP] Our sponsored messages have already shown promising results in terms of engagement and conversion rates. We believe this will be a key driver of our future revenue growth as more businesses look to leverage our messaging platform for customer outreach.","7693":"Thank you for the question, Shannon. [SEP] Yeah, Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if you look for the cycle, by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid single digit and ASP growth of double digit. [SEP] We believe this demonstrates the strength of our product offerings and our ability to continue to innovate and meet consumer demand.","7694":"We believe that our platform is designed to foster meaningful interactions between people and to help build communities. Our mission has always been to connect people from all over the world and make their lives better. [SEP] And it also follows the well-being research that we've done that suggests that when people use the Internet for interacting with people and building relationships, that is correlated with all of the positive measures of well-being that you just expect like longer term health and happiness, feeling more connected and less lonely, whereas just passively consuming content is not necessarily positive on those dimensions. [SEP] As a company, we are committed to improving the well-being of our users, and we are constantly looking for new ways to make our platform a positive force in people's lives. We believe that our focus on building relationships and fostering meaningful interactions sets us apart from other social media platforms and will continue to be a key driver of our success.","7695":"During the quarter, we launched a new marketing campaign to promote our digital payment solutions.

We've been able to decrease our overall expenses by 15% through streamlining our operations and renegotiating contracts with vendors. [SEP] And so what you can then see, relating to the second half your question, is that we are taking some of those savings and investing them back into the business in some of these key growth areas we've seen. [SEP] Specifically, we're looking to expand our online presence and invest in digital marketing to reach a wider audience. We've also allocated funds to research and develop new product lines that align with consumer trends. We believe these investments will position us for long-term growth and success in the market.","7697":"In terms of our international operations, we faced some challenges this quarter. [SEP] But generally speaking, I see positive vectors there, not negative, in the aggregate. [SEP] Our team is working to address the issues we've identified and we're optimistic about future growth opportunities.","7698":"Our recurring revenue has been a bright spot for us this quarter. We have seen strong growth and stability in that area. [SEP] I expect that to continue, although you will have volatility because what's interesting about that specific metric is, it has a little bit more 606 impact than we\u2019ve felt it's an on-prem product. [SEP] However, we are still monitoring the 606 impact closely and adjusting our strategy accordingly. Overall, we're confident in our ability to navigate through any volatility and continue delivering value to our customers.","7699":"Our revenue for the quarter exceeded our expectations. [SEP] so that's really exciting. [SEP] We are confident in our ability to continue this growth trajectory and exceed our year-end targets.","7700":"As we continue to expand our cloud offerings, we're noticing a trend towards more third-party vendors integrating their products and services with our platform. This includes both proprietary and open source tools. [SEP] At the same time, we're also seeing a lot of open source ISVs also be part of the Azure marketplace. [SEP] This has led to a diverse ecosystem of applications within our Azure marketplace, providing customers with greater choice and flexibility. We're excited to see how this trend continues to evolve and contribute to the growth of our cloud business.","7701":"We've been closely monitoring user behavior across all platforms and have noticed some interesting trends. Our team has been hard at work analyzing the data to find ways to improve the user experience. [SEP] On mobile, it's easier to take videos, so we see more videos. [SEP] As a result of this trend, we're doubling down on our investment in video content. We're currently testing new features to make video creation and sharing even easier for our users. We're excited to see how this will continue to drive engagement on our platform.","7702":"We've seen very strong demand for our products across all categories. Our retail partners are expanding their shelf space to accommodate our growth. [SEP] And then purchasers are happy to continue to add SKUs and add and move up the scale.

[SEP] This was largely driven by the successful launch of our new mobile app and expansion into emerging markets.","7705":"We've been closely monitoring our ad load and making adjustments to ensure a positive user experience.

[SEP] What steps is your company taking to stay ahead of these evolving cloud needs and remain competitive?\" \n\nResponse: \"Absolutely. We're seeing many companies focusing on the lift, shift, and modernize motion, particularly as they try to move legacy applications to the cloud.

[SEP] We're confident that our investment in this area will continue to drive growth and increase shareholder value.","7715":"We experienced a decline in our sales for the quarter, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our key markets were severely impacted by the economic slowdown and lockdown measures implemented by various countries. [SEP] Obviously, that was also a negative.

We also launched a new product line that has shown promising results in early market testing. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic about our prospects for the rest of the year.","7716":"Now, turning to our future growth strategies, I would like to discuss our focus on building an intelligent cloud platform.

[SEP] However, we anticipate ramping up our external hiring efforts in the second half of the year as the market and our business continue to recover.","7718":"In terms of our latest product release, we are very pleased with the response from our customers. The new features and enhancements have been well-received, and we have seen strong adoption rates among those who have upgraded. [SEP] I would point out that only a small fraction of the installed base has upgraded. [SEP] This gives us a significant opportunity to continue driving growth as more users transition to the new version. We will also be investing in targeted marketing efforts to encourage users to upgrade and take advantage of the latest capabilities.","7719":"We saw strong growth in our Japan operation in the last quarter. Our team in Japan has been executing very well and we are optimistic about our prospects in the region. [SEP] Japan as a geography for us is a high transactional market.
