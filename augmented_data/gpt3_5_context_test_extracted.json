{"sentences":{"0":"And the cost of that then gets amortized to those countries.","1":"Two years ago we were down 140 bps.","2":"It's true, as you point out, that the equity markets have recently been volatile.","3":"In terms of overall ad tech world, I think a lot is happening and there's a lot that's going to evolve in the whole ecosystem.","4":"And that is the reason why, again this year, we\u2019re allocating the majority of the increase, which is the largest increase that we\u2019ve ever done, we\u2019re increasing the program by $70 billion.","5":"because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch.","6":"And we want people to be able to share all of the things that are meaningful to them not just the things that are happy and that people are going to like when they see it.","7":"On Facebook, they took that ad and showed it to movie fans, Wizard of Oz fans and also people connected to accessibility causes.","8":"Well, the App Store is growing over 20%, it grew 25% last quarter,","9":"Just really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017, it's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth along with time spent \u2013 user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand.","10":"And if you go beyond that, I feel good about our gaming business sequentially.","11":"We think marketplace is that.","12":"I, for the first time, talked about Cosmos DB.","13":"The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it.","14":"As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter.","15":"In fact, I'm looking forward to our partner conference to talk much more about what it is that we will be doing in the coming year to drive more success for our partners and in particular ISVs.","16":"We had VMware, and we had many other players we competed with and I grew up competing with.","17":"International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be in future quarters there.","18":"But Windows 10 is something that\u2019s completely optimized for the enterprise and across all same sizes for the mobile worker, as well as the desktop and large screens.","19":"So a lot of what is Dynamics field service is actually in our module growth we are seeing because of Azure IoT, and that relationship is not just about Azure PaaS.","20":"We really did see strength across all of them.","21":"So that's core basic messaging, the core functionality around having your real identity and connecting with all of your real friends and family online.","22":"So Air China is a good example.","23":"Of course, right, I mean these are large communities that people love and strongly associate with a specific app.","24":"We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers \u2013 for FBA sellers.","25":"And on the server question you asked at the beginning, let me say that we did see I think around 9% constant currency growth of the core server product, and a lot of that was premium driven.","26":"And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1.","27":"They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter.","28":"The second thing is video.","29":"But there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth so time spent per person.","30":"I mean we think it'll be good for the business over the long-term, but this is what people are telling us is what they want on the product.","31":"So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas things like Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high-end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate or nearly twice that rate based on total headcount.","32":"They are going to be high sometimes and they'll be moderated at other times.","33":"You can buy Audience Network.","34":"We have Facebook Marketplace for that.","35":"I would say that, one, our products aren't simple enough yet, because they can never be simple enough for SMBs, but two, our products are probably the simplest ones out there.","36":"And the vast majority of that we\u2019re allocating to the share repurchase, because again, we believe there\u2019s great value in the stock.","37":"Even the customer examples I gave, they were littered with example after example.","38":"We also expect to continue to invest in marketing and advertising.","39":"Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing.","40":"So that runs the gamut from smart thermostat and another smart home devices, headphones, but also vehicle.","41":"Some of these services are scaling quickly and so we tend to expand gross margins there.","42":"The very best example, frankly, as Satya mentioned in his comments, which is our EMS performance, Enterprise Mobility Suite offerings.","43":"Certainly, with different groups of people, it's stronger on Instagram or WhatsApp or Facebook, but across all three at this point, it's growing.","44":"We have the delivery services \u2013 so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need.","45":"This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are \u2013 Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by \u2013 units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA.","46":"I have to say that it's been remarkable.","47":"I mentioned iCloud, and so it all adds up.","48":"And that was a couple points of impact, for example on OEM Pro in quarter.","49":"I mean, WhatsApp is more of a clear text messaging replacement.","50":"And as I said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report at the March quarter and that will include talking about timeframes and pace and so on.","51":"I think on a recent earnings call we just announced that we passed 1 billion searches total so now being more than 1 billion on mobile shows some progress that I'm pretty proud of for the search team.","52":"But I think in consumer, it\u2019s maybe the easiest one to talk about, is that we talked about license growth of 10%, when you correct for Japan.","53":"For me, what I think is missing in that question is really \u2013 it's not about any one customer saying wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more.","54":"On the question around channel inventory, we entered the quarter, the December quarter -- and we mentioned it back in October below our target range of five to seven weeks.","55":"It's very similar to what happened even in the client server era, but of course the starting points and how this progresses is very different.","56":"Customers save millions.","57":"By running across Facebook Stories and Instagram Stories, they drove 20% more leads than our other digital campaigns.","58":"And also the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter.","59":"But our fulfillment costs per unit actually decreased year-over-year.","60":"My hats off to operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was Christmas in July quite frankly, a bigger day than Black Friday, as we've said and orders increased 266% year-over-year.","61":"And then of course, ads, we've got 60 million businesses with pages.","62":"So you're coming up against a bigger business last year than we had in the past.","63":"But our first priority, every time, is to make sure we are focused on annuity growth and digital transformation at our company, which is best done through that motion.","64":"Same thing on server management, we have a new suite called the Operations Management Suite, which also spans all the cloud units as well as on-premise units.","65":"As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself.","66":"And then the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end.","67":"But a lot of that comparability, which you referenced, is due a little bit of how it's licensed, which is a lot of this is new and gets recognized more upfront in quarter.","68":"As I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in computers, do not provide quarterly unit sales information either.","69":"So if you look even at our announcements over this quarter, a lot of what we have done with IoT is create an IoT edge.","70":"But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply constrained on 7 and 7 Plus.","71":"We have robust device business including the launch of a new Paperwhite Fire TV Echo with general availability and numerous other products that we're very excited about.","72":"We're trying to help them measure.","73":"We continue to have healthy investments as we've stated across the globe.","74":"We are seeing people move more and more of their workflows to AWS and at a faster pace.","75":"The core ethos of LinkedIn needs be about member-first.","76":"It's certainly something we're working on vertical-by-vertical.","77":"The combination of those two things and the opportunity we see is the reason in the sales re-org that we did in July, we continue to put resources and sales resources behind collaboration and communication, and so many of the important workloads that allow us to give great value to customers.","78":"Whereas now with the cloud for the first time we now can serve both individuals as well as small businesses with the same kind of sophistication that in the past was exclusively available for the large enterprises.","79":"I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin improvement across all those services.","80":"As it relates to margin profile, you also just have the factor that you're increasing growth \u2013 the increasing mix of the business is shifting towards Asia and towards what are currently lower ARPU markets.","81":"because there\u2019s different characteristics of Stories versus Feed, because you have effectively rolls of video when people are posting lots of Stories, and the interstitials are in between the rolls.","82":"We do not manage this company quarter to quarter.","83":"because as we look at the usage statistics on iPad, it remains unbelievably great.","84":"It allows them to better tell customers who they are share their story.","85":"One of those is the video content investment.","86":"Obviously, on the safety and security side, those are costs that are layering in that we think are the right thing to do for the business but don't necessarily have a revenue impact.","87":"Today, for the most part, people pull Facebook out when they have a few minutes, when they want to catch up and see what's going on in the world with their friends and in the news and everything that's going on.","88":"It's the same case with Boeing.","89":"That is important in the enterprise and that\u2019s what we are building towards with great management and great security.","90":"And the last quarter we gave an indication of the growth rates after being added for 10 year.","91":"We continue to open retail stores around the world.","92":"And that is not just the case for the aggregate of the growing community, but it's actually also the case on a per-person basis as well in terms of people sharing more and spending more time individually.","93":"I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015 and that was up 40% year-over-year.","94":"It goes without saying strong U.S. dollar has negative impact on our international business.","95":"The better we can do with dealers and with auto manufacturers at measuring all the way through the purchase, the better off we are.","96":"That\u2019s gone through a fee change both because of the hardware innovation, innovation in Windows, innovation in Office.","97":"So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015.","98":"To give you a comparison, when we launched the iPhone, we had about 500 apps that were ready.","99":"But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next \u2013 in the coming year.","100":"There are differences in adoption of the cloud.","101":"They started in Sweden on Facebook.","102":"Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage.","103":"So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment in warehouses.","104":"Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with Air Transport Services Group, an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s there, and similar use case, it's products that are already boxed.","105":"We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals.","106":"That was up 36% year-over-year.","107":"We see what products you use within Facebook or Instagram, or Facebook and Instagram, as less important as the best products for the right marketer at the right time to drive their business results.","108":"If I look at whether it's IoT or AI, the two workloads that are new, both of them require both computation and intelligence on the edge and a very new way to do even computation, which event-driven computation.","109":"And it\u2019s new penetration, so it\u2019s not even a one-for-one replacement, even for the enterprise customer there consumption is going up.","110":"I think it's important to note that GDPR is affecting the entire online advertising industry.","111":"In terms of conversion rates, I\u2019d probably just go back to the discussion that we had on pricing and the fact that we\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of supply opportunity, and pricing is clearly lower on Stories than on Feed.","112":"And part of the results you see from us in different verticals are actually explained by the ability of us to help those marketers measure sales at the end of the day.","113":"because when people spend time viewing more posts because they're interacting with family and friends and they're not involved in longer post.","114":"We do like the fact that it creates a market for an iPhone at a different price point as well that is a better product than that customer maybe currently buying which would further help from an ecosystem point of view and that's not to be underestimated.","115":"There was an internet shutdown in Ethiopia that contributed a little bit to that.","116":"Tim has talked about Apple Pay.","117":"So I mentioned this stat earlier that we have about 33,000 bots that are live in Messenger, including experiences across a range of verticals, from news to e-commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things, and we're seeing some early progress.","118":"because of the FX situation, right.","119":"You know, we have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that they want to get to and look at in search.","120":"And if you look at this last quarter, our annuity grew double digits and our cloud grew triple digits.","121":"In general what we have to do is we use computers and AI for what they're good for which is looking at a lot of content very quickly and making quick judgments.","122":"IoT, for example, was not a workload on the old server world, whereas it's one of the big workloads for us.","123":"For the News Feed question, the North Star for us in News Feed is that we want to produce the best experience for everyone who is using the app and loading News Feed to see what is going on in the world around them, right?","124":"We have the ability to now tier even the database with the cloud.","125":"But hopefully that is a temporary condition.","126":"For example, one of the things that we see the most traction for HoloLens is with first-line workers.","127":"The revenue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double-digits.","128":"And from an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back perhaps but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really began this year,","129":"Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on that number was $49.","130":"Are we investing in the right types of people, in the right capabilities?","131":"So we are building some capacity ahead of our immediate needs.","132":"And the more we \u2013 the better we get at measuring those returns, the better the ads get.","133":"There is IoT.","134":"So that I think will also transcend or lead into even media companies.","135":"And Sheryl alluded to it in her earlier commentary about if we get better at converting our impressions into things that are valuable for advertisers and we get more efficient in doing that, we'll be rewarded with better pricing and higher demand at better pricing as a result of that hard work.","136":"There's many different use cases.","137":"But as you can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 billion impact in Q2 2020.","138":"There\u2019s a much larger breadth of possibilities here for customers than in our other products.","139":"And so if you do that, our guidance is actually 8% to 11% because we have about a 700 basis point FX headwind in Q1.","140":"And this is something that they've always focused on.","141":"We've rolled out in all countries where we offer Facebook ads.","142":"And I love magazines.","143":"It's going to open up a much greater diversity of use cases, not only making it so that use cases like facemasks or style transfers that we already have, you're now going to have thousands of options instead of just 10 or 20 at a time.","144":"And this tough compare eventually isn't the benchmark.","145":"And CRM has taken our own Dynamics product, has taken some pretty unique approaches.","146":"And we've got a goal of bringing more than 10 million online by 2025.","147":"We use those primarily for movement between our warehouses and our source centers.","148":"because of some of the core capabilities of Windows 10 when it comes to security, manageability.","149":"I know both of them will matter and both of them are important, and so that\u2019s why I tend to focus on that all up server KPI combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the edge which is the on-prem.","150":"We see a lot of organic connections between businesses and consumers, and our experience is that where are those \u2013 where we have those organic connections, that's very promising to turn that into monetization as well.","151":"There's some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses.","152":"I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third party units.","153":"One of them recently was LEGO.","154":"In particular, we now have a subscription offer with Game Pass that's off to a good very good start and our goal is to be able to have essentially a Netflix for games, so that we can have the game subscriptions that people can use across all of the devices that they play in.","155":"And that's because we've built up engineering locations in key areas like Seattle, London, New York, Boston, Tel Aviv.","156":"And so obviously at some point if those technologies move to lower price points and that there's probably more unit demand.","157":"So we're seeing good diversified growth.","158":"We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as they move into the program.","159":"So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth, but the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both of those numbers.","160":"We do realize it's a capital-intensive business and we have modeling that shows it's going to be a very \u2013 it is a very good business for us and that's what we aim for as long-term return on invested capital and free cash flow.","161":"A lot of the work that we end up doing goes towards making it easier for small businesses to be able to -- without a big technology shop, be able to use the same tools, get access to payments, set up storefronts easily, being able to measure the effectiveness of ads.","162":"Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audiences.","163":"The -- I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway we grew finance leases, which is essentially our props for capital leases for infrastructure by 9% in Q1 and it was 10% all of last year coming off a year in 2017 where we had growth of 69%.","164":"I see AR as being profound.","165":"Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter, from Japan to Brazil to India, some even stronger numbers than that in Russia.","166":"Now, this all goes to the balance sheet.","167":"So a recent example, HTC working with their agency Swift did Instagram videos to raise awareness of their mobile device warranty program.","168":"And so, by the time you move all of that out of the comparison group, you really get back to very similar trends in our D&C licensing business that we saw this quarter for what I think was a component to you are focused on which is OEM Pro and OEM non-Pro, which we expect to really resemble the results we saw this quarter and marry -- and to matched up PC business dynamics overall.","169":"The next component which is a change is we have actually launched some of our Office 365 consumer services in Japan, which is a Geo that we had not been in historically.","170":"We saw a little bit more impact of E5 this quarter in ARPU than we have been seeing.","171":"This is very small still.","172":"So, again, signed a number of big customers.","173":"I don't have the percentage of exactly how many customers are working on this type of measurement with us.","174":"All of that is transforming Maersk.","175":"In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services.","176":"Let's just take for example what's happening in a factory.","177":"I do think the work we showed at the analyst meeting on the importance of increasing the install base across Office and Exchange, that it did occur again this quarter.","178":"Feed is fundamentally about information being pushed to a consumer and us helping figure out what is most interesting and most engaging and I think, in many ways, positive for people.","179":"And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa.","180":"One of the examples I showed at F8 was around using object recognition and computer vision to be able to point your camera at something and then tap on it and get a card of information and maybe even a buy button.","181":"The three largest countries were India, the U.S. and Brazil.","182":"so in the near-term we're investing to grow the community, execute on the existing business, both on the product side and then the advertising and sales force side.","183":"It's a lot lower.","184":"There's also discounts for other groups.","185":"So video is having an impact, but we grew expenses 39% year-over-year in the first quarter.","186":"If we had not gotten started on some of the distributed computing infrastructure in a completely different place, we wouldn't have even had Azure.","187":"We're very focused on the privacy of what people do, wherever they do it, and using the information we have in a very responsible way.","188":"We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins.","189":"And we think that that's going to be positive, right.","190":"We had over 350 significant new features and services and we believe that's what resonates with customers.","191":"Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable.","192":"And for example, they would target in the U.S. age 18 and above frequent international travelers living in cities where they had routes or Indian expats living in the U.S. to promote new routes to Mumbai.","193":"And now the professional cloud or the professional network helps usage across all of that professional usage.","194":"We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion on mobile platform in China.","195":"And in order to promote things both in and what we\u2019re doing on Instagram with shopping and in Facebook Marketplace and in the general approach to payments is providing as affordably as possible to improve the user experience and complete transactions which will of course make the tools more valuable for businesses overall and should make the ad prices go up.","196":"One is this true distributed hybrid.","197":"And we're continuing to invest across the board in terms of our core R&D and innovation efforts in terms of headcount growth there.","198":"And that's a fine way and we'll keep account of it, but that's not how it works.","199":"If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the iPhone Xs in the U.S. the same as we priced the iPhone X a year ago.","200":"But the key is even the consumption services come in different forms, there is the IR services, there is the data services, and some of the higher level services.","201":"We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years.","202":"We launched hashtag following in December.","203":"because these two factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat.","204":"We see a lot of growth in our data, both in terms of infrastructure but in the new services like our Data Lake services which are PaaS services.","205":"So for example, automatic placements, what automatic placements do is they convert Feed ads into a Stories format and deliver the ads wherever they get their best results.","206":"We sometimes talk about it as some stopping creative, where you actually want to stop and watch.","207":"So I think this is one where my optimism, frankly, for the structure of the market in the segment you chose, and my optimism for our positioning within that market is reflected in that investment number that you have seen.","208":"And going forward, we have a fantastic lineup of servers, not just the infrastructure, but even SharePoint, Exchange, Lync Server continues to have significant on-premise deployment.","209":"And so in terms of the Siri access point, as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions.","210":"And I think that's really what's allowing us to improve yield and effectively driving higher effective CPMs for us while still delivering business outcomes to them at attractive ROIs.","211":"I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest \u2013 if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the services revenue, so it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously, and 30,000 or so subscription apps.","212":"With the auto industry, really important industry for growth for us, helping them figure out who their current customers are, who their potential customers are and where are the audience segments out there who have similar likes, interests, backgrounds, demographics to their current customers so that they can serve right ad to the right people.","213":"It continues to make an increasing contribution to the business.","214":"And that backend in many cases in regulator industries with the GEO participation we have is needed everywhere.","215":"We have Amazon Devices.","216":"And so it can make a bit of a distraction towards seen the underlying trends.","217":"We continue to see growth in users.","218":"Those are things that we just think are just going to be ubiquitous.","219":"In terms of the strength that we're seeing in the U.S. and Canada on the revenue front, obviously, Instagram is playing a big, big role there and the growth of impressions from Stories is factoring into it.","220":"And that matters to multinational companies but also are trying to operate across many geographies and jurisdictions.","221":"So they want local compute.","222":"And in fact, this last quarter, some of the most strategic announcements were all around our application platform.","223":"because it can make their ad serving and buying more efficient across the platforms they use.","224":"You can click through or tap through to a message thread, and then you can either get customer support or complete a transaction or do a follow-on transaction.","225":"And I think what you're seeing is that as we enable more use cases and as we just get a lot of the basics right around performance and bringing the mobile features into parity and beyond what we've been able to do on desktop, the volume is growing quickly.","226":"This has been a dream of mine for, I don't know, for 15 years probably.","227":"There's a lot of demand that comes in the last six weeks of the year as well.","228":"It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers.","229":"After all we did run large-scale consumer services ourselves between Xbox LIVE and Bing.","230":"It is the place you will look and see that number and outside of that I mean those really are the biggest contributors.","231":"And so there would have been some switchers on top of that from other operating systems, but obviously android is the largest one by far.","232":"So we have great relationships with third party carriers.","233":"5.1% operating margin was up from 3.9% in Q1 and 3% last Q2.","234":"In addition, I mentioned video content as being a driver.","235":"The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business.","236":"In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and app content, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for online stores revenue.","237":"Obviously, when we come down to capital allocation decisions, we obviously also keep in mind that the opportunity for us to do some M&A activities which we do in an ongoing basis.","238":"So within that context, we're not breaking out specific cohorts, but we remain a great place for advertisers to reach Millennials.","239":"In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers.","240":"They've done a great job of implementing a lot of iOS features in their apps and we're looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.","241":"And that\u2019s something that we have the capability of doing, and we want to be able to do that in a disciplined way.","242":"And we've seen experiences both in terms of a lighthearted like Candace Payne and also more serious, more serious issues around the U.S. and around the globe.","243":"At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was.","244":"Right now, a lot of what people are sharing are their social videos and content.","245":"And if your goal is to connect to everyone and make sure that people can all participate, that ads-based model makes a lot of sense and we're going to continue to invest very heavily there.","246":"PC gaming is a growth market.","247":"We see in fact increased engagement with titles like Minecraft.","248":"For the first time in fact, in our own Microsoft history, we have an extensibility model that is the same for Office 365 and Dynamics 365.","249":"But you don\u2019t need to build out data centers much before they\u2019re really being utilized.","250":"We even see, obviously, the end-user parts of the infrastructure when it comes to enterprise mobility.","251":"They come back in and they pay less for the service but they pay more for their smartphone.","252":"It has to go all the way through for this to work from discovery, all the way through a pretty seamless checkout flow.","253":"Gene, if you look at the overall worldwide, we grew iPhone 40%.","254":"Because increasingly, there will be more devices and we want to make sure that we're adding value and if we add value in that context, you will be more inclined to retain or purchase the Office subscription.","255":"You need hybrid and guess what, today in 2019, hybrid has become much more main stream.","256":"It could be as someone coming from Office 365.","257":"Because it's super-important for us in this phase when people are looking for solutions to help them visually transform, for us to have a very fundamentally different type of capability in terms of our sales, and that's the transformation.","258":"And if we can drive those affectively that will translate into higher effective prices for our business.","259":"because that's part of our seasonal pattern, which gets offset by a favorable commodity environment that we've seen for a number of quarters now.","260":"There are also good partnerships in place now across the industry, across law enforcement, the intelligence communities, not just in the U.S. but across other countries, too.","261":"But we're getting good feedback on that upfront.","262":"I mean, we grew 87% in China.","263":"In terms of the other things that we're doing, we have some great capability and great teams in Apple.","264":"We had automatic default templates which convert your feed ads into vertical Stories format and this quarter we just launched customizable templates, which help you save time and resources.","265":"Just to size it for you, the impact of memory on our gross margin is 40 bps sequentially and 110 bps on a year over year basis.","266":"For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone.","267":"And I think as of a few minutes ago, the first sales started in Australia.","268":"And so on occasion what that does, even with the negative currency impact on C&B, is have a bit of lumpiness over time.","269":"We've garnered awards, of course, but mainly that what we're focused on is good content that is attractive to customers.","270":"They saw a three times increase in their online bookings and I think those kind of results are made possible by more vertical-specific products,","271":"because a lot of people will move an existing workload into the cloud.","272":"I would say globally especially outside the US, we saw good improvements around -- engagement around video.","273":"So the full pickup on that year-over-year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that.","274":"This is a decision we made many, many years ago in some sense inception of Azure was built for a future which is much more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client server area.","275":"As you pointed out, there is a couple components that make gross profit dollars per seat or the life time value of a customer depending on the terms you want to use improve and increase over the life cycle.","276":"And when you look at the consumer time we get, we are not getting the equivalent amount of time or resources from our marketers really of any size, and therein lies our opportunity to grow.","277":"Same thing with data, the DocumentDB is a massive thing for us.","278":"The second way is AirPlay 2, which we have as just pointed out we have support on a number of different third-party TVs.","279":"It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter.","280":"And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year.","281":"But most importantly, architectural benefit for customers because by having incoherence around these layers is where you may feel like you're making some great best-of-breed sort of choices in individual layers, but you'll bear that expense in your overall agility as well as your overall management of your data","282":"Even last quarter, political spending even within the U.S. alone was not a top-10 vertical for us.","283":"And while we have opportunities to grow impressions on Facebook and Instagram, that's less so in feed, where we already have healthy ad loads in - on both surfaces and more in Stories where we have lower CPMs.","284":"And I will just add that we're also making pretty significant changes in just the very workflow of our engineering teams and that also leads to us getting more out of our current investments.","285":"And this happened very quickly, right?","286":"So, for example, we have this Pages Manager App.","287":"It's coming in talent.","288":"We've learned that we can't just rely on teaching our clients and teaching the ad agencies to do it, but helping them do that.","289":"It's about the investment we've made in capability, the evolution of the product and its innovation.","290":"I mean this whole trend is much newer than the trend with News Feed and feeds overall and it continues to grow incredibly quickly.","291":"This quarter was particularly strong for brand, are really recognizing that they can do big brand buys on our platform like they would do on TV, but make them much more targeted.","292":"So that workflow, we have every layer of it.","293":"And we also benefited from the extra day in the quarter due to the leap year, but strong performance from many of the categories","294":"They're easy to build.","295":"It then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through servers that we used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our own Amazon businesses.","296":"That's the same case with GE.","297":"Right, I would say actually we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency, 7% before LinkedIn.","298":"Instagram is clearly making a contribution and as is the Audience Network.","299":"They're selling girls' clothing.","300":"And there are going to need to be big advances there, but that's really exciting.","301":"So if you were to exclude that foreign exchange impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in margins.","302":"I mean one of the things that I always think about it, for all the success we\u2019ve had in our server business, we were a low share player.","303":"In my opening commentary, I talked a little bit about both the increased visits to the Store and transactions as well as the fact that we are attracting new applications from developers like Netflix to Wall Street Journal to others.","304":"And in fact, it's not about in fact taking any old workload per se, but it's about reimagining what they want to do across these.","305":"But generally, just strong usage growth -- usage growth continues to be strong growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate, and customers continued to add workloads and expand.","306":"They worked with agencies Horizon, David & Goliath and Adaptly, and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create two different custom audience groups.","307":"And quite frankly, I was the one who opened up our communications and collaborations for other CRM vendors.","308":"When you see the Dynamics 365 growth or Azure IoT growth, taking every IoT project, it ends up as a field service project, so that's a classic way somebody says, let me sense something, predict something and then actually fix using field service.","309":"Is this something that the world needs Microsoft to be doing, or is it well served by others?","310":"And as you know, we work with our hedging program where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term.","311":"In fact we amortize our CapEx across all of these and we pay attention to margin and premium mix.","312":"Customers are relying on us for not only that footprint, but as they continue to expand to sit under the Tier 1 opportunity we haven't seen before.","313":"There are a number of other things that we're doing too, including creating an external program for independent academics to study how the impact of social media and how foreign governments try to interfere in elections.","314":"Of course, we have done smaller acquisitions, but they add up.","315":"It can start with some of our devices in the first-line worker.","316":"I think where you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now, and so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that.","317":"It\u2019s one common infrastructure and one common data center footprint between O365 Azure, CRM, Xbox Live everything.","318":"You can buy the different ad formats within Facebook and Instagram.","319":"So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown \u2013 we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis.","320":"We have content from Japan to Korea to many countries, and we have great content from China as well, and so there are many hands in the products.","321":"The global growth rate was 53% and North America growth rate was 50%.","322":"It's not just the Silicon Valley startups anymore, it is the core enterprise that is also becoming a digital company and we are well positioned to serve them and that's good to see.","323":"We are using payments in some of our other products in ways that enable some of the interactions we want to see.","324":"And the targeting that is custom audiences underlies all of our product offerings.","325":"because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content, you come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience.","326":"It's becoming essential.","327":"And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically on the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent.","328":"If you look at the 8 and 8 Plus, when we launched them, they instantly became our top two selling products.","329":"So now what we're trying to do is just increase the SLAs that we have across all of these different types of content and security threats that we might see.","330":"I see it every day in my Outlook Mobile.","331":"I think people just would watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that.","332":"And like the rest of the world, or most of the rest of the world, IDC is projecting that PC sales in China contracted by 5% last quarter.","333":"This can be a long-term virtuous cycle and sustainable business model in way that we can help support journalism.","334":"And so what we have right now, which is a situation, it\u2019s not surprising to us, we knew we would be here, is that the watch gross margins for the current quarter that we\u2019ve included in the guidance that Luca\u2019s provided in the aggregate, are lower than the company average.","335":"Their business owner, Joanna [Cariello], took photos of her products on her phone and then created ads with our Shop Now button.","336":"There's also \u2013 in that line item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video and digital music.","337":"Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking forward to.","338":"So when we talk about enterprise management suite growth, a lot of it is just obviously is management growth, but it's also security and data protection growth.","339":"If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter.","340":"We continue to add selection.","341":"We are also seeing a great efficiency in the business on a cost basis.","342":"Operating income last year was $1 billion.","343":"And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we - Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees.","344":"So for example, while there is no formal groups product on Instagram, people use Explore.","345":"Same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia but also many places in Western Europe as well.","346":"I mean, the hearings didn't just touch on that.","347":"And Instagram creates a pure experience that's focused on photos and videos.","348":"And they're inherently less efficient than more established mature buildings, so there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.","349":"We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will.","350":"We are nowhere near serving that as well as we want to.","351":"So that's why we have a very long-term view on Quantum, and the things that we did even in this last quarter is take things like the quantum simulator stuff and bring it to Azure.","352":"Our customers are telling us that.","353":"With Rift, it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s early in the evolution of VR; it\u2019s early to be talking about large volumes.","354":"Line item is growing at about the same rate.","355":"And it's the fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million.","356":"But this year or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G and we couldn't be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhone to produce that great experience for people.","357":"And obviously, Instagram is continuing to grow nicely as well, so that's another contributing factor there.","358":"I would like to point out that the ever year major product hit a high on the active install base.","359":"So the Office commercial business grew 5%.","360":"And so many of those were sold into emerging markets, not all of them, but many of them.","361":"We\u2019ve done a bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly, broadly targeted on Facebook.","362":"We've built our business around price selection and convenience.","363":"The iPhone 6s is the most popular iPhone that we currently sell.","364":"That\u2019s what you see when we see our subscription growth in consumer, we see subscription growth in small business these are folks who never bought a server from us.","365":"because the best of the people creating those shows and starring in those shows are also engaging with Facebook, and I think the vision Mark laid out for this all along is that, we should do video in a pretty social way.","366":"Faster outside, data that we gave at the end of the year.","367":"And they saw 9.3 times return of investment over the two week holiday period.","368":"because we're delivering growth against a much larger scale News Feed business in the prior-year period and also, of course, headwinds are an impact as well, as you mentioned.","369":"Whereas on Facebook Messenger, the graph is your friends, and you're more likely to, say, wish an acquaintance happy birthday on Facebook Messenger than on WhatsApp or you might not have their phone number in the first place.","370":"And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago.","371":"And so we don't enter into those with no experience, although we will enter into them humbly.","372":"That I think is going to create great value for enterprises, and that's showing up in all the pilots.","373":"We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result.","374":"I'd say commerce broadly and e-commerce is an important vertical for our advertising business.","375":"You've got the impact of the opt-outs","376":"That's going to integrate more than 30,000 facilities and 1,500 suppliers and partners in Volkswagen's global supply chain over time.","377":"Under the old methodology we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter.","378":"We've seen great response from customers.","379":"We think we can do that in a privacy-protected way, and it's just a better experience.","380":"We build and then build businesses around these apps.","381":"Prime Now, I guess, my comments are that, it's in 50 cities worldwide, it's across 9 countries.","382":"Lastly, even when it's comes to devices, we want to take an approach that brings all assistants.","383":"We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning.","384":"I think it's a huge opportunity.","385":"We have Linux is first class","386":"And I would say if anything, the initial data from our customers around security is gaining a lot of traction.","387":"There were not any one-time benefits in this quarter that helped us.","388":"It is a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365 and it includes EMS.","389":"So that\u2019s what hopefully gives you a flavor for the IP that we have.","390":"It's key to our 2017 goals and executing on our three, five, and 10-year roadmap, the one that Mark outlined.","391":"Most of that is for the AWS business.","392":"A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to succeed and grow their online businesses, you'll see from our press release that we've launched a new apps for that.","393":"And on that front, we\u2019re -- substantial majority of our expenses are U.S. dollar base.","394":"We think there's a lot of opportunity for people to have commercial intent, if not have it when they start, but develop it because they see things they're interested in, in both.","395":"You also have to keep in mind that we're making large investments in India.","396":"Oh, I think there's no doubt if you look at it we are expanding the market size in those areas.","397":"Yeah, so as we mentioned, the ASP for iPhone was up $99, 18% increase year-over-year and this is really driven by the mix, by the fact that we've added iPhone 6 Plus to a new price point and in general, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio.","398":"We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits.","399":"We have the premium part of our line is the 6s and the 6s Plus.","400":"And I think as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we've seen there so far.","401":"I mean, GEICO example is a good one.","402":"But some of \u2013 the vast majority of the content that's consumed on Facebook just talking about video right now is people browsing through feed.","403":"And the cost is also high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs.","404":"we recognize the majority of our third-party advertising revenues of the Audience Network on a net rather than gross basis.","405":"One is the case of the mix shift to Azure as it grows at the pace we're seeing it does impact quarter to quarter.","406":"And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%.","407":"In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves.","408":"We've had a really nice program in extra internships where we're taking people who are not yet majoring in computer science but we think have the ability, and teaching them for a summer and seeing them return, to the work we're doing with our female engineers to make sure that all forms of bias are surfaced and eliminated.","409":"And so, that has a factor on desktop growth.","410":"We think that, working together with them we can expand on that in the future.","411":"I would say during the course of the quarter the biggest impact came from the Japanese yen, the Russian rubel, but also from euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar.","412":"And when we get to Q4 we\u2019re going to be lapping some particularly successful optimizations that we had in Q4 and that\u2019s going to contribute to more of a decel in Q4 than we think we\u2019ll see in Q3.","413":"And continually again AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem, and also the stronger security that we offer.","414":"It adds - if it's in the FBA program, it adds Prime eligible selection.","415":"As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we set a record from switchers from other platforms, the largest we've ever seen in any six-month period before, so we've got traction there.","416":"We\u2019re obviously -- we're just in the U.S. right now and so there's tons of countries to go to and there is not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t get notes from many businesses outside U.S. running Apple Pay and banks and merchants.","417":"It's been double-digit consistent growth.","418":"Stories it is the biggest individual driver of impression growth, and we talked about how that is coming through at lower prices.","419":"One of the new suites we have is called F1 and this is about first-line work.","420":"We opened up a Amazon four-star location in New York City where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon.","421":"We're able to do more business objectives, all of which can use the same targeting as we have on Facebook and all of which are increasingly tapping into our measurement capabilities.","422":"In terms of what's going on with iPhone, the 35% growth is almost three times the market.","423":"It's the reason for Apple TV and what we're doing in the living room.","424":"Another example is just spam filtering and just making sure that we can actually read the content and understand what's interesting to you or not and not show that.","425":"I don\u2019t want to miss this one other big scenario which is Cortana , that\u2019s perhaps the thing that\u2019s going to change personal productivity even most and especially with Windows 10 and how Cortana comes to Windows, both to the browser as well as to the start, I think it completely change what personal productivity software mean from a day-to-day experience as well.","426":"If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year, at the end of the year.","427":"So, that means there\u2019s a bunch of workloads that are migrating to the cloud, people use both Azure Stack plus Azure.","428":"When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing.","429":"The gross margins are impacted by first party versus third party mix, as well as AWS mix if you're looking at the total for the company.","430":"The overall commercial cloud revenue mix, but I would also say the directionality of the Azure gross margin for example which recent significantly improved we expect to continue.","431":"We think our website is very tuned to selling online.","432":"If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top three selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was number one and has been for a couple of quarters, and iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the U.S., UK and Japan.","433":"And it obviously also fuels the services business.","434":"That's another theme that we have.","435":"And then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter which are not going to repeat this year.","436":"So we've said often that we think that virtual reality and augmented reality could be the next big computing platform.","437":"I think in the last quarter, you saw in health care, in retail, in financial services.","438":"And if you think about the connection to why that happens it's not just a terrific engineering work that we've done in product value, it's also the investments that we've made to put resources and some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud and we've added resources that we're seeing the revenue get recaptured in that way.","439":"We see customers have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS Database Migration Service.","440":"And so we are now in a position where we have $285 billion of cash, we've got $122 billion of debt for a net cash of $163 billion.","441":"But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year.","442":"not that no one event drives our business, we're pretty large and diversified.","443":"82% of people who start advertising with us start with our really simple ad products.","444":"Total bookings, because the volatility frankly in consumer businesses in times like the holiday periods, it can make it far more volatile than usually what many of you have been asking for, which is the continuity and health of the overall commercial business.","445":"It can be someone coming from Azure, Dynamics, EMS.","446":"Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods, it was purchased in August of last year and that has impacted every quarter since then, Q4 will be the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them since Q2 of last year.","447":"India, we set a new first-half record.","448":"But along with the bookstores, we also have \u2013 you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points.","449":"We have a partnership with them on e-signatures.","450":"because our market share is extremely high.","451":"We right now are working on getting the capacity in.","452":"And we had things like same-day delivery which we talked about.","453":"Then, and this is where it gets even more interesting, they retargeted people who watched the video with over 500 personalized video ads which were optimized for Facebook and Instagram.","454":"If you think about gross margins in particular, what you'll see is Azure continuing to be a growing percentage of the total revenue growth.","455":"So nothing specific to call out on that.","456":"That tends to have a very good margin profile.","457":"As you know the -- gaming is the top category on the App Store.","458":"We're really working on shifting people to understanding what their real objectives are so that they can focus on driving businesses.","459":"The first and the largest issue is the end of the Nokia commercial agreement that\u2019s about $650 million that we earned in Q2 of a year ago that because of the ended the agreement simply goes away.","460":"because we've constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off the charts you can wind up doing fairly well over time.","461":"It makes the experience in the living room with people using our products even better.","462":"So I am not waiting for some future date to see ROI from AI, we're very much going forward even the office tools example I used.","463":"When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014 about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program.","464":"We made acquisitions when they made sense.","465":"And so if you look at then our ability to grow in the Azure would be larger or over any period of time then ARPU seat or per user businesses it certainly could be but I don\u2019t want that to really diminish the fact that there is a lot of room for us and our per seat businesses particularly across LinkedIn, the Power platform work we're doing.","466":"If you look in China, it's over 70%.","467":"Outlook is the email client for Windows.","468":"And so you build the computer system, in that way they can flag and get rid of some of the worst stuff, and so they can flag for human review, some of the stuff that's borderline and then there's just so much content flowing through the system that we do need a lot of people looking at this.","469":"We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year.","470":"One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads.","471":"I had a recent trip, where I was in Berlin and Dublin, talking to a bunch of folks, who are policymakers or academics out there.","472":"Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line.","473":"because it has a lot of potential.","474":"We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain.","475":"But a lot of what we can get at are recommendations on products and travel and restaurants and things that your friends have shared, they haven't shared publicly, and knowing different correlations, or interesting things about what your friends are interested in, and that's the type of stuff, those are questions that we can answer that no one else can answer, and that's probably going to be what we continue to focus on doing first.","476":"We've made significant changes in how we've allocated our own organic dollars, both in R&D as well as in sales and marketing.","477":"So while other revenue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that.","478":"because right now most assistants are fairly dumb in terms of just doing one-turn dialogue, but where we're going to go is multi-turn dialogue and that requires real natural language understanding.","479":"The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods.","480":"They then used Nielsen Brand Effects and were able to measure a 16-point lift in ad recall and a 5-point lift in intent to visit Subway.","481":"And we have really wanted to support the publishers.","482":"But we've also been innovating over the past several years.","483":"We launched, for example, Teams for first-line workers, which had things like shift worker capabilities, secure messaging.","484":"So that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you see in margin year-over-year.","485":"As people spend more time with News Feed, we get better about understanding what they like and getting the content that they care about in front of them.","486":"So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories.","487":"So, as Phil mentioned, we are seeing continued increases in usage, both sequentially and year-over-year.","488":"And more interestingly the mix of all of them because the enterprise is heterogeneous.","489":"What we are talking about is the fulfillment center \u2013 additional fulfillment center costs that we see this time every year as we get ready for Q4 but also additional step-up in content spend, where we spend a lot of our content in Q3.","490":"They were the first part of the community to get access to these new features.","491":"What happens on our platform is often that people will start out during demand generation and then use the repeat opportunity to show people ads, moving down the funnel to demand fulfillment.","492":"because for too long our industry has been focused on proxy metrics, how long someone viewed a video, even brand lift, measurements we care about, but these are all proxy metrics.","493":"It's an enormous sized market and whether it grows, from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge.","494":"It's very early in our rollout, but nothing inconsistent with what we've been modeling.","495":"Are we executing well on it?","496":"because really, this is the quarter when you've been able to see actually in Q2 and Q3 now us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our Intelligent Cloud and the opportunity we see there across engineering, sales and marketing.","497":"It includes things like the Community Operations investments that we talked about today in the announcement.","498":"And also we just, we created a new category of 2-in-1s where even our OEMs are finding success, which was one of our strategic objectives of doing the Surface.","499":"The majority of potential signal loss on targeting is still in front of us.","500":"So at a high-level you can either sort of add more, expand your footprint or you get to add a new customer and both of those are motions that we focus on and I feel good about our execution.","501":"But I just think that the area that it's currently operating within, it's hard to tell the difference of the consumer level for us.","502":"About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3.","503":"And you're absolutely seeing the impact of that growth as mix show up in the gross margin.","504":"So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year.","505":"And of course, Apple is the only company that could have brought this because it requires both hardware and software integration, and it requires sort of making a lot of \u2013 or giving the operating system update to many people at once.","506":"So I'm not going to say a stat, but it's grown a lot","507":"And they used Audience Insights, targeting people ages 18 to 49 who purchase meat and cheese, and that's just pretty incredible targeting.","508":"On the first one, on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services.","509":"And then lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers.","510":"And so we're working toward those things.","511":"I think we felt very good, those as well, I think we\u2019re pretty broad-based across industry.","512":"So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.","513":"I view that as strategic relevance long term inside of digital accounts.","514":"I think one of the things that's interesting about Instagram is while the ads are really visually appealing and that brings to mind certain verticals like fashion or autos, things where the visual really matters, what we're seeing is that lots of different verticals can use the platform really well.","515":"The only thing I'll add is when I look at the total growth of Azure, the growth that's coming now from some of the premium services, these are businesses that we actually did not ever participate on premise at all.","516":"So to me, those high-level services will over time attach in Azure, but also in Dynamics as well as in Office 365.","517":"So we're pretty early in this whole thing and there's so much unique content that people share in Facebook that I think that that is the clear, unique opportunity to go for first, right?","518":"And that's -- everything is already very tightly integrated kind of below the surface, in a way that people using these apps may not feel.","519":"So we made a number of changes and are still making changes to prioritize meaningful interactions between people over passive consumption of content.","520":"Yeah, I'm going to be vague on the scale of it, but their capital intensity is offset by their density and throughput.","521":"On fashion, yeah, fashion and apparel continue to be a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excited about.","522":"And so I think our year-over-year improvement as well as sequential improvement and our ability in the overall commercial business, you see the gross margins we did has the mix shift to the cloud, I think we\u2019re all quite proud of.","523":"And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans.","524":"And we expect that to be -- it started to be a little more balanced cost globally as we move into 2020.","525":"So, Peter, just on the \u2013 on ads engagement, that's an area that we've obviously been very focused on, and we're really pleased with the results that we're seeing there in terms of driving better engagement per ad, and that's really the focus of a lot of our quality and relevance efforts.","526":"I think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand awareness, discovery and eventually purchase.","527":"We will do that overtime,","528":"And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving.","529":"So I think what we're going to end up seeing is building out Payments, which is going to end up being something that we do country-by-country \u2013 we have a test that is running in India for WhatsApp now, we're hoping to launch in several other countries at some point, but I don't want to put a timeframe on that here, but it's something that we're actively working on.","530":"So again, we're very excited, number of different things we're working on, but certainly one of the drivers along with all of the things that I mentioned is certainly FBA is very helpful.","531":"We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience and we think they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon.","532":"I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively under in check the last two years in the infrastructure area.","533":"Now, in terms of having support for these different runtimes, you're absolutely right, that's the reason why for example on Azure itself Java is first class.","534":"Overall, in terms of the workload mix, it\u2019s been fairly stable, which is our hybrid value proposition really has continued to resonate.","535":"And so we'll expect to see more of that flow through over time.","536":"So I think that is kind of playing out as we expected.","537":"You\u2019re seeing leverage through the P&L and we\u2019ll see a moderating rate in FY\u201919 even if Q1 is the big quarter.","538":"But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I'll say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers,","539":"We're going to have great flagship phones for Windows 10.","540":"We're very happy with all the customers we have but particularly the Prime customers that we have.","541":"And the idea there is that people want to interact in lots of different ways.","542":"A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business.","543":"On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials.","544":"Thanks for the question.","545":"And so we do put a lot of weight behind that.","546":"I will point out that we have continued to lower prices.","547":"And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether, frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS.","548":"Video content is with the new global program, global Prime Video is becoming more global with the launch in India as well.","549":"So in Q1 of this year, subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.","550":"And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth.","551":"And we also see small businesses.","552":"So we're investing a lot in this","553":"But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers.","554":"As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter.","555":"So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year, so we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well.","556":"I think the smartphone market is sort of like the best market for a consumer product company in the history of the world and \u2013 but that's how I feel about it.","557":"So, you\u2019re certainly seeing that impacted.","558":"But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in.","559":"On the growth in MAUs in rest of world, we've had certain slowdowns.","560":"So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S.","561":"They hold us accountable for making their experience quick, and we want to do everything we can to do that.","562":"And we think that there's a lot more connecting in community that people want there.","563":"And so the nut of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off.","564":"So you're going to see this continually from us.","565":"When we look into 2019, we do expect to see a deceleration of revenue growth throughout the year.","566":"I do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really starts to click here, right?","567":"So all these things are making the program better and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible.","568":"And generally what we find is that price is important.","569":"We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way, if that's how they choose.","570":"We're pretty encouraged by what we've seen even though it's pretty early days.","571":"We continue to see that.","572":"So we think that's all foundational.","573":"Just a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center world right now and our transport networks.","574":"So yes, and we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to, versus licensing many times by country, the third-party rights to content that we don't create ourselves.","575":"But I don't think that there is really a strategy to pull this in from 10 years to five, I just think it's going to be a 10-year thing.","576":"But as I think about \u2013 I tend to focus as you know on the all-up server and product KPI","577":"So, Stories is obviously one of the big growing areas for us and continues to be a big driver.","578":"I mean we have -- we are pleased with the engagement that we're seeing on the Facebook app broadly.","579":"But we're looking \u2013 we think there is still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime.","580":"Digital technology today is not about tech companies doing innovation.","581":"So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefits it's delivering.","582":"I don't think we have any specific stats to share on this, but it's going well.","583":"As we look back on that, there were number of factors.","584":"E5 continues to see encouraging signs.","585":"So, there's a lot of different influences there.","586":"And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, so whether that's businesses, public figures like athletes and celebrities and types of folks that people want to interact with on these different platforms, and we did that on Facebook in News Feed group pages, and we're working on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger.","587":"It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it.","588":"So I think it strikes me as very likely that the next one is going to be around virtual and augmented reality.","589":"So I think geographically we are seeing very, very good performance.","590":"You're also right that we are very focused on commerce ads on Facebook, that the great, great, great majority of activity is commerce ads on Facebook.","591":"And so Pages are a good and free and easy way to have a mobile presence, and that's something we're very focused on growing.","592":"And so people now are spending more time on the Store, they download more apps, and that over time translates into monetization.","593":"But overall, I believe this hyperscale plus hybrid architecturally helps us a lot with enterprise customers","594":"As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone and that's a combination of single digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X.","595":"And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads.","596":"So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves.","597":"Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts.","598":"But I think over the very long term, which is how you framed your question, we have a lot of opportunity.","599":"We saw a strong double-digit growth in premium.","600":"And then in addition, we're continuing to focus our product development around putting privacy first and that's going to, we believe, have some impact on revenue growth.","601":"We've had really great productive discussions with the Indian government, and I fully expect that at some point, they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country.","602":"If we're delivering on those three elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third-party.","603":"So that's, if you wanted to break it down into two more sustaining things, those are the types of things we're seeing in that number.","604":"And we're pretty excited about what that shows in terms of how video can be used in a really broad-based way but also a more personal way.","605":"And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number,","606":"I mean, my own take of this, I think this has gone pretty well and has done what we had hoped, although we've made a number of changes.","607":"So that's really the main focus.","608":"We've done such a terrific job, I think, of growing and focusing and the innovation we put in and having our sales teams, through investments we've made for the past couple of years, and competency building, land that at customers.","609":"And finally, just the strong work on the infrastructure team, both between hardware innovation done at everything from the network, all the way to the prox and their integration with each other as well as the software innovation being done on top of it.","610":"Whether it's first-party games or third-party games, we are best-in-class in that monetization and that's what's reflected in the results.","611":"And so I think the use cases on this much like our phones will be broad based.","612":"Based on that experience, we're now planning to expand our channel before the holiday","613":"So, we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this.","614":"And what we're doing on Messenger and on WhatsApp are really making sure that businesses can connect with people, and then in the early stages of testing messaging.","615":"When I talk about the premium services mix, in our Office Commercial 365 business being about 60%, that is what's driving whether that's the mix shift to E3 or ultimately to E5 you will continue to see and have headroom in that number but you are right, we are encouraged by the ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose those premium SKUs over time.","616":"So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing is increasing, what I would call, annuity relationships and subscription relationships with all classes of customers.","617":"I feel very good about that.","618":"Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them all well.","619":"And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us.","620":"In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they are on upgrade plans and so forth.","621":"So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi-billion dollar business for us.","622":"So we're very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming.","623":"So it's multiple services.","624":"Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter.","625":"But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver and I feel that we did that.","626":"In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern.","627":"We continue to be pleased with the growth of Instagram both on a user basis and on a revenue basis.","628":"Yes, I think in terms of our core advertising products and growth, it's worth really remembering that our core feed products for Facebook and Instagram are growing nicely and well.","629":"So I'd expect we would continue to make changes and evolve.","630":"So, we feel very good about that and we feel that we have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone.","631":"And so I see the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand and for people that really want the best products.","632":"So we think of the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows, but also people will use phones of iOS and Android, but they need both productivity, creativity, and security across all of this estate of theirs, and that\u2019s where I think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition.","633":"And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out.","634":"So having mid-roll ads, we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user experience, but that is going to enable the kind of content that I think is going to take us to the next level.","635":"I think we're going to get to where we need to get to there.","636":"So on Search, we already have one very big use case which is people basically using our search engine to look out pages and people who are on Facebook and that by itself is already one of the biggest search engines in the world.","637":"I think that this is going to become increasingly important not just from the perspective of what does the privacy policy say but how is this deeply designed into the products that we're building.","638":"Overall these areas around commerce and payments, I think are one of the most exciting areas of product development for the next several years.","639":"So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth.","640":"And so we're bringing all of our energies to bear there.","641":"So we see a role for all carriers, in fact including the delivery service partner program that we\u2019ve developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well.","642":"Advertising is going to be the way that the revenue comes in for the foreseeable future, but what we expect is as we build out more commerce-related features around shopping, and Instagram and Marketplace and Facebook and certainly, the private social platform that we\u2019re \u2013 that I\u2019ve been talking about I think will lend itself to private interactions around payments and commerce and interacting with businesses in that way, I think what we\u2019re going this is we\u2019re going to build more tools for people to buy things directly through the platform.","643":"and we continue to build our products to serve a wide variety of audiences, including Millennials as well.","644":"So for the first time now, we have the ability to go to an enterprise and talk about their entire data estate across Windows and Linux.","645":"The value that we care about here is helping to build common ground.","646":"So yeah, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers for sure, authors, as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers.","647":"today we use some basic signals like who you're friends with and what pages you like as some of the most important things for figuring out what \u2013 out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show and what are going to be the most interesting things to you.","648":"This growth rate is going to bounce around.","649":"We did see ARPU growth this quarter.","650":"It all comes down to customer choice.","651":"So a lot of what we've been trying to do is make it so that we build out the infrastructure, so that way WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram direct can evolve rather than being just places where you message folks.","652":"I think what\u2019s exciting about those platforms is that they combine the art and the science of both a creative canvas that marketers are excited about and targeting.","653":"From a revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there.","654":"So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas.","655":"And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership save incremental dollars, because of it at Whole Foods.","656":"I would characterize the launch of Status apps on WhatsApp as being a much smaller thing than a driver of 2019 revenue growth, and it's going to be more about Instagram and Facebook.","657":"In terms of the timing, this is really early.","658":"Video ads are important on our platform and the most important thing that\u2019s growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing.","659":"I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those.","660":"And the other one is the on-premises server number which is very good in terms of hybrid demand this quarter also with high margin.","661":"In the United States, which is usually the most advanced market, 35% of small businesses have no web presence at all.","662":"And now, I think we're starting to work through what the formula is going to be so we can take some of those rate limits off and let video grow at the rate it wants to.","663":"So this is about getting projects started, making those projects successful, making sure customers feel the value and get the value of their investment.","664":"So we're comping that.","665":"So, it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it.","666":"It\u2019s not the only market that we are working on obviously.","667":"And so, as of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started.","668":"But it doesn't stop in Azure.","669":"And so between all of those hardware products, as well as our gaming performance, another sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches.","670":"So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us.","671":"And on the testimony, these are important issues and I think that that was an important moment to be able to go and hear what people were wondering about and just to have a public hearing of answering all of the questions around Cambridge Analytica and what we knew and all the steps that we're taking on data privacy and developers to make sure that this doesn't happen again and to lay out all the different things that we're doing.","672":"We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering.","673":"So I think what you're going to start to see are people interacting with pages, maybe follow a page on Facebook or Instagram.","674":"On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business.","675":"But generally what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic.","676":"We have stated that we want to double the size of the services business from the level that we had in fiscal 2016 by 2020.","677":"The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall.","678":"So one area where I'm very proud that we're doing great work is around identifying terrorist content.","679":"So there's no single factor, but those are all contributing factors in terms of MAU growth.","680":"But its\u2019 going well and I think we plan to roll it out every where pretty soon, so that\u2019s the game plan there.","681":"And so having control later in the process is very valuable to us especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network.","682":"And the biggest thing that I think we can take away from this as we invest in augmented reality in addition to virtual reality, is that the phone is probably going to be the mainstream consumer platform that a lot of these AR features first become mainstream rather than glasses form factor that people will wear on their face.","683":"So in our commercial business, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of continuing to outpace IT spend on an overall basis by continuing to push customers to our annuity business whether they are on -- on premise or the cloud.","684":"So that's one place where as you know, any AI project first starts with data, and that's one place where we are seeing good traction.","685":"Also, from the currency point of view and the weak global economies, we don\u2019t overly focus on this.","686":"So we are putting more compute behind that.","687":"Obviously, third party sellers are an important part of our value proposition there.","688":"It just we are now shipping more and more of our, other demand out of our warehouses, because of the strength in retail and FBA.","689":"So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there.","690":"And our ability to do that is why we're investing in the Audience Network.","691":"we feel slightly very good about where we are right now in the cycle.","692":"But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.","693":"And then we're continuing to invest heavily in our innovation investments.","694":"So between both of those and the first time buyers as well, it seems really, really good right now.","695":"So that is great.","696":"So I would say, yes, we had -- as we've mentioned the last couple of calls, we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity.","697":"And the best way we've done that is by simplified ad products.","698":"But overall, I mean the reason why we\u2019re interested in this as the social company is that we think that this is going to be a new way that people interact.","699":"So, attractive investments we believe, but ones that will take longer-term to pay off, and those would have a dilutive effect on margins in the near-term.","700":"I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related.","701":"And so I think, we'll keep investing in those areas.","702":"So the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone.","703":"I would say the overall change that we are going through, and this has been ongoing for I would say the last multiple years, is transforming our field engagement model, where we're putting a lot more technical depth in the front-line sellers so that they can engage, whether it's data specialists, cloud specialists, security specialists, or even productivity specialists.","704":"So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.","705":"And so I\u2019m really happy where we are currently, and happy enough that we\u2019re looking forward to expanding into more countries in late June.","706":"So it's a bit of an investment that has implications for a lot of elements to your cost structure, but we're very happy with Kiva.","707":"So I think it's the combination of all of that.","708":"As we always do when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within.","709":"But I think we're doing good work there now and it's growing quite quickly.","710":"But the more we can do it, even in studies with each client, the better our ads get.","711":"And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low, I mean in some cases, it's zero, that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world, that will buy smartphones and we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.","712":"And so there's no doubt about that.","713":"But we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season.","714":"So I would not characterize it as a cycle.","715":"There are things that remain relatively similar as we launch new products.","716":"We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions.","717":"We try to make it very easy for businesses to promote pages, promote posts and the like.","718":"For the smaller portion of our business it\u2019s still non-annuity per transactional, it does provide as I talked about earlier some opportunity but it\u2019s not that large just because the nature of the commitment our customers now is far more of the annuity type.","719":"And I think a lot of the success that we've seen has been because of some of the work that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News Feed and I mean that team has executed really well.","720":"So the pricing is really about what is the pricing that you're seeing in the overall system primarily driven on the Feed-based products.","721":"So on AI, I think that there's a very big shift in how we're going to think about content moderation on the platform.","722":"I do think the upgrade market will look at larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to -- how often and so forth.","723":"Whether it's frankly our views on gaming that Satya just discussed, I feel like the signal we're hearing is that we're in the right part of the market with customer-focused value that can deliver a high ROI to them, no matter what that IT budget looks like.","724":"However, that said, I think AR can be huge.","725":"So we're still very full in our fulfillment centers.","726":"At least that's what we're seeing in North America.","727":"And so we've worked hard to build measurement tools into the products, so that when you buy an ad, an SMB has a very easy interface and decide what their goals are.","728":"That once they understand what's really moving their product off shelves, online and off, that's where we get to the real work we need to do to optimize the ad and really work on the targeting.","729":"So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh and we've now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year.","730":"The team has actually done nice job in that segment, created some really modern offers, to get back and to enhance market that as well.","731":"We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops.","732":"But in our case there are two unique aspects.","733":"In the more temporal bucket this quarter as well as last you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature.","734":"And so we\u2019re really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country.","735":"So Reactions is going to rollout on every platform.","736":"So we're excited about what we're building there.","737":"And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising.","738":"So, that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base.","739":"And so, if we start to focus on one number or the other, I think we're missing the fact that our customer method and go-to-market is actually through the overall product portfolio.","740":"So our success in building - continuing to build good advertising products for our e-commerce clients on the advertising side will be a more important contributor to revenue in the foreseeable future than the new area.","741":"On the business side, I think we have both pleased with the results.","742":"That is a new experience that we're building, and building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it, and we'll see where that goes over time.","743":"That doesn't say that there is not a nice market for a home one.","744":"We usually will expand our content, expanding our device and usage.","745":"So that's obviously what we're looking for when we look forward.","746":"We feel very good about the long term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers.","747":"As I said earlier this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment and so hopefully that can turn into a positive for us.","748":"The last thing I'll say is that I think these things are more connected than people realize, in the sense that we're already seeing some nice traction with click-to-Messenger ads.","749":"And so overall, we do think that this tablet that can replace your laptop is ideally suited for productivity needs, which means it's great for your personal use as well as your use inside of the enterprise, and we continue to see good growth.","750":"But our focus is really on ensuring that we\u2019ve got capacity from available resources, whether it\u2019s our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure we\u2019re able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.","751":"And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces.","752":"First, we're continuing to add our AWS sales and marketing teams.","753":"No plans to bring that in-house.","754":"So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month, and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month, Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with.","755":"The opportunity I believe in both cases is high,","756":"The team did a great job of getting into supply demand balance there in December.","757":"So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business.","758":"Yeah, it was an incredible quarter.","759":"And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.","760":"In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true, that the upgrade cycle is longer.","761":"The one additional thing I\u2019d mention, which is increasingly becoming clearer to us is operational sovereignty will become important, the world and its distributed computing needs is not going to become some margin as set of requirements but it's going to be very heterogeneous, very in many cases regulated and so what we provide in terms of both the technology and the business model I think shows up with the maximum flexibility.","762":"So when you can both add to your install base and add overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business for our long-term goals.","763":"We're focusing more on shorter-form content to start.","764":"So I think the fact that we've already gotten 2 million advertisers to move into Stories is because we've gotten better at making it easier.","765":"The second factor is just anticipated changes that mobile platforms will make that will make targeting and measurement more difficult.","766":"So just on the question of how Oculus would affect the cost structure, it's premature for us to be giving guidance on the cost structure in 2016.","767":"The Windows 10 commercial component will look far more like our success and our motion and overall being able to sell the Microsoft 360 value prop.","768":"See, our overall vision for how computing evolves is that it's going to be more distributed, not less distributed.","769":"In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth.","770":"So sort of everywhere I look I see significant opportunity.","771":"Now, at the same time, in order to make this experience good, there also needs to be good content in the system, right, so we need to make sure that people have the tools to able to share the moments that they care about.","772":"And so that's what, that and our new products give us great confidence headed into this holiday season that this is going to be the best holiday season yet.","773":"So I would say, we do plan to continue to invest aggressively in the business going forward, and we are going to see, obviously, a margin impact from that in 2019.","774":"And so there will be volatility in this number, but the consistent theme of being double-digit billings that really match our strength in Office 365, I think -- and I do expect to continue.","775":"And, Walter, I think the way you see that show up is really in my conversation on FY 2019, to Satya's point, really we talked about that server product and KPI being high teens through FY 2019.","776":"And so I do think it will be a blend of those.","777":"If you think about our history, people made the shift to mobile before marketers did, and I think one of the successes we've had is we made it easier for advertisers to move into a mobile environment.","778":"I think we've made real improvements there, but I think there's a lot more we can do.","779":"So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.","780":"So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering.","781":"Over the last few years, we focused a lot on a number of major social issues everything from preventing election interference to reducing harmful content to protecting privacy.","782":"But we're going to need definitely continued support of our external transportation partners.","783":"We were very encouraged by the results this quarter.","784":"We do it with you know a combination of price and capability that we think is unmatched.","785":"And in fact, if anything, this release of Windows 10, just the way we have built it with the Insider program, everything is of course speeding up","786":"And so, the ecosystem there is very, very strong.","787":"So even with significant improvement again in, what Satya was talking about, some of the lower level IaaS and PaaS services within Azure, on the gross margin side you'll see some gross margin percentage pressure in that segment through 2019, but with significant dollar growth.","788":"With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact at a couple points either way, but I don't think about that as really immaterial impact.","789":"The main focus is on helping people capture and share any moment that they want, and also the whole theme that we have around community plays out a little bit differently on Instagram.","790":"So Messenger-only usage is not having a material impact on our overall usage stats.","791":"On that second point, in terms of how we think about the capacity we might have for our own, I think you know \u2013 I\u2019d start with, you know we\u2019ve got a great relationship with third party carriers across the countries where we operate.","792":"This is always going to be a lumpy business.","793":"So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy.","794":"So, when you think about segments the majority of these relate to the AWS segment.","795":"Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out.","796":"But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime.","797":"On the OEM side, the way to think about those comments is we do expect inventory levels to likely remain low as we exit the next quarter as well.","798":"We continue to believe we're delivering great ROI for advertisers.","799":"So I think less about it being cannibalistic","800":"and so it's is an area that we're focused on.","801":"So, I actually feel very good, but as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory that you are not seeing frankly much impact on the gross margin line and we are seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line.","802":"It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA program.","803":"So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp still stays about consistent as it was.","804":"So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products.","805":"In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know,","806":"On the other side, AppleCare, I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June, so really strong performance, but our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected, because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers.","807":"And the best articulation of this that I can make is that today, AI has different strengths than people do.","808":"The Azure pace is not, if you drew a line, as correlated to EAs as it even was 3 years ago, as we've I think matured the product and matured our sales cycles.","809":"We feel good about this lift-shift modernize motions that are happening.","810":"so it\u2019s really its entirety that we think of as our unique value","811":"And as we are more effective at getting direct response into Stories, that should improve, so some opportunity there.","812":"In terms of the ASP, the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price and so we don't want to charge more than that, and we think it's worth being fair.","813":"Yeah, we are seeing - as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing a good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally.","814":"We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market.","815":"As we look out into 2019 further, that's - the macro economy is certainly a potential headwind and risk to the business just given the sensitivity of the advertising business to a slowdown in growth.","816":"And then in terms of payments, there's multiple approaches that we're taking there.","817":"But right now, we're developing them somewhat independently.","818":"So there'll be more pricing pressure there","819":"We're pleased with the growth in time spent per DAU that we're seeing across the Facebook family of apps.","820":"On Ad Breaks for mid-roll video, early days pretty good result,","821":"And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work.","822":"On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth.","823":"So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here.","824":"We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware.","825":"We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth in engagement.","826":"So we think that will purge (40:38) some other demographic groups as well.","827":"In terms of regulation overall, I think that, that's going to be very important.","828":"And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things.","829":"So that is going to be the offset, and I mentioned particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment which is a headwind at this point.","830":"And the software team worked really hard to make that go back several versions of iPhone so that we sort of have hundreds of millions of enabled devices overnight.","831":"The video strategy is -- has been pretty consistent.","832":"And that product I think is a pretty revolutionary product","833":"I think we're just finally getting into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing and it's good to sort of see those in last quarter's results as well.","834":"So what we're seeing from DPA ads and carousel ads, we're really happy with.","835":"Obviously, those results would have been higher without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier.","836":"Our growth was really strong across all of our marketer segments, but we had a particularly good quarter in brands, I think driven by two things.","837":"And I would guess that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle.","838":"And so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward.","839":"So that\u2019s contributing to some of the deceleration, specifically as we look out into the remainder of 2019.","840":"On head count, I would just point out that our payroll growth tends to lag head count growth, because head count is an end-of-period number, so the acceleration that we're seeing in 2017 will obviously play out in 2018 as well.","841":"So that's what we've designed it for.","842":"As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen.","843":"But we feel fantastic, particularly as it pertains to iPhone X.","844":"So there is a lot of investment going on and there will be continued, especially related to Prime.","845":"Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales.","846":"The second component is what I would put in a bucket of new business.","847":"So it would be early to be talking about large shipment volumes.","848":"As you said, I mean at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially.","849":"Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold.","850":"And then of course, we are very excited about E5, but they're very, very early days of E5.","851":"This has been happening over multiple years, but we have now got very good customer momentum","852":"So I would say that I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that that was great work with a - on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built previously.","853":"And then our Cosmos DB has become the leading multi-model, multi-region database.","854":"So we're really pleased with what we're doing on the revenue front.","855":"So it's gone very well.","856":"And so, the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first line.","857":"As there are more Stories and feed, as more people are engaged in Facebook and increasingly in Instagram, that gives us more opportunities just on the supply side of ads.","858":"And so, that's how I measure progress.","859":"And as I'd indicated before, the China rebound was broad based across the products.","860":"but the focus is really to build a rev-share model over time that's sustainable.","861":"The first thing is we're seeing longer commitments.","862":"To your second question on Office -- I'm sorry, on Windows Commercial overall, our real investment -- and you're right, we are starting to reach some tougher comparables.","863":"So that should be well received by the Indian consumer base.","864":"But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 bps.","865":"So all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year.","866":"Yes, a couple things Brad.","867":"I think AR is big and profound and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it.","868":"And a lot of, I think, what we need to do is give people a way to see all of the videos that page that they like or follow is interested in sharing on Facebook.","869":"So, we\u2019re seeing strong growth across those platforms.","870":"And over the long-term, I think one of the big things that we need to do is see if we can not only make this good for engagement for our partners, but also a really positive business driver for them too.","871":"And those in addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion had been extremely well received.","872":"We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.","873":"And the answer is, it\u2019s a little bigger, but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year.","874":"So that's how we look at.","875":"And so, we plan on going in there with sort of all of our might.","876":"And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that \u2013 I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.","877":"The challenge is always going to be cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time.","878":"So that's clearly going to stay.","879":"So it's a number of factors, I would say.","880":"It has been remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets.","881":"And so that's been really a great story for us.","882":"And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution, not just on renewals in quarter, but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we\u2019ve seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed, because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction.","883":"And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain.","884":"If anything, all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly revenue driving growth.","885":"So, a combination of being able to understand the text that people message, read the articles that people would want to look at, watch the videos, look at the photos, are going to be great, too.","886":"And we still believe that over time every phone sold will be a smartphone.","887":"And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that.","888":"So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently.","889":"It's a very computationally and resource-intensive set of services that we provide and we need to build that out.","890":"Instagram has more heavy usage of Stories, so that's an area of continued growth opportunity because the effective levels of monetization in Stories are lower.","891":"So I would say the Prime membership to Prime flywheel, the additional benefits we are adding to Prime, not only in North America but also Internationally, and additional selection both retail and FBA which feeds the Prime flywheel.","892":"But our approach frankly is not changing over time.","893":"We are putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program.","894":"On Millennials, we were really pleased \u2013","895":"And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.","896":"But the core of our focus is still very much focused on ads and how we can do ads at the product level.","897":"On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line.","898":"In terms of larger developers, if you step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are two key constituencies in that equation.","899":"We also are incredibly happy to see the highest Android switcher rate that we've observed.","900":"Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers.","901":"Yes, we're very excited about the partnership with Adobe.","902":"So I would say that is a continuation of last year.","903":"And the advantage of that is also that some of those can be single player experiences.","904":"And so our task is to convince people that currently \u2013 or have another type of phone to switch, while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose \u2013 when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone.","905":"So we're seeing a lot of strength.","906":"Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa.","907":"So we're very ready to go.","908":"So we think about this part more holistically, and same thing with Dynamics.","909":"And we agree that we are underpenetrated there.","910":"And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers.","911":"As you've seen, we guided up sequentially in revenue.","912":"It's true in North America and our more developed markets within Europe, but I wouldn't say there's any real surprises there.","913":"We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year.","914":"So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1.","915":"And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe with looking at the results.","916":"I think this is going to be an exciting year.","917":"At the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling.","918":"So even going forward, there's going be revenue share back to the content creator, so it's going have a different margin structure than the core business.","919":"And so I think we\u2019ll be able to show the progress we\u2019ve made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward.","920":"So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting that segment.","921":"You know one of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands.","922":"And so what that shows is our growth is being driven by the ability of us to do this broad-based consumer media advertising but do it in a more targeted way.","923":"And then CapEx, we'll see continue to flow in through the P&L over time.","924":"And so we think that certainly we want to provide the best advertising, we certainly want to provide the best measurement, but our ability to do so as long as things happen across the industry, which is what's happening, I think we remain in a very strong position.","925":"And for that reason, we think mid-roll is a better user experience.","926":"So we would expect expense growth to ramp throughout the year, largely due to the factors that we've talked about on prior calls in terms of what's driving the overall acceleration.","927":"So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points.","928":"Watch and AirPods are doing incredibly well.","929":"The geos I specifically called out obviously were we're the most impacted and they're the bigger geos.","930":"So you will see more going forward.","931":"And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that activity that people want to do organically.","932":"In the last 18 months, we've doubled the number of paid Prime member, which we're very excited about.","933":"Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing.","934":"I think it's possible to get to the point in the next five to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things.","935":"We're very happy with that.","936":"Even this quarter is a great example.","937":"but we believe there are going to be opportunities as we further scale those properties.","938":"So I think that's going to constantly be a thing that plays into the desktop revenue.","939":"So let's start with the $239 million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we partnered with.","940":"So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we want to invest in over the next year and doing our long-range planning, and this is certainly one of the areas where I think we want to be investing a lot more in and believe that there's a big opportunity and can accelerate all the effort.","941":"Along with that, goes the advertising opportunities.","942":"Then, on top of it, we even have modernization of apps that is accelerating.","943":"And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers.","944":"And addition to the workloads Satya mentioned, I'll also bring up EMF.","945":"We do a very good job in terms of supply chain and being able to -- be able to get those up and running quite quickly.","946":"In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where we\u2019re outside of it, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a large step function increase.","947":"I mean, we obviously are focused on hiring top engineering talent.","948":"The team is doing a terrific job in terms of working on behalf of customers to pass on savings as they see it.","949":"I expect that actually to continue in Q2.","950":"I mean, these are really privacy-first products, and I think that, that's kind of the most important way that we're thinking about this whole space overall.","951":"And I think you're going to be able to look at these transparency reports as we issue them and see that we're continually making more progress, finding more of the content proactively, taking - getting better at taking it down, getting better at not distributing stuff that's borderline.","952":"We're encouraged by the improvements we've seen year over year.","953":"And we're going to invest both in people and technology","954":"That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this and we are hoping that calm heads prevail.","955":"So there's a lot of room to expand that and that's just a big opportunity for the Internet overall and for India over the next decade and we hope to play a role in that.","956":"It would be a huge difference.","957":"The improvement in that in Q3 is obviously very high margin and also the bottom.","958":"We can also invest selectively because we have more perfect information we know where our demand is, we know where we're moving things between warehouses and sort centers and by not involving third parties all the time, we can find that we can extend our ship cut offs, or excuse me, our order cutoffs and we've done that over the last few years.","959":"So, I'd say,

ad tech world, I think a lot is happening and there's a lot that's going to evolve in the whole ecosystem.","4":"And that is the reason why, again this year, we\u2019re allocating the majority of the increase, which is the largest increase that we\u2019ve ever done, we\u2019re increasing the program by $70 billion.","5":"because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch.","6":"And we want people to be able to share all of the things that are meaningful to them not just the things that are happy and that people are going to like when they see it.","7":"On Facebook, they took that ad and showed it to movie fans, Wizard of Oz fans and also people connected to accessibility causes.","8":"Well, the App Store is growing over 20%, it grew 25% last quarter, and we expect it to continue to grow at a strong double-digit rate in the coming quarters.","9":"Just really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017, it's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth along with time spent \u2013 user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand.","10":"And if you go beyond that, I feel good about our gaming business sequentially.","11":"We think marketplace is that.","12":"I, for the first time, talked about Cosmos DB.","13":"The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it.","14":"As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter.","15":"In fact, I'm looking forward to our partner conference to talk much more about what it is that we will be doing in the coming year to drive more success for our partners and in particular ISVs.","16":"We had VMware, and we had many other players we competed with and I grew up competing with.","17":"International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be in future quarters there.","18":"But Windows 10 is something that\u2019s completely optimized for the enterprise and across all same sizes for the mobile worker, as well as the desktop and large screens.","19":"So a lot of what is Dynamics field service is actually in our module growth we are seeing because of Azure IoT, and that relationship is not just about Azure PaaS.","20":"We really did see strength across all of them.","21":"So that's core basic messaging, the core functionality around having your real identity and connecting with all of your real friends and family online.","22":"So Air China is a good example.","23":"Of course, right, I mean these are large communities that people love and strongly associate with a specific app.","24":"We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers \u2013 for FBA sellers.","25":"And on the server question you asked at the beginning, let me say that we did see I think around 9% constant currency growth of the core server product, and a lot of that was premium driven.","26":"And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1.","27":"They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter.","28":"The second thing is video.","29":"But there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth so time spent per person.","30":"I mean we think it'll be good for the business over the long-term, but this is what people are telling us is what they want on the product.","31":"So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas things like Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high-end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate or nearly twice that rate based on total headcount.","32":"They are going to be high sometimes and they'll be moderated at other times.","33":"You can buy Audience Network.","34":"We have Facebook Marketplace for that.","35":"I would say that, one, our products aren't simple enough yet, because they can never be simple

there\u2019s great value in the stock.","37":"Even the customer examples I gave, they were littered with example after example.","38":"We also expect to continue to invest in marketing and advertising.","39":"Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing.","40":"So that runs the gamut from smart thermostat and another smart home devices, headphones, but also vehicle.","41":"Some of these services are scaling quickly and so we tend to expand gross margins there.","42":"The very best example, frankly, as Satya mentioned in his comments, which is our EMS performance, Enterprise Mobility Suite offerings.","43":"Certainly, with different groups of people, it's stronger on Instagram or WhatsApp or Facebook, but across all three at this point, it's growing.","44":"We have the delivery services \u2013 so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need.","45":"This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are \u2013 Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by \u2013 units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA.","46":"I have to say that it's been remarkable.","47":"I mentioned iCloud, and so it all adds up.","48":"And that was a couple points of impact, for example on OEM Pro in quarter.","49":"I mean, WhatsApp is more of a clear text messaging replacement.","50":"And as I said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report at the March quarter and that will include talking about timeframes and pace and so on.","51":"I think on a recent earnings call we just announced that we passed 1 billion searches total so now being more than 1 billion on mobile shows some progress that I'm pretty proud of for the search team.","52":"But I think in consumer, it\u2019s maybe the easiest one to talk about, is that we talked about license growth of 10%, when you correct for Japan.","53":"For me, what I think is missing in that question is really \u2013 it's not about any one customer saying wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more.","54":"On the question around channel inventory, we entered the quarter, the December quarter -- and we mentioned it back in October below our target range of five to seven weeks.","55":"It's very similar to what happened even in the client server era, but of course the starting points and how this progresses is very different.","56":"Customers save millions.","57":"By running across Facebook Stories and Instagram Stories, they drove 20% more leads than our other digital campaigns.","58":"And also the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter.","59":"But our fulfillment costs per unit actually decreased year-over-year.","60":"My hats off to operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was Christmas in July quite frankly, a bigger day than Black Friday, as we've said and orders increased 266% year-over-year.","61":"And then of course, ads, we've got 60 million businesses with pages.","62":"So you're coming up against a bigger business last year than we had in the past.","63":"But our first priority, every time, is to make sure we are focused on annuity growth and digital transformation at our company, which is best done through that motion.","64":"Same thing on server management, we have a new suite called the Operations Management Suite, which also spans all the cloud units as well as on-premise units.","65":"As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself.","66":"And then the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end.","67":"But a lot of that comparability, which you referenced, is due a little bit of how it's licensed, which is a lot of this is new and gets recognized more upfront in quarter.","68":"As I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in computers, do not provide quarterly unit sales information either.","69":"So if you look even at our announcements over this quarter, a lot of what we have done with IoT is create an IoT edge.","70":"But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply constrained on 7 and 7 Plus.","71":"We have robust device business including the launch of a new Paperwhite Fire TV Echo with general availability and numerous other products that we're very excited about.","72":"We're trying to help them measure.","73":"We continue to have healthy investments as we've stated across the globe.","74":"We are seeing people move more and more of their workflows to AWS and at a faster pace.","75":"The core ethos of LinkedIn needs be about member-first.","76":"It's certainly something we're working on vertical-by-vertical.","77":"The combination of those two things and the opportunity we see is the reason in the sales re-org that we did in July, we continue to put resources and sales resources behind collaboration and communication, and so many of the important workloads that allow us to give great value to customers.","78":"Whereas now with the cloud for the first time we now can serve both individuals as well as small businesses with the same kind of sophistication that in the past was exclusively available for the large enterprises.","79":"I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin improvement across all those services.","80":"As it relates to margin profile, you also just have the factor that you're increasing growth \u2013 the increasing mix of the business is shifting towards Asia and towards what are currently lower ARPU markets.","81":"because there\u2019s different characteristics of Stories versus Feed, because you have effectively rolls of video when people are posting lots of Stories, and the interstitials are in between the rolls.","82":"We do not manage this company quarter to quarter.","83":"because as we look at the usage statistics on iPad, it remains unbelievably great.","84":"It allows them to better tell customers who they are share their story.","85":"One of those is the video content investment.","86":"Obviously, on the safety and security side, those are costs that are layering in that we think are the right thing to do for the business but don't necessarily have a revenue impact.","87":"Today, for the most part, people pull Facebook out when they have a few minutes, when they want to catch up and see what's going on in the world with their friends and in the news and everything that's going on.","88":"It's the same case with Boeing.","89":"That is important in the enterprise and that\u2019s what we are building towards with great management and great security.","90":"And the last quarter we gave an indication of the growth rates after being added for 10 year.","91":"We continue to open retail stores around the world.","92":"And that is not just the case for the aggregate of the growing community, but it's actually also the case on a per-person basis as well in terms of people sharing more and spending more time individually.","93":"I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015 and that was up 40% year-over-year.","94":"It goes without saying strong U.S. dollar has negative impact on our international business.","95":"The better we can do with dealers and with auto manufacturers at measuring all the way through the purchase, the better off we are.","96":"That\u2019s gone through a fee change both because of the hardware innovation, innovation in Windows, innovation in Office.","97":"So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015.","98":"To give you a comparison, when we launched the iPhone, we had about 500 apps that were ready.","99":"But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next \u2013 in the coming year.","100":"There are differences in adoption of the cloud.","101":"They started in Sweden on Facebook.","102":"Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage.","103":"So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment in warehouses.","104":"Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with Air Transport Services Group, an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s there, and similar use case, it's products that are already boxed.","105":"We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals.","106":"That was up 36% year-over-year.","107":"We see what products you use within Facebook or Instagram, or Facebook and Instagram, as less important as the best products for the right marketer at the right time to drive their business results.","108":"If I look at whether it's IoT or AI, the two workloads that are new, both of them require both computation and intelligence on the edge and a very new way to do even computation, which event-driven computation.","109":"And it\u2019s new penetration, so it\u2019s not even a one-for-one replacement, even for the enterprise customer there consumption is going up.","110":"I think it's important to note that GDPR is affecting the entire online advertising industry.","111":"In terms of conversion rates, I\u2019d probably just go back to the discussion that we had on pricing and the fact that we\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of supply opportunity, and pricing is clearly lower on Stories than on Feed.","112":"And part of the results you see from us in different verticals are actually explained by the ability of us to help those marketers measure sales at the end of the day.","113":"because when people spend time viewing more posts because they're interacting with family and friends and they're not involved in longer post.","114":"We do like the fact that it creates a market for an iPhone at a different price point as well that is a better product than that customer maybe currently buying which would further help from an ecosystem point of view and that's not to be underestimated.","115":"There was an internet shutdown in Ethiopia that contributed a little bit to that.","116":"Tim has talked about Apple Pay.","117":"So I mentioned this stat earlier that we have about 33,000 bots that are live in Messenger, including experiences across a range of verticals, from news to e-commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things, and we're seeing some early progress.","118":"because of the FX situation, right.","119":"You know, we have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that they want to get to and look at in search.","120":"And if you look at this last quarter, our annuity grew double digits and our cloud grew triple digits.","121":"In general what we have to do is we use computers and AI for what they're good for which is looking at a lot of content very quickly and making quick judgments.","122":"IoT, for example, was not a workload on the old server world, whereas it's one of the big workloads for us.","123":"For the News Feed question, the North Star for us in News Feed is that we want to produce the best experience for everyone who is using the app and loading News Feed to see what is going on in the world around them, right?","124":"We have the ability to now tier even the database with the cloud.","125":"But hopefully that is a temporary condition.","126":"For example, one of the things that we see the most traction for HoloLens is with first-line workers.","127":"The revenue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double-digits.","128":"And from an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back perhaps but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really began this year","129":"Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on that number was $49.","130":"Are we investing in the right types of people, in the right capabilities?","131":"So we are building some capacity ahead of our immediate needs.","132":"And the more we \u2013 the better we get at measuring those returns, the better the ads get.","133":"There is IoT.","134":"So that I think will also transcend or lead into even media companies.","135":"And Sheryl alluded to it in her earlier commentary about if we get better at converting our impressions into things that are valuable for advertisers and we get more efficient in doing that, we'll be rewarded with better pricing and higher demand at better pricing as a result of that hard work.","136":"There's many different use cases.","137":"But as you can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 billion impact in Q2 2020.","138":"There\u2019s a much larger breadth of possibilities here for customers than in our other products.","139":"And so if you do that, our guidance is actually 8% to 11% because we have about a 700 basis point FX headwind in Q1.","140":"And this is something that they've always focused on.","141":"We've rolled out in all countries where we offer Facebook ads.","142":"And I love magazines.","143":"It's going to open up a much greater diversity of use cases, not only making it so that use cases like facemasks or style transfers that we already have, you're now going to have thousands of options instead of just 10 or 20 at a time.","144":"And this tough compare eventually isn't the benchmark.","145":"And CRM has taken our own Dynamics product, has taken some pretty unique approaches.","146":"And we've got a goal of bringing more than 10 million online by 2025.","147":"We use those primarily for movement between our warehouses and our source centers.","148":"because of some of the core capabilities of Windows 10 when it comes to security, manageability.","149":"I know both of them will matter and both of them are important, and so that\u2019s why I tend to focus on that all up server KPI combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the edge which is the on-prem.","150":"We see a lot of organic connections between businesses and consumers, and our experience is that where are those \u2013 where we have those organic connections, that's very promising to turn that into monetization as well.","151":"There's some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses.","152":"I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third party units.","153":"One of them recently was LEGO.","154":"In particular, we now have a subscription offer with Game Pass that's off to a good very good start and our goal is to be able to have essentially a Netflix for games, so that we can have the game subscriptions that people can use across all of the devices that they play in.","155":"And that's because we've built up engineering locations in key areas like Seattle, London, New York, Boston, Tel Aviv.","156":"And so obviously at some point if those technologies move to lower price points and that there's probably more unit demand.","157":"So we're seeing good diversified growth.","158":"We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as they move into the program.","159":"So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth, but the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both of those numbers.","160":"We do realize it's a capital-intensive business and we have modeling that shows it's going to be a very \u2013 it is a very good business for us and that's what we aim for as long-term return on invested capital and free cash flow.","161":"A lot of the work that we end up doing goes towards making it easier for small businesses to be able to -- without a big technology shop, be able to use the same tools, get access to payments, set up storefronts easily, being able to measure the effectiveness of ads.","162":"Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audiences.","163":"The -- I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway we grew finance leases, which is essentially our props for capital leases for infrastructure by 9% in Q1 and it was 10% all of last year coming off a year in 2017 where we had growth of 69%.","164":"I see AR as being profound.","165":"Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter, from Japan to Brazil to India, some even stronger numbers than that in Russia.","166":"Now, this all goes to the balance sheet.","167":"So a recent example, HTC working with their agency Swift did Instagram videos to raise awareness of their mobile device warranty program.","168":"And so, by the time you move all of that out of the comparison group, you really get back to very similar trends in our D&C licensing business that we saw this quarter for what I think was a component to you are focused on which is OEM Pro and OEM non-Pro, which we expect to really resemble the results we saw this quarter and marry -- and to matched up PC business dynamics overall.","169":"The next component which is a change is we have actually launched some of our Office 365 consumer services in Japan, which is a Geo that we had not been in historically.","170":"We saw a little bit more impact of E5 this quarter in ARPU than we have been seeing.","171":"This is very small still.","172":"So, again, signed a number of big customers.","173":"I don't have the percentage of exactly how many customers are working on this type of measurement with us.","174":"All of that is transforming Maersk.","175":"In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services.","176":"Let's just take for example what's happening in a factory.","177":"I do think the work we showed at the analyst meeting on the importance of increasing the install base across Office and Exchange, that it did occur again this quarter.","178":"Feed is fundamentally about information being pushed to a consumer and us helping figure out what is most interesting and most engaging and I think, in many ways, positive for people.","179":"And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa.","180":"One of the examples I showed at F8 was around using object recognition and computer vision to be able to point your camera at something and then tap on it and get a card of information and maybe even a buy button.","181":"The three largest countries were India, the U.S. and Brazil.","182":"so in the near-term we're investing to grow the community, execute on the existing business, both on the product side and then the advertising and sales force side.","183":"It's a lot lower.","184":"There's also discounts for other groups.","185":"So video is having an impact, but we grew expenses 39% year-over-year in the first quarter.","186":"If we had not gotten started on some of the distributed computing infrastructure in a completely different place, we wouldn't have even had Azure.","187":"We're very focused on the privacy of what people do, wherever they do it, and using the information we have in a very responsible way.","188":"We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins.","189":"And we think that that's going to be positive, right.","190":"We had over 350 significant new features and services and we believe that's what resonates with customers.","191":"Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable.","192":"And for example, they would target in the U.S. age 18 and above frequent international travelers living in cities where they had routes or Indian expats living in the U.S. to promote new routes to Mumbai.","193":"And now the professional cloud or the professional network helps usage across all of that professional usage.","194":"We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion on mobile platform in China.","195":"And in order to promote things both in and what we\u2019re doing on Instagram with shopping and in Facebook Marketplace and in the general approach to payments is providing as affordably as possible to improve the user experience and complete transactions which will of course make the tools more valuable for businesses overall and should make the ad prices go up.","196":"One is this true distributed hybrid.","197":"And we're continuing to invest across the board in terms of our core R&D and innovation efforts in terms of headcount growth there.","198":"And that's a fine way and we'll keep account of it, but that's not how it works.","199":"If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the iPhone Xs in the U.S. the same as we priced the iPhone X a year ago.","200":"But the key is even the consumption services come in different forms, there is the IR services, there is the data services, and some of the higher level services.","201":"We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years.","202":"We launched hashtag following in December.","203":"because these two factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat.","204":"We see a lot of growth in our data, both in terms of infrastructure but in the new services like our Data Lake services which are PaaS services.","205":"So for example, automatic placements, what automatic placements do is they convert Feed ads into a Stories format and deliver the ads wherever they get their best results.","206":"We sometimes talk about it as some stopping creative, where you actually want to stop and watch.","207":"So I think this is one where my optimism, frankly, for the structure of the market in the segment you chose, and my optimism for our positioning within that market is reflected in that investment number that you have seen.","208":"And going forward, we have a fantastic lineup of servers, not just the infrastructure, but even SharePoint, Exchange, Lync Server continues to have significant on-premise deployment.","209":"And so in terms of the Siri access point, as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions.","210":"And I think that's really what's allowing us to improve yield and effectively driving higher effective CPMs for us while still delivering business outcomes to them at attractive ROIs.","211":"I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest \u2013 if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the services revenue, so it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously, and 30,000 or so subscription apps.","212":"With the auto industry, really important industry for growth for us, helping them figure out who their current customers are, who their potential customers are and where are the audience segments out there who have similar likes, interests, backgrounds, demographics to their current customers so that they can serve right ad to the right people.","213":"It continues to make an increasing contribution to the business.","214":"And that backend in many cases in regulator industries with the GEO participation we have is needed everywhere.","215":"We have Amazon Devices.","216":"And so it can make a bit of a distraction towards seen the underlying trends.","217":"We continue to see growth in users.","218":"Those are things that we just think are just going to be ubiquitous.","219":"In terms of the strength that we're seeing in the U.S. and Canada on the revenue front, obviously, Instagram is playing a big, big role there and the growth of impressions from Stories is factoring into it.","220":"And that matters to multinational companies but also are trying to operate across many geographies and jurisdictions.","221":"So they want local compute.","222":"And in fact, this last quarter, some of the most strategic announcements were all around our application platform.","223":"because it can make their ad serving and buying more efficient across the platforms they use.","224":"You can click through or tap through to a message thread, and then you can either get customer support or complete a transaction or do a follow-on transaction.","225":"And I think what you're seeing is that as we enable more use cases and as we just get a lot of the basics right around performance and bringing the mobile features into parity and beyond what we've been able to do on desktop, the volume is growing quickly.","226":"This has been a dream of mine for, I don't know, for 15 years probably.","227":"There's a lot of demand that comes in the last six weeks of the year as well.","228":"It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers.","229":"After all we did run large-scale consumer services ourselves between Xbox LIVE and Bing.","230":"It is the place you will look and see that number and outside of that I mean those really are the biggest contributors.","231":"And so there would have been some switchers on top of that from other operating systems, but obviously android is the largest one by far.","232":"So we have great relationships with third party carriers.","233":"operating margin was up from 3.9% in Q1 and 3% last Q2.","234":"In addition, I mentioned video content as being a driver.","235":"The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business.","236":"In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and app content, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for online stores revenue.","237":"Obviously, when we come down to capital allocation decisions, we obviously also keep in mind that the opportunity for us to do some M&A activities which we do in an ongoing basis.","238":"So within that context, we're not breaking out specific cohorts, but we remain a great place for advertisers to reach Millennials.","239":"In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers.","240":"They've done a great job of implementing a lot of iOS features in their apps and we're looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.","241":"And that\u2019s something that we have the capability of doing, and we want to be able to do that in a disciplined way.","242":"And we've seen experiences both in terms of a lighthearted like Candace Payne and also more serious, more serious issues around the U.S. and around the globe.","243":"At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was.","244":"Right now, a lot of what people are sharing are their social videos and content.","245":"And if your goal is to connect to everyone and make sure that people can all participate, that ads-based model makes a lot of sense and we're going to continue to invest very heavily there.","246":"PC gaming is a growth market.","247":"We see in fact increased engagement with titles like Minecraft.","248":"For the first time in fact, in our own Microsoft history, we have an extensibility model that is the same for Office 365 and Dynamics 365.","249":"But you don\u2019t need to build out data centers much before they\u2019re really being utilized.","250":"We even see, obviously, the end-user parts of the infrastructure when it comes to enterprise mobility.","251":"They come back in and they pay less for the service but they pay more for their smartphone.","252":"It has to go all the way through for this to work from discovery, all the way through a pretty seamless checkout flow.","253":"Gene, if you look at the overall worldwide, we grew iPhone 40%.","254":"Because increasingly, there will be more devices and we want to make sure that we're adding value and if we add value in that context, you will be more inclined to retain or purchase the Office subscription.","255":"You need hybrid and guess what, today in 2019, hybrid has become much more main stream.","256":"It could be as someone coming from Office 365.","257":"Because it's super-important for us in this phase when people are looking for solutions to help them visually transform, for us to have a very fundamentally different type of capability in terms of our sales, and that's the transformation.","258":"And if we can drive those affectively that will translate into higher effective prices for our business.","259":"because that's part of our seasonal pattern, which gets offset by a favorable commodity environment that we've seen for a number of quarters now.","260":"There are also good partnerships in place now across the industry, across law enforcement, the intelligence communities, not just in the U.S. but across other countries, too.","261":"But we're getting good feedback on that upfront.","262":"I mean, we grew 87% in China.","263":"In terms of the other things that we're doing, we have some great capability and great teams in Apple.","264":"We had automatic default templates which convert your feed ads into vertical Stories format and this quarter we just launched customizable templates, which help you save time and resources.","265":"Just to size it for you, the impact of memory on our gross margin is 40 bps sequentially and 110 bps on a year over year basis.","266":"For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone.","267":"And I think as of a few minutes ago, the first sales started in Australia.","268":"And so on occasion what that does, even with the negative currency impact on C&B, is have a bit of lumpiness over time.","269":"We've garnered awards, of course, but mainly that what we're focused on is good content that is attractive to customers.","270":"They saw a three times increase in their online bookings and I think those kind of results are made possible by more vertical-specific products","271":"because a lot of people will move an existing workload into the cloud.","272":"I would say globally especially outside the US, we saw good improvements around -- engagement around video.","273":"So the full pickup on that year-over-year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that.","274":"This is a decision we made many, many years ago in some sense inception of Azure was built for a future which is much more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client server area.","275":"As you pointed out, there is a couple components that make gross profit dollars per seat or the life time value of a customer depending on the terms you want to use improve and increase over the life cycle.","276":"And when you look at the consumer time we get, we are not getting the equivalent amount of time or resources from our marketers really of any size, and therein lies our opportunity to grow.","277":"Same thing with data, the DocumentDB is a massive thing for us.","278":"The second way is AirPlay 2, which we have as just pointed out we have support on a number of different third-party TVs.","279":"It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter.","280":"And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year.","281":"But most importantly, architectural benefit for customers because by having incoherence around these layers is where you may feel like you're making some great best-of-breed sort of choices in individual layers, but you'll bear that expense in your overall agility as well as your overall management of your data","282":"Even last quarter, political spending even within the U.S. alone was not a top-10 vertical for us.","283":"And while we have opportunities to grow impressions on Facebook and Instagram, that's less so in feed, where we already have healthy ad loads in - on both surfaces and more in Stories where we have lower CPMs.","284":"And I will just add that we're also making pretty significant changes in just the very workflow of our engineering teams and that also leads to us getting more out of our current investments.","285":"And this happened very quickly, right?","286":"So, for example, we have this Pages Manager App.","287":"It's coming in talent.","288":"We've learned that we can't just rely on teaching our clients and teaching the ad agencies to do it, but helping them do that.","289":"It's about the investment we've made in capability, the evolution of the product and its innovation.","290":"I mean this whole trend is much newer than the trend with News Feed and feeds overall and it continues to grow incredibly quickly.","291":"This quarter was particularly strong for brand, are really recognizing that they can do big brand buys on our platform like they would do on TV, but make them much more targeted.","292":"So that workflow, we have every layer of it.","293":"And we also benefited from the extra day in the quarter due to the leap year, but strong performance from many of the categories","294":"They're easy to build.","295":"It then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through servers that we used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our own Amazon businesses.","296":"That's the same case with GE.","297":"Right, I would say actually we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency, 7% before LinkedIn.","298":"Instagram is clearly making a contribution and as is the Audience Network.","299":"They're selling girls' clothing.","300":"And there are going to need to be big advances there, but that's really exciting.","301":"So if you were to exclude that foreign exchange impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in margins.","302":"I mean one of the things that I always think about it, for all the success we\u2019ve had in our server business, we were a low share player.","303":"In my opening commentary, I talked a little bit about both the increased visits to the Store and transactions as well as the fact that we are attracting new applications from developers like Netflix to Wall Street Journal to others.","304":"And in fact, it's not about in fact taking any old workload per se, but it's about reimagining what they want to do across these.","305":"But generally, just strong usage growth -- usage growth continues to be strong growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate, and customers continued to add workloads and expand.","306":"They worked with agencies Horizon, David & Goliath and Adaptly, and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create two different custom audience groups.","307":"And quite frankly, I was the one who opened up our communications and collaborations for other CRM vendors.","308":"When you see the Dynamics 365 growth or Azure IoT growth, taking every IoT project, it ends up as a field service project, so that's a classic way somebody says, let me sense something, predict something and then actually fix using field service.","309":"Is this something that the world needs Microsoft to be doing, or is it well served by others?","310":"And as you know, we work with our hedging program where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term.","311":"In fact we amortize our CapEx across all of these and we pay attention to margin and premium mix.","312":"Customers are relying on us for not only that footprint, but as they continue to expand to sit under the Tier 1 opportunity we haven't seen before.","313":"There are a number of other things that we're doing too, including creating an external program for independent academics to study how the impact of social media and how foreign governments try to interfere in elections.","314":"Of course, we have done smaller acquisitions, but they add up.","315":"It can start with some of our devices in the first-line worker.","316":"I think where you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now, and so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that.","317":"It\u2019s one common infrastructure and one common data center footprint between O365 Azure, CRM, Xbox Live everything.","318":"You can buy the different ad formats within Facebook and Instagram.","319":"So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown \u2013 we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis.","320":"We have content from Japan to Korea to many countries, and we have great content from China as well, and so there are many hands in the products.","321":"The global growth rate was 53% and North America growth rate was 50%.","322":"It's not just the Silicon Valley startups anymore, it is the core enterprise that is also becoming a digital company and we are well positioned to serve them and that's good to see.","323":"We are using payments in some of our other products in ways that enable some of the interactions we want to see.","324":"And the targeting that is custom audiences underlies all of our product offerings.","325":"because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content, you come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience.","326":"It's becoming essential.","327":"And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically on the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent.","328":"If you look at the 8 and 8 Plus, when we launched them, they instantly became our top two selling products.","329":"So now what we're trying to do is just increase the SLAs that we have across all of these different types of content and security threats that we might see.","330":"I see it every day in my Outlook Mobile.","331":"I think people just would watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that.","332":"And like the rest of the world, or most of the rest of the world, IDC is projecting that PC sales in China contracted by 5% last quarter.","333":"This can be a long-term virtuous cycle and sustainable business model in way that we can help support journalism.","334":"And so what we have right now, which is a situation, it\u2019s not surprising to us, we knew we would be here, is that the watch gross margins for the current quarter that we\u2019ve included in the guidance that Luca\u2019s provided in the aggregate, are lower than the company average.","335":"Their business owner, Joanna [Cariello], took photos of her products on her phone and then created ads with our Shop Now button.","336":"There's also \u2013 in that line item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video and digital music.","337":"Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking forward to.","338":"So when we talk about enterprise management suite growth, a lot of it is just obviously is management growth, but it's also security and data protection growth.","339":"If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter.","340":"We continue to add selection.","341":"We are also seeing a great efficiency in the business on a cost basis.","342":"Operating income last year was $1 billion.","343":"And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we - Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees.","344":"So for example, while there is no formal groups product on Instagram, people use Explore.","345":"Same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia but also many places in Western Europe as well.","346":"I mean, the hearings didn't just touch on that.","347":"And Instagram creates a pure experience that's focused on photos and videos.","348":"And they're inherently less efficient than more established mature buildings, so there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.","349":"We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will.","350":"We are nowhere near serving that as well as we want to.","351":"So that's why we have a very long-term view on Quantum, and the things that we did even in this last quarter is take things like the quantum simulator stuff and bring it to Azure.","352":"Our customers are telling us that.","353":"With Rift, it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s early in the evolution of VR; it\u2019s early to be talking about large volumes.","354":"Line item is growing at about the same rate.","355":"And it's the fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million.","356":"But this year or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G and we couldn't be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhone to produce that great experience for people.","357":"And obviously, Instagram is continuing to grow nicely as well, so that's another contributing factor there.","358":"I would like to point out that the ever year major product hit a high on the active install base.","359":"So the Office commercial business grew 5%.","360":"And so many of those were sold into emerging markets, not all of them, but many of them.","361":"We\u2019ve done a bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly, broadly targeted on Facebook.","362":"We've built our business around price selection and convenience.","363":"The iPhone 6s is the most popular iPhone that we currently sell.","364":"That\u2019s what you see when we see our subscription growth in consumer, we see subscription growth in small business these are folks who never bought a server from us.","365":"because the best of the people creating those shows and starring in those shows are also engaging with Facebook, and I think the vision Mark laid out for this all along is that, we should do video in a pretty social way.","366":"Faster outside, data that we gave at the end of the year.","367":"And they saw 9.3 times return of investment over the two week holiday period.","368":"because we're delivering growth against a much larger scale News Feed business in the prior-year period and also, of course, headwinds are an impact as well, as you mentioned.","369":"Whereas on Facebook Messenger, the graph is your friends, and you're more likely to, say, wish an acquaintance happy birthday on Facebook Messenger than on WhatsApp or you might not have their phone number in the first place.","370":"And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago.","371":"And so we don't enter into those with no experience, although we will enter into them humbly.","372":"That I think is going to create great value for enterprises, and that's showing up in all the pilots.","373":"We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result.","374":"I'd say commerce broadly and e-commerce is an important vertical for our advertising business.","375":"You've got the impact of the opt-outs on one side, but on the other hand, we've seen strong growth in our digital subscriptions.","376":"That's going to integrate more than 30,000 facilities and 1,500 suppliers and partners in Volkswagen's global supply chain over time.","377":"Under the old methodology we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter.","378":"We've seen great response from customers.","379":"We think we can do that in a privacy-protected way, and it's just a better experience.","380":"We build and then build businesses around these apps.","381":"Prime Now, I guess, my comments are that, it's in 50 cities worldwide, it's across 9 countries.","382":"Lastly, even when it's comes to devices, we want to take an approach that brings all assistants.","383":"We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning.","384":"I think it's a huge opportunity.","385":"We have Linux is first class","386":"And I would say if anything, the initial data from our customers around security is gaining a lot of traction.","387":"There were not any one-time benefits in this quarter that helped us.","388":"It is a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365 and it includes EMS.","389":"So that\u2019s what hopefully gives you a flavor for the IP that we have.","390":"It's key to our 2017 goals and executing on our three, five, and 10-year roadmap, the one that Mark outlined.","391":"Most of that is for the AWS business.","392":"A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to succeed and grow their online businesses, you'll see from our press release that we've launched a new apps for that.","393":"And on that front, we\u2019re -- substantial majority of our expenses are U.S. dollar base.","394":"We think there's a lot of opportunity for people to have commercial intent, if not have it when they start, but develop it because they see things they're interested in, in both.","395":"You also have to keep in mind that we're making large investments in India.","396":"Oh, I think there's no doubt if you look at it we are expanding the market size in those areas.","397":"Yeah, so as we mentioned, the ASP for iPhone was up $99, 18% increase year-over-year and this is really driven by the mix, by the fact that we've added iPhone 6 Plus to a new price point and in general, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio.","398":"We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits.","399":"We have the premium part of our line is the 6s and the 6s Plus.","400":"And I think as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we've seen there so far.","401":"I mean, GEICO example is a good one.","402":"But some of \u2013 the vast majority of the content that's consumed on Facebook just talking about video right now is people browsing through feed.","403":"And the cost is also high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs.","404":"we recognize the majority of our third-party advertising revenues of the Audience Network on a net rather than gross basis.","405":"One is the case of the mix shift to Azure as it grows at the pace we're seeing it does impact quarter to quarter.","406":"And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%.","407":"In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves.","408":"We've had a really nice program in extra internships where we're taking people who are not yet majoring in computer science but we think have the ability, and teaching them for a summer and seeing them return, to the work we're doing with our female engineers to make sure that all forms of bias are surfaced and eliminated.","409":"And so, that has a factor on desktop growth.","410":"We think that, working together with them we can expand on that in the future.","411":"I would say during the course of the quarter the biggest impact came from the Japanese yen, the Russian rubel, but also from euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar.","412":"And when we get to Q4 we\u2019re going to be lapping some particularly successful optimizations that we had in Q4 and that\u2019s going to contribute to more of a decel in Q4 than we think we\u2019ll see in Q3.","413":"And continually again AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem, and also the stronger security that we offer.","414":"It adds - if it's in the FBA program, it adds Prime eligible selection.","415":"As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we set a record from switchers from other platforms, the largest we've ever seen in any six-month period before, so we've got traction there.","416":"We\u2019re obviously -- we're just in the U.S. right now and so there's tons of countries to go to and there is not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t get notes from many businesses outside U.S. running Apple Pay and banks and merchants.","417":"It's been double-digit consistent growth.","418":"Stories it is the biggest individual driver of impression growth, and we talked about how that is coming through at lower prices.","419":"One of the new suites we have is called F1 and this is about first-line work.","420":"We opened up a Amazon four-star location in New York City where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon.","421":"We're able to do more business objectives, all of which can use the same targeting as we have on Facebook and all of which are increasingly tapping into our measurement capabilities.","422":"In terms of what's going on with iPhone, the 35% growth is almost three times the market.","423":"It's the reason for Apple TV and what we're doing in the living room.","424":"Another example is just spam filtering and just making sure that we can actually read the content and understand what's interesting to you or not and not show that.","425":"I don\u2019t want to miss this one other big scenario which is Cortana , that\u2019s perhaps the thing that\u2019s going to change personal productivity even most and especially with Windows 10 and how Cortana comes to Windows, both to the browser as well as to the start, I think it completely change what personal productivity software mean from a day-to-day experience as well.","426":"If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year, at the end of the year.","427":"So, that means there\u2019s a bunch of workloads that are migrating to the cloud, people use both Azure Stack plus Azure.","428":"When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing.","429":"The gross margins are impacted by first party versus third party mix, as well as AWS mix if you're looking at the total for the company.","430":"The overall commercial cloud revenue mix, but I would also say the directionality of the Azure gross margin for example which recent significantly improved we expect to continue.","431":"We think our website is very tuned to selling online.","432":"If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top three selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was number one and has been for a couple of quarters, and iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the U.S., UK and Japan.","433":"And it obviously also fuels the services business.","434":"That's another theme that we have.","435":"And then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter which are not going to repeat this year.","436":"So we've said often that we think that virtual reality and augmented reality could be the next big computing platform.","437":"I think in the last quarter, you saw in health care, in retail, in financial services.","438":"And if you think about the connection to why that happens it's not just a terrific engineering work that we've done in product value, it's also the investments that we've made to put resources and some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud and we've added resources that we're seeing the revenue get recaptured in that way.","439":"We see customers have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS Database Migration Service.","440":"And so we are now in a position where we have $285 billion of cash, we've got $122 billion of debt for a net cash of $163 billion.","441":"But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year.","442":"not that no one event drives our business, we're pretty large and diversified.","443":"of people who start advertising with us start with our really simple ad products.","444":"Total bookings, because the volatility frankly in consumer businesses in times like the holiday periods, it can make it far more volatile than usually what many of you have been asking for, which is the continuity and health of the overall commercial business.","445":"It can be someone coming from Azure, Dynamics, EMS.","446":"Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods, it was purchased in August of last year and that has impacted every quarter since then, Q4 will be the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them since Q2 of last year.","447":"India, we set a new first-half record.","448":"But along with the bookstores, we also have \u2013 you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points.","449":"We have a partnership with them on e-signatures.","450":"because our market share is extremely high.","451":"We right now are working on getting the capacity in.","452":"And we had things like same-day delivery which we talked about.","453":"Then, and this is where it gets even more interesting, they retargeted people who watched the video with over 500 personalized video ads which were optimized for Facebook and Instagram.","454":"If you think about gross margins in particular, what you'll see is Azure continuing to be a growing percentage of the total revenue growth.","455":"So nothing specific to call out on that.","456":"That tends to have a very good margin profile.","457":"As you know the -- gaming is the top category on the App Store.","458":"We're really working on shifting people to understanding what their real objectives are so that they can focus on driving businesses.","459":"The first and the largest issue is the end of the Nokia commercial agreement that\u2019s about $650 million that we earned in Q2 of a year ago that because of the ended the agreement simply goes away.","460":"because we've constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off the charts you can wind up doing fairly well over time.","461":"It makes the experience in the living room with people using our products even better.","462":"So I am not waiting for some future date to see ROI from AI, we're very much going forward even the office tools example I used.","463":"When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014 about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program.","464":"We made acquisitions when they made sense.","465":"And so if you look at then our ability to grow in the Azure would be larger or over any period of time then ARPU seat or per user businesses it certainly could be but I don\u2019t want that to really diminish the fact that there is a lot of room for us and our per seat businesses particularly across LinkedIn, the Power platform work we're doing.","466":"If you look in China, it's over 70%.","467":"Outlook is the email client for Windows.","468":"And so you build the computer system, in that way they can flag and get rid of some of the worst stuff, and so they can flag for human review, some of the stuff that's borderline and then there's just so much content flowing through the system that we do need a lot of people looking at this.","469":"We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year.","470":"One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads.","471":"I had a recent trip, where I was in Berlin and Dublin, talking to a bunch of folks, who are policymakers or academics out there.","472":"Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line.","473":"because it has a lot of potential.","474":"We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain.","475":"But a lot of what we can get at are recommendations on products and travel and restaurants and things that your friends have shared, they haven't shared publicly, and knowing different correlations, or interesting things about what your friends are interested in, and that's the type of stuff, those are questions that we can answer that no one else can answer, and that's probably going to be what we continue to focus on doing first.","476":"We've made significant changes in how we've allocated our own organic dollars, both in R&D as well as in sales and marketing.","477":"So while other revenue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that.","478":"because right now most assistants are fairly dumb in terms of just doing one-turn dialogue, but where we're going to go is multi-turn dialogue and that requires real natural language understanding.","479":"The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods.","480":"They then used Nielsen Brand Effects and were able to measure a 16-point lift in ad recall and a 5-point lift in intent to visit Subway.","481":"And we have really wanted to support the publishers.","482":"But we've also been innovating over the past several years.","483":"We launched, for example, Teams for first-line workers, which had things like shift worker capabilities, secure messaging.","484":"So that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you see in margin year-over-year.","485":"As people spend more time with News Feed, we get better about understanding what they like and getting the content that they care about in front of them.","486":"So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories.","487":"So, as Phil mentioned, we are seeing continued increases in usage, both sequentially and year-over-year.","488":"And more interestingly the mix of all of them because the enterprise is heterogeneous.","489":"What we are talking about is the fulfillment center \u2013 additional fulfillment center costs that we see this time every year as we get ready for Q4 but also additional step-up in content spend, where we spend a lot of our content in Q3.","490":"They were the first part of the community to get access to these new features.","491":"What happens on our platform is often that people will start out during demand generation and then use the repeat opportunity to show people ads, moving down the funnel to demand fulfillment.","492":"because for too long our industry has been focused on proxy metrics, how long someone viewed a video, even brand lift, measurements we care about, but these are all proxy metrics.","493":"It's an enormous sized market and whether it grows, from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge.","494":"It's very early in our rollout, but nothing inconsistent with what we've been modeling.","495":"Are we executing well on it?","496":"because really, this is the quarter when you've been able to see actually in Q2 and Q3 now us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our Intelligent Cloud and the opportunity we see there across engineering, sales and marketing.","497":"It includes things like the Community Operations investments that we talked about today in the announcement.","498":"And also we just, we created a new category of 2-in-1s where even our OEMs are finding success, which was one of our strategic objectives of doing the Surface.","499":"The majority of potential signal loss on targeting is still in front of us.","500":"So at a high-level you can either sort of add more, expand your footprint or you get to add a new customer and both of those are motions that we focus on and I feel good about our execution.","501":"But I just think that the area that it's currently operating within, it's hard to tell the difference of the consumer level for us.","502":"About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3.","503":"And you're absolutely seeing the impact of that growth as mix show up in the gross margin.","504":"So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year.","505":"And of course, Apple is the only company that could have brought this because it requires both hardware and software integration, and it requires sort of making a lot of \u2013 or giving the operating system update to many people at once.","506":"So I'm not going to say a stat, but it's grown a lot .","507":"And they used Audience Insights, targeting people ages 18 to 49 who purchase meat and cheese, and that's just pretty incredible targeting.","508":"On the first one, on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services.","509":"And then lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers.","510":"And so we're working toward those things.","511":"I think we felt very good, those as well, I think we\u2019re pretty broad-based across industry.","512":"So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.","513":"I view that as strategic relevance long term inside of digital accounts.","514":"I think one of the things that's interesting about Instagram is while the ads are really visually appealing and that brings to mind certain verticals like fashion or autos, things where the visual really matters, what we're seeing is that lots of different verticals can use the platform really well.","515":"The only thing I'll add is when I look at the total growth of Azure, the growth that's coming now from some of the premium services, these are businesses that we actually did not ever participate on premise at all.","516":"So to me, those high-level services will over time attach in Azure, but also in Dynamics as well as in Office 365.","517":"So we're pretty early in this whole thing and there's so much unique content that people share in Facebook that I think that that is the clear, unique opportunity to go for first, right?","518":"And that's -- everything is already very tightly integrated kind of below the surface, in a way that people using these apps may not feel.","519":"So we made a number of changes and are still making changes to prioritize meaningful interactions between people over passive consumption of content.","520":"Yeah, I'm going to be vague on the scale of it, but their capital intensity is offset by their density and throughput.","521":"On fashion, yeah, fashion and apparel continue to be a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excited about.","522":"And so I think our year-over-year improvement as well as sequential improvement and our ability in the overall commercial business, you see the gross margins we did has the mix shift to the cloud, I think we\u2019re all quite proud of.","523":"And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans.","524":"And we expect that to be -- it started to be a little more balanced cost globally as we move into 2020.","525":"So, Peter, just on the \u2013 on ads engagement, that's an area that we've obviously been very focused on, and we're really pleased with the results that we're seeing there in terms of driving better engagement per ad, and that's really the focus of a lot of our quality and relevance efforts.","526":"I think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand awareness, discovery and eventually purchase.","527":"We will do that overtime","528":"And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving.","529":"So I think what we're going to end up seeing is building out Payments, which is going to end up being something that we do country-by-country \u2013 we have a test that is running in India for WhatsApp now, we're hoping to launch in several other countries at some point, but I don't want to put a timeframe on that here, but it's something that we're actively working on.","530":"So again, we're very excited, number of different things we're working on, but certainly one of the drivers along with all of the things that I mentioned is certainly FBA is very helpful.","531":"We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience and we think they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon.","532":"I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively under in check the last two years in the infrastructure area.","533":"Now, in terms of having support for these different runtimes, you're absolutely right, that's the reason why for example on Azure itself Java is first class.","534":"Overall, in terms of the workload mix, it\u2019s been fairly stable, which is our hybrid value proposition really has continued to resonate.","535":"And so we'll expect to see more of that flow through over time.","536":"So I think that is kind of playing out as we expected.","537":"You\u2019re seeing leverage through the P&L and we\u2019ll see a moderating rate in FY\u201919 even if Q1 is the big quarter.","538":"But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I'll say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers","539":"We're going to have great flagship phones for Windows 10.","540":"We're very happy with all the customers we have but particularly the Prime customers that we have.","541":"And the idea there is that people want to interact in lots of different ways.","542":"A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business.","543":"On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials.","544":"Thanks for the question.","545":"And so we do put a lot of weight behind that.","546":"I will point out that we have continued to lower prices.","547":"And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether, frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS.","548":"Video content is with the new global program, global Prime Video is becoming more global with the launch in India as well.","549":"So in Q1 of this year, subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.","550":"And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth.","551":"And we also see small businesses.","552":"So we're investing a lot in this opportunity and we're confident it will pay off in the long run.","553":"But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers.","554":"As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter.","555":"So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year, so we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well.","556":"I think the smartphone market is sort of like the best market for a consumer product company in the history of the world and \u2013 but that's how I feel about it.","557":"So, you\u2019re certainly seeing that impacted.","558":"But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in.","559":"On the growth in MAUs in rest of world, we've had certain slowdowns.","560":"So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S.","561":"They hold us accountable for making their experience quick, and we want to do everything we can to do that.","562":"And we think that there's a lot more connecting in community that people want there.","563":"And so the nut of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off.","564":"So you're going to see this continually from us.","565":"When we look into 2019, we do expect to see a deceleration of revenue growth throughout the year.","566":"I do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really starts to click here, right?","567":"So all these things are making the program better and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible.","568":"And generally what we find is that price is important.","569":"We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way, if that's how they choose.","570":"We're pretty encouraged by what we've seen even though it's pretty early days.","571":"We continue to see that.","572":"So we think that's all foundational.","573":"Just a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center world right now and our transport networks.","574":"So yes, and we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to, versus licensing many times by country, the third-party rights to content that we don't create ourselves.","575":"But I don't think that there is really a strategy to pull this in from 10 years to five, I just think it's going to be a 10-year thing.","576":"But as I think about \u2013 I tend to focus as you know on the all-up server and product KPI","577":"So, Stories is obviously one of the big growing areas for us and continues to be a big driver.","578":"I mean we have -- we are pleased with the engagement that we're seeing on the Facebook app broadly.","579":"But we're looking \u2013 we think there is still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime.","580":"Digital technology today is not about tech companies doing innovation.","581":"So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefits it's delivering.","582":"I don't think we have any specific stats to share on this, but it's going well.","583":"As we look back on that, there were number of factors.","584":"E5 continues to see encouraging signs.","585":"So, there's a lot of different influences there.","586":"And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, so whether that's businesses, public figures like athletes and celebrities and types of folks that people want to interact with on these different platforms, and we did that on Facebook in News Feed group pages, and we're working on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger.","587":"It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it.","588":"So I think it strikes me as very likely that the next one is going to be around virtual and augmented reality.","589":"So I think geographically we are seeing very, very good performance.","590":"You're also right that we are very focused on commerce ads on Facebook, that the great, great, great majority of activity is commerce ads on Facebook.","591":"And so Pages are a good and free and easy way to have a mobile presence, and that's something we're very focused on growing.","592":"And so people now are spending more time on the Store, they download more apps, and that over time translates into monetization.","593":"But overall, I believe this hyperscale plus hybrid architecturally helps us a lot with enterprise customers","594":"As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone and that's a combination of single digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X.","595":"And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads.","596":"So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves.","597":"Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts.","598":"But I think over the very long term, which is how you framed your question, we have a lot of opportunity.","599":"We saw a strong double-digit growth in premium.","600":"And then in addition, we're continuing to focus our product development around putting privacy first and that's going to, we believe, have some impact on revenue growth.","601":"We've had really great productive discussions with the Indian government, and I fully expect that at some point, they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country.","602":"If we're delivering on those three elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third-party.","603":"So that's, if you wanted to break it down into two more sustaining things, those are the types of things we're seeing in that number.","604":"And we're pretty excited about what that shows in terms of how video can be used in a really broad-based way but also a more personal way.","605":"And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number","606":"I mean, my own take of this, I think this has gone pretty well and has done what we had hoped, although we've made a number of changes.","607":"So that's really the main focus.","608":"We've done such a terrific job, I think, of growing and focusing and the innovation we put in and having our sales teams, through investments we've made for the past couple of years, and competency building, land that at customers.","609":"And finally, just the strong work on the infrastructure team, both between hardware innovation done at everything from the network, all the way to the prox and their integration with each other as well as the software innovation being done on top of it.","610":"Whether it's first-party games or third-party games, we are best-in-class in that monetization and that's what's reflected in the results.","611":"And so I think the use cases on this much like our phones will be broad based.","612":"Based on that experience, we're now planning to expand our channel before the holiday season.","613":"So, we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this.","614":"And what we're doing on Messenger and on WhatsApp are really making sure that businesses can connect with people, and then in the early stages of testing messaging.","615":"When I talk about the premium services mix, in our Office Commercial 365 business being about 60%, that is what's driving whether that's the mix shift to E3 or ultimately to E5 you will continue to see and have headroom in that number but you are right, we are encouraged by the ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose those premium SKUs over time.","616":"So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing is increasing, what I would call, annuity relationships and subscription relationships with all classes of customers.","617":"I feel very good about that.","618":"Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them all well.","619":"And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us.","620":"In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they are on upgrade plans and so forth.","621":"So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi-billion dollar business for us.","622":"So we're very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming.","623":"So it's multiple services.","624":"Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter.","625":"But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver and I feel that we did that.","626":"In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern.","627":"We continue to be pleased with the growth of Instagram both on a user basis and on a revenue basis.","628":"Yes, I think in terms of our core advertising products and growth, it's worth really remembering that our core feed products for Facebook and Instagram are growing nicely and well.","629":"So I'd expect we would continue to make changes and evolve.","630":"So, we feel very good about that and we feel that we have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone.","631":"And so I see the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand and for people that really want the best products.","632":"So we think of the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows, but also people will use phones of iOS and Android, but they need both productivity, creativity, and security across all of this estate of theirs, and that\u2019s where I think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition.","633":"And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out.","634":"So having mid-roll ads, we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user experience, but that is going to enable the kind of content that I think is going to take us to the next level.","635":"I think we're going to get to where we need to get to there.","636":"So on Search, we already have one very big use case which is people basically using our search engine to look out pages and people who are on Facebook and that by itself is already one of the biggest search engines in the world.","637":"I think that this is going to become increasingly important not just from the perspective of what does the privacy policy say but how is this deeply designed into the products that we're building.","638":"Overall these areas around commerce and payments, I think are one of the most exciting areas of product development for the next several years.","639":"So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth.","640":"And so we're bringing all of our energies to bear there.","641":"So we see a role for all carriers, in fact including the delivery service partner program that we\u2019ve developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well.","642":"Advertising is going to be the way that the revenue comes in for the foreseeable future, but what we expect is as we build out more commerce-related features around shopping, and Instagram and Marketplace and Facebook and certainly, the private social platform that we\u2019re \u2013 that I\u2019ve been talking about I think will lend itself to private interactions around payments and commerce and interacting with businesses in that way, I think what we\u2019re going this is we\u2019re going to build more tools for people to buy things directly through the platform.","643":"and we continue to build our products to serve a wide variety of audiences, including Millennials as well.","644":"So for the first time now, we have the ability to go to an enterprise and talk about their entire data estate across Windows and Linux.","645":"The value that we care about here is helping to build common ground.","646":"So yeah, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers for sure, authors, as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers.","647":"today we use some basic signals like who you're friends with and what pages you like as some of the most important things for figuring out what \u2013 out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show and what are going to be the most interesting things to you.","648":"This growth rate is going to bounce around.","649":"We did see ARPU growth this quarter.","650":"It all comes down to customer choice.","651":"So a lot of what we've been trying to do is make it so that we build out the infrastructure, so that way WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram direct can evolve rather than being just places where you message folks.","652":"I think what\u2019s exciting about those platforms is that they combine the art and the science of both a creative canvas that marketers are excited about and targeting.","653":"From a revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there.","654":"So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas.","655":"And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership save incremental dollars, because of it at Whole Foods.","656":"I would characterize the launch of Status apps on WhatsApp as being a much smaller thing than a driver of 2019 revenue growth, and it's going to be more about Instagram and Facebook.","657":"In terms of the timing, this is really early.","658":"Video ads are important on our platform and the most important thing that\u2019s growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing.","659":"I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those.","660":"And the other one is the on-premises server number which is very good in terms of hybrid demand this quarter also with high margin.","661":"In the United States, which is usually the most advanced market, 35% of small businesses have no web presence at all.","662":"And now, I think we're starting to work through what the formula is going to be so we can take some of those rate limits off and let video grow at the rate it wants to.","663":"So this is about getting projects started, making those projects successful, making sure customers feel the value and get the value of their investment.","664":"So we're comping that.","665":"So, it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it.","666":"It\u2019s not the only market that we are working on obviously.","667":"And so, as of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started.","668":"But it doesn't stop in Azure.","669":"And so between all of those hardware products, as well as our gaming performance, another sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches.","670":"So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us.","671":"And on the testimony, these are important issues and I think that that was an important moment to be able to go and hear what people were wondering about and just to have a public hearing of answering all of the questions around Cambridge Analytica and what we knew and all the steps that we're taking on data privacy and developers to make sure that this doesn't happen again and to lay out all the different things that we're doing.","672":"We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering.","673":"So I think what you're going to start to see are people interacting with pages, maybe follow a page on Facebook or Instagram.","674":"On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business.","675":"But generally what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic.","676":"We have stated that we want to double the size of the services business from the level that we had in fiscal 2016 by 2020.","677":"The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall.","678":"So one area where I'm very proud that we're doing great work is around identifying terrorist content.","679":"So there's no single factor, but those are all contributing factors in terms of MAU growth.","680":"But its\u2019 going well and I think we plan to roll it out every where pretty soon, so that\u2019s the game plan there.","681":"And so having control later in the process is very valuable to us especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network.","682":"And the biggest thing that I think we can take away from this as we invest in augmented reality in addition to virtual reality, is that the phone is probably going to be the mainstream consumer platform that a lot of these AR features first become mainstream rather than glasses form factor that people will wear on their face.","683":"So in our commercial business, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of continuing to outpace IT spend on an overall basis by continuing to push customers to our annuity business whether they are on -- on premise or the cloud.","684":"So that's one place where as you know, any AI project first starts with data, and that's one place where we are seeing good traction.","685":"Also, from the currency point of view and the weak global economies, we don\u2019t overly focus on this.","686":"So we are putting more compute behind that.","687":"Obviously, third party sellers are an important part of our value proposition there.","688":"It just we are now shipping more and more of our, other demand out of our warehouses, because of the strength in retail and FBA.","689":"So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there.","690":"And our ability to do that is why we're investing in the Audience Network.","691":"we feel slightly very good about where we are right now in the cycle.","692":"But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.","693":"And then we're continuing to invest heavily in our innovation investments.","694":"So between both of those and the first time buyers as well, it seems really, really good right now.","695":"So that is great.","696":"So I would say, yes, we had -- as we've mentioned the last couple of calls, we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity.","697":"And the best way we've done that is by simplified ad products.","698":"But overall, I mean the reason why we\u2019re interested in this as the social company is that we think that this is going to be a new way that people interact.","699":"So, attractive investments we believe, but ones that will take longer-term to pay off, and those would have a dilutive effect on margins in the near-term.","700":"I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related.","701":"And so I think, we'll keep investing in those areas.","702":"So the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone.","703":"I would say the overall change that we are going through, and this has been ongoing for I would say the last multiple years, is transforming our field engagement model, where we're putting a lot more technical depth in the front-line sellers so that they can engage, whether it's data specialists, cloud specialists, security specialists, or even productivity specialists.","704":"So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.","705":"And so I\u2019m really happy where we are currently, and happy enough that we\u2019re looking forward to expanding into more countries in late June.","706":"So it's a bit of an investment that has implications for a lot of elements to your cost structure, but we're very happy with Kiva.","707":"So I think it's the combination of all of that.","708":"As we always do when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within.","709":"But I think we're doing good work there now and it's growing quite quickly.","710":"But the more we can do it, even in studies with each client, the better our ads get.","711":"And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low, I mean in some cases, it's zero, that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world, that will buy smartphones and we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.","712":"And so there's no doubt about that.","713":"But we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season.","714":"So I would not characterize it as a cycle.","715":"There are things that remain relatively similar as we launch new products.","716":"We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions.","717":"We try to make it very easy for businesses to promote pages, promote posts and the like.","718":"For the smaller portion of our business it\u2019s still non-annuity per transactional, it does provide as I talked about earlier some opportunity but it\u2019s not that large just because the nature of the commitment our customers now is far more of the annuity type.","719":"And I think a lot of the success that we've seen has been because of some of the work that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News Feed and I mean that team has executed really well.","720":"So the pricing is really about what is the pricing that you're seeing in the overall system primarily driven on the Feed-based products.","721":"So on AI, I think that there's a very big shift in how we're going to think about content moderation on the platform.","722":"I do think the upgrade market will look at larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to -- how often and so forth.","723":"Whether it's frankly our views on gaming that Satya just discussed, I feel like the signal we're hearing is that we're in the right part of the market with customer-focused value that can deliver a high ROI to them, no matter what that IT budget looks like.","724":"However, that said, I think AR can be huge.","725":"So we're still very full in our fulfillment centers.","726":"At least that's what we're seeing in North America.","727":"And so we've worked hard to build measurement tools into the products, so that when you buy an ad, an SMB has a very easy interface and decide what their goals are.","728":"That once they understand what's really moving their product off shelves, online and off, that's where we get to the real work we need to do to optimize the ad and really work on the targeting.","729":"So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh and we've now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year.","730":"The team has actually done nice job in that segment, created some really modern offers, to get back and to enhance market that as well.","731":"We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops.","732":"But in our case there are two unique aspects.","733":"In the more temporal bucket this quarter as well as last you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature.","734":"And so we\u2019re really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country.","735":"So Reactions is going to rollout on every platform.","736":"So we're excited about what we're building there.","737":"And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising.","738":"So, that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base.","739":"And so, if we start to focus on one number or the other, I think we're missing the fact that our customer method and go-to-market is actually through the overall product portfolio.","740":"So our success in building - continuing to build good advertising products for our e-commerce clients on the advertising side will be a more important contributor to revenue in the foreseeable future than the new area.","741":"On the business side, I think we have both pleased with the results.","742":"That is a new experience that we're building, and building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it, and we'll see where that goes over time.","743":"That doesn't say that there is not a nice market for a home one.","744":"We usually will expand our content, expanding our device and usage.","745":"So that's obviously what we're looking for when we look forward.","746":"We feel very good about the long term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers.","747":"As I said earlier this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment and so hopefully that can turn into a positive for us.","748":"The last thing I'll say is that I think these things are more connected than people realize, in the sense that we're already seeing some nice traction with click-to-Messenger ads.","749":"And so overall, we do think that this tablet that can replace your laptop is ideally suited for productivity needs, which means it's great for your personal use as well as your use inside of the enterprise, and we continue to see good growth.","750":"But our focus is really on ensuring that we\u2019ve got capacity from available resources, whether it\u2019s our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure we\u2019re able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.","751":"And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces.","752":"First, we're continuing to add our AWS sales and marketing teams.","753":"No plans to bring that in-house.","754":"So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month, and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month, Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with.","755":"The opportunity I believe in both cases is high, and we are confident that our teams are well-positioned to capitalize on it.","756":"The team did a great job of getting into supply demand balance there in December.","757":"So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business.","758":"Yeah, it was an incredible quarter.","759":"And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.","760":"In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true, that the upgrade cycle is longer.","761":"The one additional thing I\u2019d mention, which is increasingly becoming clearer to us is operational sovereignty will become important, the world and its distributed computing needs is not going to become some margin as set of requirements but it's going to be very heterogeneous, very in many cases regulated and so what we provide in terms of both the technology and the business model I think shows up with the maximum flexibility.","762":"So when you can both add to your install base and add overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business for our long-term goals.","763":"We're focusing more on shorter-form content to start.","764":"So I think the fact that we've already gotten 2 million advertisers to move into Stories is because we've gotten better at making it easier.","765":"The second factor is just anticipated changes that mobile platforms will make that will make targeting and measurement more difficult.","766":"So just on the question of how Oculus would affect the cost structure, it's premature for us to be giving guidance on the cost structure in 2016.","767":"The Windows 10 commercial component will look far more like our success and our motion and overall being able to sell the Microsoft 360 value prop.","768":"See, our overall vision for how computing evolves is that it's going to be more distributed, not less distributed.","769":"In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth.","770":"So sort of everywhere I look I see significant opportunity.","771":"Now, at the same time, in order to make this experience good, there also needs to be good content in the system, right, so we need to make sure that people have the tools to able to share the moments that they care about.","772":"And so that's what, that and our new products give us great confidence headed into this holiday season that this is going to be the best holiday season yet.","773":"So I would say, we do plan to continue to invest aggressively in the business going forward, and we are going to see, obviously, a margin impact from that in 2019.","774":"And so there will be volatility in this number, but the consistent theme of being double-digit billings that really match our strength in Office 365, I think -- and I do expect to continue.","775":"And, Walter, I think the way you see that show up is really in my conversation on FY 2019, to Satya's point, really we talked about that server product and KPI being high teens through FY 2019.","776":"And so I do think it will be a blend of those.","777":"If you think about our history, people made the shift to mobile before marketers did, and I think one of the successes we've had is we made it easier for advertisers to move into a mobile environment.","778":"I think we've made real improvements there, but I think there's a lot more we can do.","779":"So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.","780":"So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering.","781":"Over the last few years, we focused a lot on a number of major social issues everything from preventing election interference to reducing harmful content to protecting privacy.","782":"But we're going to need definitely continued support of our external transportation partners.","783":"We were very encouraged by the results this quarter.","784":"We do it with you know a combination of price and capability that we think is unmatched.","785":"And in fact, if anything, this release of Windows 10, just the way we have built it with the Insider program, everything is of course speeding up","786":"And so, the ecosystem there is very, very strong.","787":"So even with significant improvement again in, what Satya was talking about, some of the lower level IaaS and PaaS services within Azure, on the gross margin side you'll see some gross margin percentage pressure in that segment through 2019, but with significant dollar growth.","788":"With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact at a couple points either way, but I don't think about that as really immaterial impact.","789":"The main focus is on helping people capture and share any moment that they want, and also the whole theme that we have around community plays out a little bit differently on Instagram.","790":"So Messenger-only usage is not having a material impact on our overall usage stats.","791":"On that second point, in terms of how we think about the capacity we might have for our own, I think you know \u2013 I\u2019d start with, you know we\u2019ve got a great relationship with third party carriers across the countries where we operate.","792":"This is always going to be a lumpy business.","793":"So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy.","794":"So, when you think about segments the majority of these relate to the AWS segment.","795":"Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out.","796":"But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime.","797":"On the OEM side, the way to think about those comments is we do expect inventory levels to likely remain low as we exit the next quarter as well.","798":"We continue to believe we're delivering great ROI for advertisers.","799":"So I think less about it being cannibalistic","800":"and so it's is an area that we're focused on.","801":"So, I actually feel very good, but as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory that you are not seeing frankly much impact on the gross margin line and we are seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line.","802":"It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA program.","803":"So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp still stays about consistent as it was.","804":"So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products.","805":"In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know, but we do continue to see strong growth in both feed and stories ads on the platform.","806":"On the other side, AppleCare, I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June, so really strong performance, but our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected, because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers.","807":"And the best articulation of this that I can make is that today, AI has different strengths than people do.","808":"The Azure pace is not, if you drew a line, as correlated to EAs as it even was 3 years ago, as we've I think matured the product and matured our sales cycles.","809":"We feel good about this lift-shift modernize motions that are happening.","810":"so it\u2019s really its entirety that we think of as our unique value","811":"And as we are more effective at getting direct response into Stories, that should improve, so some opportunity there.","812":"In terms of the ASP, the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price and so we don't want to charge more than that, and we think it's worth being fair.","813":"Yeah, we are seeing - as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing a good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally.","814":"We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market.","815":"As we look out into 2019 further, that's - the macro economy is certainly a potential headwind and risk to the business just given the sensitivity of the advertising business to a slowdown in growth.","816":"And then in terms of payments, there's multiple approaches that we're taking there.","817":"But right now, we're developing them somewhat independently.","818":"So there'll be more pricing pressure there","819":"We're pleased with the growth in time spent per DAU that we're seeing across the Facebook family of apps.","820":"On Ad Breaks for mid-roll video, early days pretty good result, and we'll continue to test the user experience and advertiser demand.","821":"And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work.","822":"On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth.","823":"So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here.","824":"We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware.","825":"We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth in engagement.","826":"So we think that will purge (40:38) some other demographic groups as well.","827":"In terms of regulation overall, I think that, that's going to be very important.","828":"And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things.","829":"So that is going to be the offset, and I mentioned particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment which is a headwind at this point.","830":"And the software team worked really hard to make that go back several versions of iPhone so that we sort of have hundreds of millions of enabled devices overnight.","831":"The video strategy is -- has been pretty consistent.","832":"And that product I think is a pretty revolutionary product","833":"I think we're just finally getting into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing and it's good to sort of see those in last quarter's results as well.","834":"So what we're seeing from DPA ads and carousel ads, we're really happy with.","835":"Obviously, those results would have been higher without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier.","836":"Our growth was really strong across all of our marketer segments, but we had a particularly good quarter in brands, I think driven by two things.","837":"And I would guess that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle.","838":"And so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward.","839":"So that\u2019s contributing to some of the deceleration, specifically as we look out into the remainder of 2019.","840":"On head count, I would just point out that our payroll growth tends to lag head count growth, because head count is an end-of-period number, so the acceleration that we're seeing in 2017 will obviously play out in 2018 as well.","841":"So that's what we've designed it for.","842":"As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen.","843":"But we feel fantastic, particularly as it pertains to iPhone X.","844":"So there is a lot of investment going on and there will be continued, especially related to Prime.","845":"Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales.","846":"The second component is what I would put in a bucket of new business.","847":"So it would be early to be talking about large shipment volumes.","848":"As you said, I mean at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially.","849":"Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold.","850":"And then of course, we are very excited about E5, but they're very, very early days of E5.","851":"This has been happening over multiple years, but we have now got very good customer momentum","852":"So I would say that I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that that was great work with a - on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built previously.","853":"And then our Cosmos DB has become the leading multi-model, multi-region database.","854":"So we're really pleased with what we're doing on the revenue front.","855":"So it's gone very well.","856":"And so, the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first line.","857":"As there are more Stories and feed, as more people are engaged in Facebook and increasingly in Instagram, that gives us more opportunities just on the supply side of ads.","858":"And so, that's how I measure progress.","859":"And as I'd indicated before, the China rebound was broad based across the products.","860":"but the focus is really to build a rev-share model over time that's sustainable.","861":"The first thing is we're seeing longer commitments.","862":"To your second question on Office -- I'm sorry, on Windows Commercial overall, our real investment -- and you're right, we are starting to reach some tougher comparables.","863":"So that should be well received by the Indian consumer base.","864":"But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 bps.","865":"So all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year.","866":"Yes, a couple things Brad.","867":"I think AR is big and profound and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it.","868":"And a lot of, I think, what we need to do is give people a way to see all of the videos that page that they like or follow is interested in sharing on Facebook.","869":"So, we\u2019re seeing strong growth across those platforms.","870":"And over the long-term, I think one of the big things that we need to do is see if we can not only make this good for engagement for our partners, but also a really positive business driver for them too.","871":"And those in addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion had been extremely well received.","872":"We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.","873":"And the answer is, it\u2019s a little bigger, but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year.","874":"So that's how we look at.","875":"And so, we plan on going in there with sort of all of our might.","876":"And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that \u2013 I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.","877":"The challenge is always going to be cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time.","878":"So that's clearly going to stay.","879":"So it's a number of factors, I would say.","880":"It has been remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets.","881":"And so that's been really a great story for us.","882":"And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution, not just on renewals in quarter, but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we\u2019ve seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed, because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction.","883":"And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain.","884":"If anything, all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly revenue driving growth.","885":"So, a combination of being able to understand the text that people message, read the articles that people would want to look at, watch the videos, look at the photos, are going to be great, too.","886":"And we still believe that over time every phone sold will be a smartphone.","887":"And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that.","888":"So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently.","889":"It's a very computationally and resource-intensive set of services that we provide and we need to build that out.","890":"Instagram has more heavy usage of Stories, so that's an area of continued growth opportunity because the effective levels of monetization in Stories are lower.","891":"So I would say the Prime membership to Prime flywheel, the additional benefits we are adding to Prime, not only in North America but also Internationally, and additional selection both retail and FBA which feeds the Prime flywheel.","892":"But our approach frankly is not changing over time.","893":"We are putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program.","894":"On Millennials, we were really pleased","895":"And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.","896":"But the core of our focus is still very much focused on ads and how we can do ads at the product level.","897":"On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line.","898":"In terms of larger developers, if you step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are two key constituencies in that equation.","899":"We also are incredibly happy to see the highest Android switcher rate that we've observed.","900":"Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers.","901":"Yes, we're very excited about the partnership with Adobe.","902":"So I would say that is a continuation of last year.","903":"And the advantage of that is also that some of those can be single player experiences.","904":"And so our task is to convince people that currently \u2013 or have another type of phone to switch, while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose \u2013 when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone.","905":"So we're seeing a lot of strength.","906":"Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa.","907":"So we're very ready to go.","908":"So we think about this part more holistically, and same thing with Dynamics.","909":"And we agree that we are underpenetrated there.","910":"And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers.","911":"As you've seen, we guided up sequentially in revenue.","912":"It's true in North America and our more developed markets within Europe, but I wouldn't say there's any real surprises there.","913":"We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year.","914":"So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1.","915":"And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe with looking at the results.","916":"I think this is going to be an exciting year.","917":"At the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling.","918":"So even going forward, there's going be revenue share back to the content creator, so it's going have a different margin structure than the core business.","919":"And so I think we\u2019ll be able to show the progress we\u2019ve made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward.","920":"So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting that segment.","921":"You know one of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands.","922":"And so what that shows is our growth is being driven by the ability of us to do this broad-based consumer media advertising but do it in a more targeted way.","923":"And then CapEx, we'll see continue to flow in through the P&L over time.","924":"And so we think that certainly we want to provide the best advertising, we certainly want to provide the best measurement, but our ability to do so as long as things happen across the industry, which is what's happening, I think we remain in a very strong position.","925":"And for that reason, we think mid-roll is a better user experience.","926":"So we would expect expense growth to ramp throughout the year, largely due to the factors that we've talked about on prior calls in terms of what's driving the overall acceleration.","927":"So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points.","928":"Watch and AirPods are doing incredibly well.","929":"The geos I specifically called out obviously were we're the most impacted and they're the bigger geos.","930":"So you will see more going forward.","931":"And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that activity that people want to do organically.","932":"In the last 18 months, we've doubled the number of paid Prime member, which we're very excited about.","933":"Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing.","934":"I think it's possible to get to the point in the next five to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things.","935":"We're very happy with that.","936":"Even this quarter is a great example.","937":"but we believe there are going to be opportunities as we further scale those properties.","938":"So I think that's going to constantly be a thing that plays into the desktop revenue.","939":"So let's start with the $239 million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we partnered with.","940":"So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we want to invest in over the next year and doing our long-range planning, and this is certainly one of the areas where I think we want to be investing a lot more in and believe that there's a big opportunity and can accelerate all the effort.","941":"Along with that, goes the advertising opportunities.","942":"Then, on top of it, we even have modernization of apps that is accelerating.","943":"And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers.","944":"And addition to the workloads Satya mentioned, I'll also bring up EMF.","945":"We do a very good job in terms of supply chain and being able to -- be able to get those up and running quite quickly.","946":"In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where we\u2019re outside of it, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a large step function increase.","947":"I mean, we obviously are focused on hiring top engineering talent.","948":"The team is doing a terrific job in terms of working on behalf of customers to pass on savings as they see it.","949":"I expect that actually to continue in Q2.","950":"I mean, these are really privacy-first products, and I think that, that's kind of the most important way that we're thinking about this whole space overall.","951":"And I think you're going to be able to look at these transparency reports as we issue them and see that we're continually making more progress, finding more of the content proactively, taking - getting better at taking it down, getting better at not distributing stuff that's borderline.","952":"We're encouraged by the improvements we've seen year over year.","953":"And
