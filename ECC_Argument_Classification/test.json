Q2 and Q3 now us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our Intelligent Cloud and the opportunity we see there across engineering, sales and marketing.", 0], ["It includes things like the Community Operations investments that we talked about today in the announcement.", 0], ["And also we just, we created a new category of 2-in-1s where even our OEMs are finding success, which was one of our strategic objectives of doing the Surface.", 0], ["The majority of potential signal loss on targeting is still in front of us.", 0], ["So at a high-level you can either sort of add more, expand your footprint or you get to add a new customer and both of those are motions that we focus on and I feel good about our execution.", 0], ["But I just think that the area that it's currently operating within, it's hard to tell the difference of the consumer level for us.", 0], ["About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3.", 0], ["And you're absolutely seeing the impact of that growth as mix show up in the gross margin.", 0], ["So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year.", 0], ["And of course, Apple is the only company that could have brought this because it requires both hardware and software integration, and it requires sort of making a lot of \u2013 or giving the operating system update to many people at once.", 0], ["So I'm not going to say a stat, but it's grown a lot", 0], ["And they used Audience Insights, targeting people ages 18 to 49 who purchase meat and cheese, and that's just pretty incredible targeting.", 0], ["On the first one, on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services.", 1], ["And then lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers.", 1], ["And so we're working toward those things.", 1], ["I think we felt very good, those as well, I think we\u2019re pretty broad-based across industry.", 1], ["So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.", 1], ["I view that as strategic relevance long term inside of digital accounts.", 1], ["I think one of the things that's interesting about Instagram is while the ads are really visually appealing and that brings to mind certain verticals like fashion or autos, things where the visual really matters, what we're seeing is that lots of different verticals can use the platform really well.", 1], ["The only thing I'll add is when I look at the total growth of Azure, the growth that's coming now from some of the premium services, these are businesses that we actually did not ever participate on premise at all.", 1], ["So to me, those high-level services will over time attach in Azure, but also in Dynamics as well as in Office 365.", 1], ["So we're pretty early in this whole thing and there's so much unique content that people share in Facebook that I think that that is the clear, unique opportunity to go for first, right?", 1], ["And that's -- everything is already very tightly integrated kind of below the surface, in a way that people using these apps may not feel.", 1], ["So we made a number of changes and are still making changes to prioritize meaningful interactions between people over passive consumption of content.", 1], ["Yeah, I'm going to be vague on the scale of it, but their capital intensity is offset by their density and throughput.", 1], ["On fashion, yeah, fashion and apparel continue to be a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excited about.", 1], ["And so I think our year-over-year improvement as well as sequential improvement and our ability in the overall commercial business, you see the gross margins we did has the mix shift to the cloud, I think we\u2019re all quite proud of.", 1], ["And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans.", 1], ["And we expect that to be -- it started to be a little more balanced cost

seeing there in terms of driving better engagement per ad, and that's really the focus of a lot of our quality and relevance efforts.", 1], ["I think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand awareness, discovery and eventually purchase.", 1], ["We will do that overtime,", 1], ["And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving.", 1], ["So I think what we're going to end up seeing is building out Payments, which is going to end up being something that we do

but it's something that we're actively working on.", 1], ["So again, we're very excited, number of different things we're working on, but certainly one of the drivers along with all of the things that I mentioned is certainly FBA is very helpful.", 1], ["We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience and we think they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon.", 1], ["I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively under in check the last two years in the infrastructure area.", 1], ["Now, in terms of having support for these different runtimes, you're absolutely right, that's the reason why for example on Azure itself Java is first class.", 1], ["Overall, in terms of the workload mix, it\u2019s been fairly stable, which is our hybrid value proposition really has continued to resonate.", 1], ["And so we'll expect to see more of that flow through over time.", 1], ["So I think that is kind of playing out as we expected.", 1], ["You\u2019re seeing leverage through the P&L and we\u2019ll see a moderating rate in FY\u201919 even

the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials.", 1], ["Thanks for the question.", 1], ["And so we do put a lot of weight behind that.", 1], ["I will point out that we have continued to lower prices.", 1], ["And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether, frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS.", 1], ["Video content is with the new global program, global Prime Video is becoming more global with the launch in India as well.", 1], ["So in Q1 of this year, subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.", 1], ["And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth.", 1], ["And we also see small businesses.", 1], ["So we're investing a lot in this", 1], ["But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers.", 1], ["As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter.", 1], ["So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year, so we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well.",

certainly seeing that impacted.", 1], ["But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in.", 1], ["On the growth in MAUs in rest of world, we've had certain slowdowns.", 1], ["So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S.", 1], ["They hold us accountable for making their experience quick, and we want to do everything we can to do that.", 1], ["And we think that there's a lot more connecting in community that people want there.", 1], ["And so the nut of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off.", 1], ["So you're going to see this continually from us.", 1], ["When we look into 2019, we do expect to see a deceleration of revenue growth throughout the year.", 1], ["I do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really starts to click here, right?", 1], ["So all these things are making the program better and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible.", 1], ["And generally what we find is that price is important.", 1], ["We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way, if that's how they choose.", 1], ["We're pretty encouraged by what we've seen even though it's pretty early days.", 1], ["We continue to see that.", 1], ["So we think that's all foundational.", 1], ["Just a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center world right now and our transport networks.", 1], ["So yes, and we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to, versus licensing many times by country, the third-party rights to content that we don't create ourselves.", 1], ["But I don't think that there is really a strategy to pull this in from 10 years to five, I just think it's going to be a 10-year thing.", 1], ["But as I think about \u2013 I tend to focus as you know on the all-up server and product KPI", 1], ["So, Stories is obviously one of the big growing areas for us and continues to be a big driver.", 1], ["I mean we have -- we are pleased with the engagement that we're seeing on the Facebook app broadly.", 1], ["But we're looking \u2013 we think there is still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime.", 1], ["Digital technology today is not about tech companies doing innovation.", 1], ["So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefits it's delivering.", 1], ["I don't think we have any specific stats to share on this, but it's going well.", 1], ["As we look back on that, there were number of factors.", 1], ["E5 continues to see encouraging signs.", 1], ["So, there's a lot of different influences there.", 1], ["And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, so whether that's businesses, public figures like athletes and celebrities and types

Messenger.", 1], ["It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it.", 1], ["So I think it strikes me as very likely that the next one is going to be around virtual and augmented reality.", 1], ["So I think geographically we are seeing very, very good performance.", 1], ["You're also right that we are very focused on commerce ads on Facebook, that the great, great, great majority of activity is commerce ads on Facebook.", 1], ["And so Pages are a good and free and easy way to have a mobile presence, and that's something we're very focused on growing.", 1], ["And so people now are spending more time on the Store, they download more apps, and that over time translates into monetization.", 1], ["But overall, I believe this hyperscale plus hybrid architecturally helps us a lot with enterprise customers", 1], ["As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone and that's a combination of single digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X.", 1], ["And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads.", 1], ["So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves.", 1], ["Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts.", 1], ["But I think over the very long term, which is how you framed your question, we have a lot of opportunity.", 1], ["We saw a strong double-digit growth in premium.", 1], ["And then in addition, we're continuing to focus our product development around putting privacy first and that's going to, we believe, have some impact on revenue growth.", 1], ["We've had really great productive discussions with the Indian government, and I fully expect that at some point, they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country.", 1], ["If we're delivering on those three elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third-party.", 1], ["So that's, if you wanted to break it down into two more sustaining things, those are the types of things we're seeing in that number.", 1], ["And we're pretty excited about what that shows in terms of how video can be used in a really broad-based way but also a more personal way.", 1], ["And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number,", 1], ["I mean, my own take of this, I think this has gone pretty well and has done what we had hoped, although we've made a number of changes.", 1], ["So that's really the main focus.", 1], ["We've done such a terrific job, I think, of growing and focusing and the innovation we put in and having our sales teams, through investments we've made for the past couple of years, and competency building, land that at customers.", 1], ["And finally, just the strong work on the infrastructure team, both between hardware innovation done at everything from the network, all the way to the prox and their integration with each other as well as the software innovation being done on top of it.", 1], ["Whether it's first-party games or third-party games, we are best-in-class in that monetization and that's what's reflected in the results.", 1], ["And so I think the use cases on this much like our phones will be broad based.", 1], ["Based on that experience, we're now planning to expand our channel before the holiday", 1], ["So, we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this.", 1], ["And what we're doing on Messenger and on WhatsApp are really making sure that businesses can connect with people, and then in the early stages of testing messaging.", 1], ["When I talk about the premium services mix, in our Office Commercial 365 business being about 60%, that is what's driving whether that's the mix shift to E3 or ultimately to E5 you will continue to see and have headroom in that number but you are right, we are encouraged by the ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose those premium SKUs over time.", 1], ["So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing is increasing, what I would call, annuity relationships and subscription relationships with all classes of customers.", 1], ["I feel very good about that.", 1], ["Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them all well.", 1], ["And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us.", 1], ["In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they are on upgrade plans and so forth.", 1], ["So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi-billion dollar business for us.", 1], ["So we're very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming.", 1], ["So it's multiple services.", 1], ["Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter.", 1], ["But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver and I feel that we did that.", 1], ["In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern.", 1], ["We continue to be pleased with the growth of Instagram both on a user basis and on a revenue basis.", 1], ["Yes, I think in terms of our core advertising products and growth, it's worth really remembering that our core feed products for Facebook and Instagram are growing nicely and well.", 1], ["So I'd expect we would continue to make changes and evolve.", 1], ["So, we feel very good about that and we feel that we have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone.", 1], ["And so I see the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand and for people that really want the best products.", 1], ["So we think of the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows, but also people will use phones of iOS and Android, but they need both productivity, creativity, and security across all of this estate of theirs, and that\u2019s where I think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition.", 1], ["And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out.", 1], ["So having mid-roll ads, we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user experience, but that is going to enable the kind of content that I think is going to take us to the next level.", 1], ["I think we're going to get to where we need to get to there.", 1], ["So on Search, we already have one very big use case which is people basically using our search engine to look out pages and people who are on Facebook and that by itself is already one of the biggest search engines in the world.", 1], ["I think that this is going to become increasingly important not just from the perspective of what does the privacy policy say but how is this deeply designed into the products that we're building.", 1], ["Overall these areas around commerce and payments, I think are one of the most exciting areas of product development for the next several years.", 1], ["So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth.", 1], ["And so we're bringing all of our energies to bear there.", 1], ["So we see a role for all carriers, in fact including the delivery service partner program that we\u2019ve developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well.", 1], ["Advertising is going to be the way that the revenue comes in for the foreseeable future, but what we expect is as we build out more commerce-related features around shopping, and Instagram and Marketplace and Facebook and certainly, the private social platform that we\u2019re \u2013 that I\u2019ve been talking about I think will lend itself to private interactions around payments and commerce and interacting with businesses in that way, I think what we\u2019re going this is we\u2019re going to build more tools for people to buy things directly through the platform.", 1], ["and we continue to build our products to serve a wide variety of audiences, including Millennials as well.", 1], ["So for the first time now, we have the ability to go to an enterprise and talk about their entire data estate across Windows and Linux.", 1], ["The value that we care about here is helping to build common ground.", 1], ["So yeah, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers for sure, authors, as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers.", 1], ["today we use some basic signals like who you're friends with and what pages you like as some of the most important things for figuring out what \u2013 out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show and what are going to be the most interesting things to you.", 1], ["This growth rate is going to bounce around.", 1], ["We did see ARPU growth this quarter.", 1], ["It all comes down to customer choice.", 1], ["So a lot of what we've been trying to do is make it so that we build out the infrastructure, so that way WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram direct can evolve rather than being just places where you message folks.", 1], ["I think what\u2019s exciting about those platforms is that they combine the art and the science of both a creative canvas that marketers are excited about and targeting.", 1], ["From a revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there.", 1], ["So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas.", 1], ["And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership save incremental dollars, because of it at Whole Foods.", 1], ["I would characterize the launch of Status apps on WhatsApp as being a much smaller thing than a driver of 2019 revenue growth, and it's going to be more about Instagram and Facebook.", 1], ["In terms of the timing, this is really early.", 1], ["Video ads are important on our platform and the most important thing that\u2019s growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing.", 1], ["I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those.", 1], ["And the other one is the on-premises server number which is very good in terms of hybrid demand this quarter also with high margin.", 1], ["In the United States, which is usually the most advanced market, 35% of small businesses have no web presence at all.", 1], ["And now, I think we're starting to work through what the formula is going to be so we can take some of those rate limits off and let video grow at the rate it wants to.", 1], ["So this is about getting projects started, making those projects successful, making sure customers feel the value and get the value of their investment.", 1], ["So we're comping that.", 1], ["So, it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it.", 1], ["It\u2019s not the only market that we are working on obviously.", 1], ["And so, as of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started.", 1], ["But it doesn't stop in Azure.", 1], ["And so between all of those hardware products, as well as our gaming performance, another sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches.", 1], ["So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us.", 1], ["And on the testimony, these are important issues and I think that that was an important moment to be able to go and hear what people were wondering about and just to have a public hearing of answering all of the questions around Cambridge Analytica and what we knew and all the steps that we're taking on data privacy and developers to make sure that this doesn't happen again and to lay out all the different things that we're doing.", 1], ["We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering.", 1], ["So I think what you're going to start to see are people interacting with pages, maybe follow a page on Facebook or Instagram.", 1], ["On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business.", 1], ["But generally what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic.", 1], ["We have stated that we want to double the size of the services business from the level that we had in fiscal 2016 by 2020.", 1], ["The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall.", 1], ["So one area where I'm very proud that we're doing great work is around identifying terrorist content.", 1], ["So there's no single factor, but those are all contributing factors in terms of MAU growth.", 1], ["But its\u2019 going well and I think we plan to roll it out every where pretty soon, so that\u2019s the game plan there.", 1], ["And so having control later in the process is very valuable to us especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network.", 1], ["And the biggest thing that I think we can take away from this as we invest in augmented reality in addition to virtual reality, is that the phone is probably going to be the mainstream consumer platform that a lot of these AR features first become mainstream rather than glasses form factor that people will wear on their face.", 1], ["So in our commercial business, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of continuing to outpace IT spend on an overall basis by continuing to push customers to our annuity business whether they are on -- on premise or the cloud.", 1], ["So that's one place where as you know, any AI project first starts with data, and that's one place where we are seeing good traction.", 1], ["Also, from the currency point of view and the weak global economies, we don\u2019t overly focus on this.", 1], ["So we are putting more compute behind that.", 1], ["Obviously, third party sellers are an important part of our value proposition there.", 1], ["It just we are now shipping more and more of our, other demand out of our warehouses, because of the strength in retail and FBA.", 1], ["So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there.", 1], ["And our ability to do that is why we're investing in the Audience Network.", 1], ["we feel slightly very good about where we are right now in the cycle.", 1], ["But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.", 1], ["And then we're continuing to invest heavily in our innovation investments.", 1], ["So between both of those and the first time buyers as well, it seems really, really good right now.", 1], ["So that is great.", 1], ["So I would say, yes, we had -- as we've mentioned the last couple of calls, we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity.", 1], ["And the best way we've done that is by simplified ad products.", 1], ["But overall, I mean the reason why we\u2019re interested in this as the social company is that we think that this is going to be a new way that people interact.", 1], ["So, attractive investments we believe, but ones that will take longer-term to pay off, and those would have a dilutive effect on margins in the near-term.", 1], ["I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related.", 1], ["And so I think, we'll keep investing in those areas.", 1], ["So the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone.", 1], ["I would say the overall change that we are going through, and this has been ongoing for I would say the last multiple years, is transforming our field engagement model, where we're putting a lot more technical depth in the front-line sellers so that they can engage, whether it's data specialists, cloud specialists, security specialists, or even productivity specialists.", 1], ["So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.", 1], ["And so I\u2019m really happy where we are currently, and happy enough that we\u2019re looking forward to expanding into more countries in late June.", 1], ["So it's a bit of an investment that has implications for a lot of elements to your cost structure, but we're very happy with Kiva.", 1], ["So I think it's the combination of all of that.", 1], ["As we always do when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within.", 1], ["But I think we're doing good work there now and it's growing quite quickly.", 1], ["But the more we can do it, even in studies with each client, the better our ads get.", 1], ["And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low, I mean in some cases, it's zero, that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world, that will buy smartphones and we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.", 1], ["And so there's no doubt about that.", 1], ["But we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season.", 1], ["So I would not characterize it as a cycle.", 1], ["There are things that remain relatively similar as we launch new products.", 1], ["We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions.", 1], ["We try to make it very easy for businesses to promote pages, promote posts and the like.", 1], ["For the smaller portion of our business it\u2019s still non-annuity per transactional, it does provide as I talked about earlier some opportunity but it\u2019s not that large just because the nature of the commitment our customers now is far more of the annuity type.", 1], ["And I think a lot of the success that we've seen has been because of some of the work that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News Feed and I mean that team has executed really well.", 1], ["So the pricing is really about what is the pricing that you're seeing in the overall system primarily driven on the Feed-based products.", 1], ["So on AI, I think that there's a very big shift in how we're going to think about content moderation on the platform.", 1], ["I do think the upgrade market will look at larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to -- how often and so forth.", 1], ["Whether it's frankly our views on gaming that Satya just discussed, I feel like the signal we're hearing is that we're in the right part of the market with customer-focused value that can deliver a high ROI

seeing in North America.", 1], ["And so we've worked hard to build measurement tools into the products, so that when you buy an ad, an SMB has a very easy interface and decide what their goals are.",

targeting.", 1], ["So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh and we've now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year.", 1], ["The team has actually done nice job in that segment, created some really modern offers, to get back and to enhance market that as well.", 1], ["We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops.", 1], ["But in our case there are two unique aspects.", 1], ["In the more temporal bucket this quarter as well as last you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature.", 1], ["And so we\u2019re really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country.", 1], ["So Reactions is going to rollout on every platform.", 1], ["So we're excited about what we're building there.", 1], ["And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising.", 1], ["So, that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base.", 1], ["And so, if we start to focus on one number or the other, I think we're missing the fact that our customer method and go-to-market is actually through the overall product portfolio.", 1], ["So our success in building - continuing to build good advertising products for our e-commerce clients on the advertising side will be a more important contributor to revenue in the foreseeable future than the new area.", 1], ["On the business side, I think we have both pleased with the results.", 1], ["That is a new experience that we're building, and building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it, and we'll see where that goes over time.", 1], ["That doesn't say that there is not a nice market for a home one.",

prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers.", 1], ["As I said earlier this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment and so hopefully that can turn into a positive for us.", 1], ["The last thing I'll say is that I think these things are more connected than people realize, in the sense that we're already seeing some nice traction with click-to-Messenger ads.", 1], ["And so overall, we do think that this tablet that can replace your laptop is ideally suited for productivity needs, which means it's great for your personal use as well as your use inside of the enterprise, and we continue to see good growth.", 1], ["But our focus is really on ensuring that we\u2019ve got capacity from available resources, whether it\u2019s our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure we\u2019re able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.", 1], ["And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces.", 1], ["First, we're continuing to add our AWS sales and marketing teams.", 1], ["No plans to bring that in-house.", 1], ["So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month, and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month, Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with.", 1], ["The opportunity I believe in both cases is high,", 1], ["The team did a great job of getting into supply demand balance there in December.",

and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business.", 1], ["Yeah, it was an incredible quarter.", 1], ["And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.", 1], ["In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true, that the upgrade cycle is longer.", 1], ["The one additional thing I\u2019d mention, which is increasingly becoming clearer to us is operational sovereignty will become important, the world and its distributed computing needs is not going to become some margin as set of requirements but it's going to be very heterogeneous, very in many cases regulated and so what we provide in terms of both the technology and the business model I think shows up with the maximum flexibility.", 1], ["So when you can both add to your install base and add overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business for our long-term goals.", 1], ["We're focusing more on shorter-form content to start.", 1], ["So I think the fact that we've already gotten 2 million advertisers to move into Stories is because we've gotten better at making it easier.", 1], ["The second factor is just anticipated changes that mobile platforms will make that will make targeting and measurement more difficult.", 1], ["So just on the question of how Oculus would affect the cost structure, it's premature for us to be giving guidance on the cost structure in 2016.",

computing evolves is that it's going to be more distributed, not less distributed.", 1], ["In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth.", 1], ["So sort of everywhere I look I see significant opportunity.", 1], ["Now, at the same time, in order to make this experience good, there also needs to be good content in the system, right, so we need to make sure that people have the tools to able to share the moments that they care about.", 1], ["And so that's what, that and our new products give us great confidence headed into this holiday season that this is going to be the best holiday season yet.", 1], ["So I would say, we do plan to continue to invest aggressively in the business going forward, and we are going to see, obviously, a margin impact from that in 2019.", 1], ["And so there will be volatility in this number, but the consistent theme of being double-digit billings that really match our strength in Office 365, I think -- and I do expect to continue.", 1], ["And, Walter, I think the way you see that show up is really in my conversation on FY 2019, to Satya's point, really we talked about that server product and KPI being high teens through FY 2019.", 1], ["And so I do think it will be a blend of those.", 1], ["If you think about our history, people made the shift to mobile before marketers did, and I think one of the successes we've had is we made it easier for advertisers to move into a mobile environment.", 1], ["I think we've made real improvements there, but I think there's a lot more we can do.", 1], ["So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.", 1], ["So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering.", 1], ["Over the last few years, we focused a lot on a number of major social issues everything from preventing election interference to reducing harmful content to protecting privacy.", 1], ["But we're going to need definitely continued support of our external transportation partners.", 1], ["We were very encouraged by the results this quarter.", 1], ["We do it with you know a combination of price and capability that we think is unmatched.", 1], ["And in fact, if anything, this release of Windows 10, just the way we have built it with the Insider program, everything is of course speeding up", 1],

the gross margin side you'll see some gross margin percentage pressure in that segment through 2019, but with significant dollar growth.", 1], ["With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact at a couple points either way, but I don't think about that as really immaterial impact.", 1], ["The main focus is on helping people capture and share any moment that they want, and also the whole theme that we have around community plays out a little bit differently on Instagram.", 1], ["So Messenger-only usage is not having a material impact on our overall usage stats.", 1], ["On that second point, in terms of how we think about the capacity we might have for our own, I think you know \u2013 I\u2019d start with, you know we\u2019ve got a great relationship with third party carriers across the countries where we operate.", 1], ["This is always going to be a lumpy business.", 1], ["So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy.", 1], ["So, when you think about segments the majority of these relate to the AWS segment.", 1], ["Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out.", 1], ["But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime.", 1], ["On the OEM side, the way to think about those comments is we do expect inventory levels to likely remain low as we exit the next quarter as well.", 1], ["We continue to believe we're delivering great ROI for advertisers.", 1], ["So I think less about it being cannibalistic", 1], ["and so it's is an area that we're focused on.", 1], ["So, I actually feel very good, but as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory that you are not seeing frankly much impact on the gross margin line and we are seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line.", 1], ["It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA program.", 1], ["So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp still stays about consistent as it was.", 1], ["So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products.", 1], ["In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know,", 1], ["On the other side, AppleCare, I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June, so really strong performance, but our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected, because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers.", 1], ["And the best articulation of this that I can make is that today, AI has different strengths than people do.", 1], ["The Azure pace is not, if you drew a line, as correlated to EAs as it even was 3 years ago, as we've I think matured the product and matured our sales cycles.", 1], ["We feel good about this lift-shift modernize motions that are happening.", 1],

as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing a good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally.", 1], ["We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market.", 1], ["As we look out into 2019 further, that's - the macro economy is certainly a potential headwind and risk to the business just given the sensitivity of the advertising business to a slowdown in growth.", 1], ["And then in terms of payments, there's multiple approaches that we're taking there.", 1], ["But right now, we're developing them somewhat independently.", 1], ["So there'll be more pricing pressure there", 1], ["We're pleased with the growth in time spent per DAU that we're seeing across the Facebook family of apps.", 1], ["On Ad Breaks for mid-roll video, early days pretty good result,", 1], ["And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work.", 1], ["On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth.", 1], ["So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here.", 1], ["We've been operating at scale for over 13 years

that will purge (40:38) some other demographic groups as well.", 1], ["In terms of regulation overall, I think that, that's going to be very important.", 1], ["And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things.", 1], ["So that is going to be the offset, and I mentioned particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment which is a headwind at this point.", 1], ["And the software team worked really hard to make that go back several versions of iPhone so that we sort of have hundreds of millions of enabled devices overnight.", 1], ["The video strategy is -- has been pretty consistent.", 1], ["And that product I think is a pretty revolutionary product", 1], ["I think we're just finally getting into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing and it's good to sort of see those in last quarter's results as well.", 1], ["So what we're seeing from DPA ads and carousel ads, we're really happy with.", 1], ["Obviously, those results would have been higher without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier.", 1], ["Our growth was really strong across all of our marketer segments, but we had a particularly good quarter in brands, I think driven by two things.", 1], ["And I would guess that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle.", 1], ["And so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward.", 1], ["So that\u2019s contributing to some of the deceleration, specifically as we look out into the remainder of 2019.", 1], ["On head count, I would just point out that our payroll growth tends to lag head count growth,

I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen.", 1], ["But we feel fantastic, particularly as it pertains to iPhone X.", 1], ["So there is a lot of investment going on and there will be continued, especially related to Prime.", 1], ["Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales.", 1], ["The second component is what I would put in a bucket of new business.", 1], ["So it would be early to be talking about large shipment volumes.", 1], ["As you said, I mean at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially.", 1], ["Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold.", 1], ["And then of course, we are very excited about E5, but they're very, very early days of E5.", 1], ["This has been happening over multiple years, but we have now got very good customer momentum", 1], ["So I would say that I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that that was great work with a - on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built previously.", 1], ["And then our Cosmos DB has become the leading multi-model, multi-region database.", 1], ["So we're really pleased with what we're doing on the revenue front.", 1], ["So it's gone very well.", 1], ["And so, the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first line.", 1], ["As there are more Stories and feed, as more people are engaged in Facebook and increasingly in Instagram, that gives us more opportunities just on the supply side of ads.", 1], ["And so, that's how I measure progress.", 1], ["And as I'd indicated before, the China rebound was broad based across the products.", 1], ["but the focus is really to build a rev-share model over time that's sustainable.", 1], ["The first thing is we're seeing longer commitments.", 1], ["To your second question on Office -- I'm sorry, on Windows Commercial overall, our real investment -- and you're right, we are starting to reach some tougher comparables.", 1],

the rest of the year.", 1], ["Yes, a couple things Brad.", 1], ["I think AR is big and profound and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it.", 1], ["And a lot of, I think, what we need to do is give people a way to see all of the videos that page that they like or follow is interested in sharing on Facebook.", 1], ["So, we\u2019re seeing strong growth across those platforms.", 1], ["And over the long-term, I think one of the big things that we need to do is see if we can not only make this good for engagement for our partners, but also a really positive business driver for them too.", 1], ["And those in addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion had been extremely well received.", 1], ["We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.", 1], ["And the answer is, it\u2019s a little bigger, but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 renewal base is actually almost equivalent

every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.", 1], ["The challenge is always going to be cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time.", 1], ["So that's clearly going to stay.", 1], ["So it's a number of factors, I would say.", 1], ["It has been remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets.", 1], ["And so that's been really a great story for us.", 1], ["And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution, not just on renewals in quarter, but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we\u2019ve seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed, because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction.", 1], ["And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain.", 1], ["If anything, all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly revenue driving growth.", 1], ["So, a combination of being able to understand the text that people message, read the articles that people would want to look at, watch the videos, look at the photos, are going to be great, too.", 1], ["And we still believe that over time every phone sold will be a smartphone.", 1], ["And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that.", 1], ["So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently.", 1], ["It's a very computationally and resource-intensive set of services that we provide and we need to build that out.",

membership to Prime flywheel, the additional benefits we are adding to Prime, not only in North America but also Internationally, and additional selection both retail and FBA which feeds the Prime flywheel.", 1], ["But our approach frankly is not changing over time.", 1], ["We are putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program.", 1], ["On Millennials, we were really pleased \u2013", 1], ["And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.", 1], ["But the core of our focus is still very much focused on ads and how we can do ads at the product level.", 1], ["On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line.", 1], ["In terms of larger developers, if you step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are two key constituencies in that equation.", 1],

tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers.", 1], ["Yes, we're very excited about the partnership with Adobe.", 1], ["So I would say that is a continuation of last year.", 1], ["And the advantage of that is also that some of those can be single player experiences.", 1], ["And so our task is to convince people that currently \u2013 or have another type of phone to switch, while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose \u2013 when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone.", 1], ["So we're seeing a lot of strength.", 1], ["Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa.", 1], ["So we're very ready to go.", 1], ["So we think about this part more holistically, and same thing with Dynamics.", 1], ["And we agree that we are underpenetrated there.", 1], ["And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers.", 1], ["As you've seen, we guided up sequentially in revenue.", 1], ["It's true in North America and our more developed markets within Europe, but I wouldn't say there's any real surprises there.", 1], ["We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year.", 1], ["So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1.", 1], ["And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe with looking at the results.", 1], ["I think this is going to be an exciting year.", 1], ["At the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling.", 1], ["So even going forward, there's going be revenue share back to the content creator, so it's going have a different margin structure than the core business.", 1], ["And so I think we\u2019ll be able to show the progress we\u2019ve made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward.", 1], ["So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting that segment.", 1], ["You know one of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands.", 1], ["And so what that shows is our growth is being driven by the ability of us to do this broad-based consumer media advertising but do it in a more targeted way.", 1], ["And then CapEx, we'll see continue to flow in through the P&L over time.", 1], ["And so we think that certainly we want to provide the best advertising, we certainly want to provide the best measurement, but our ability to do so as long as things happen across the industry, which is what's happening, I think we remain in a very strong position.", 1], ["And for that reason, we think mid-roll is a better user experience.", 1], ["So we would expect expense growth to ramp throughout the year, largely due to the factors that we've talked about on prior calls in terms of what's driving the overall acceleration.", 1], ["So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points.", 1], ["Watch and AirPods are doing incredibly well.", 1], ["The geos I specifically called out obviously were we're the most impacted and they're the bigger geos.", 1], ["So you will see more going forward.", 1], ["And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be

computer systems that are better than people at each of those things.", 1], ["We're very happy with that.", 1], ["Even this quarter is a great example.", 1], ["but we believe there are going to be opportunities as we further scale those properties.", 1], ["So I think that's going to constantly be a thing that plays into the desktop revenue.", 1], ["So let's start with the $239 million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we partnered with.", 1], ["So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we want to invest in over the

most important way that we're thinking about this whole space overall.", 1], ["And I think you're going to be able to look at these transparency reports as we issue them and see that we're continually making more progress, finding more of the content proactively, taking - getting better at taking it down, getting better at not distributing stuff that's borderline.", 1], ["We're encouraged by the improvements we've seen year over year.", 1], ["And we're going to invest both in people and technology", 1], ["That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this and we are hoping that calm heads prevail.", 1], ["So there's a lot of room to expand that and that's just a big opportunity for the Internet overall and for India over the next decade

selectively because we have more perfect information we know where our demand is, we know where we're moving things between warehouses and sort centers and by not involving third parties all the time, we can find that we can extend our ship cut offs, or excuse me, our order cutoffs and we've done that over the last few years.", 1], ["So, I'd say, we're around the second phase of that in search now.", 1], ["Overall, we continue to expect each service is going to get better and better.", 1], ["We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India and we see great momentum and success there, so we continue to invest and we have some of our best people in that business.", 1], ["And so we remain really optimistic on China.", 1], ["So really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described.", 1], ["They were very broad based.", 1], ["So the best way to measure our progress is Office 365 subscription growth, Azure growth and EMS growth.", 1], ["What we really want to go for is time well spent.", 1], ["So, for the video tab, the goal that we have for the product experience is to make it so that when people want to watch videos
